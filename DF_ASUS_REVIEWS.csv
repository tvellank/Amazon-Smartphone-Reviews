It even has FM Radio; I can listen to the radio without using data or Wi-Fi. Finger scan feature works flawlessly.",NA,"ASUS"
"5","B079142R7Y",4,"false","One of the better inexpensive phones at the $200 range. I am swapping this out with a Honor 6x. While I thought the Honor 6x was a good phone the phone lacked a decent camera and was uberly laggy and would crash at times. The finger sensor is fairly quick on the Asus and the phone is agile for 3 GB ram. I am not a heavy gamer so I am unsure about the heating issues but that is standard. I have run GPS while charging on the phone and it does not heat up. I mainly use it for emails, productivity applications, texts, and phone calls and the occasional picture. I purchased one through Amazon Warehouse and it was in excellent condition and I saved $70. It works great with AT&T.",2,"ASUS"

"17","B079142R7Y",1,"false","This is by far and away the worst smart phone I have had the misfortune to own. I only bought it because it was cheap at the Verizon store, and my wife already had used up our credits for a new iphone. You can't see the screen in daylight. That's it plain and simple. I've tried all the settings and they have little to no effect. The touchscreen is insensitive in normal mode and hypersensitive in glove mode. Either way, it will annoy the hell out of you when you can't swipe to get your calls or your breath on the phone ignites some almost random response. As soon as I save up enough credits I will get something else - ANYTHING ELSE - than this phone. You have been warned now!

I haven't had any problems with playing games, streaming movies or music, or taking photos. The camera isn't the most high tech and won't give you razor sharp photos, but still functions and will give you better photos then any non smartphone that I know of. The only issue I have encountered is that there will often be a slow down on your WiFi connectivity while you are using Bluetooth on the phone which can be a bit of a downer for wireless headphone users, but even then for the price you pay it is a very good product",1,"ASUS"

"24","B079142R7Y",1,"true","Pros: 1. Very inexpensive functional smartphone 2. Unlocked with 2 sim card slots Cons: 1. ZenUI subject to crashes and restarts (but really, can you expect this $200 smartphone to be as stable as a +$500 smartphone?) 2. Not durable. Without any rough treatment it stopped charging with only 10 months of use. 3. Asus support. Filed an RMA for repair under warranty and more than 48 hours later no response.

"25","B079142R7Y",3,"true","So initially i was hyped about the dual rear cameras but they are not the best. A standard should be set by ASUS with regards to the RAM. 3Gs is not practical and for such a small amount of memory the processor is too slow. However the phone is usable and reasonably priced.

"40","B079142R7Y",5,"true","Excellent phone. Sleek, powerful, fast. Great battery life. Could not be more impressed. Update: After the first bit of use I have found that the phone still performs wonderfully and flawlessy, apps run smoothly and videos play without a hitch. I am most impressed by the battery life. Older phones I used you had to charge twice a day or more with regular usage. The Zenfone Max Plus lasts me two days on a full charge with regular usage. Quite impressive for the price. The only issue I have noted is the lack of wifi calling and the occasional delay of incoming SMS or the inability to download MMS. This is not the phones fault as I had the exact same issue with my previous phones. It is due to sub par T-Mobile service in my area. Otherwise the phone is great.",10,"ASUS"
"41","B079142R7Y",2,"true","Keep in mind i really wanted this phone to work... Where should i start about this? While this phone is really stylish and has some really strong features, like it's camera, it's missed a lot of my calls and sent a lot of my calls to voicemail (and it's set NOT to) and i run a business and can't afford to miss some calls because let's face it, some customers just are NOT that patient. lol This whole ""smaller is better"" thing (in the GUI layout) doesn't appeal to me. The older, classic Android bottom of the screen, larger icons, layout was something i enjoyed and didn't realize this phone doesn't like that idea until i got it. The phone actually looks bigger, on every review i've seen, than it does when you get it. The phone is SUPER speedy...until you start putting a decent number of apps on it then stars slowing down. My Galaxy Note 5 did NOT do that. The whole ""euro"" way of doing things, on this phone, bugged me like them using the word ""Telephony"" and it was set for US english. This feels like an international phone that was sold as not being that. Pulling the menu down, with this phone, seems to be an ""extra"" effort (at times) and immediately got me irritated. The fact that it only updates to 7.x (for the power it's supposed to have) i thought was pointless. It should have been able to go to Oreo (Android 8.0) with ease. The USB ""micro"" connector...c'mon people, that's old (and easy to break off) technology....let it DIE. USB-C is what's happening. This phone just feels like they started out strong designing it and got lazy about mid-way through and just wrapped it up and sold it. Amended Information: Just before i sent this phone back, it constantly lost connection with calls and refused to connect with my Bluetooth. This phone, with all it's power and features, has to be the worst phone (of it's kind) i have ever experienced. 24 hours before i sent it back: The battery stopped wanting to charge. It's almost like this phone ""knows"" i'm send it back...this is weird.",7,"ASUS"

"59","B079142R7Y",1,"true","Unboxing this phone.. I was in love. It's sleek and light but feels solidly built. Setting it up was a breeze and before I knew it I was on my way to installing 3 different system updates. Unfortunately after the 3rd update installed and I was able to start USING the phone I was plagued with system UI crashes, prompting me to either wait for the UI to work properly or close it now.. At first it seemed to happen every 5-8 minutes.. then it was multiple times in a row within that 5 minute window making the phone completely unusable. I spoke with support and tried resetting everything back to factory. I was curious whether it was due to the 3 separate system updates I had to install initially so I chose not to install those.. but sure enough, after 24 hours powered on I was back to the endless UI crashes so I returned it per supports suggestion. In the return process Amazon had sending a replacement as an option and I took them up on that because I wanted to be able to LOVE this phone. Alas.. I booted up the replacement phone and encountered the exact same UI crashes. After some searching online I see that this is not an unknown issue with the phone so I returned the replacement as well and am off to find a better alternative.",7,"ASUS"
"60","B079142R7Y",5,"true","For budget unlocked phones, here are some of the names to consider in the US: ASUS, ZTE, Alactel, Huawei/Honor, etc. They all work seamlessly with ATT and Tmo on 4G LTE bands. Now with ZTE in trouble on the trade war with China, ASUS is a great replacement. Also this one can have dual sim and exclusive Micro-SD work together. Asus is probably the only manufacturer is doing dual-sim with exclusive micro-SD slot in the sim-tray. Another phone with such capability is Honor 5X. This model however, is 2-3 years old. So far I have no problem in call quality, bluetooth, and wifi connection. The phone is also light in weight, compared to the ZTE Blade 8 Pro. Fingerprint scanner is fast enough, though it's in the back. It's not a USB-type C, but the charging speed is fast enough. So far I like it and hopefully to keep it in the next year or two.",24,"ASUS"
"61","B079142R7Y",5,"true","So far so excellent.

"82","B079142R7Y",1,"false","This phone was bought as a replacement recently. Originally there were numerous Apps suddenly closing, but the majority were cleared out once the system was reset with a clean restart instead of a complete backup. The only issue currently is that the phone stops constantly with the same error; System UI isn't responding. Currently I am still looking for a fix, though I think that it might be related to the ZenUI Launcher. The issue seems to happen once the icons started to be grouped. Still not sure if this is the definate problem, but once I reset it, the issue went away until the icons were regrouped again. Love the phone though, once this issue is resolved, I think it is pretty good.",3,"ASUS"
"83","B079142R7Y",5,"false","Overall I am very very happy with this phone. I came from owning a Samsung Galaxy s8+ prior to this phone. Life / work demands changed and needed a second phone number. Dual SIM was a must as I did not want to carry two phones. I was a bit skeptical before buying a dual SIM phone as I have read about their short comings. Call forwarding works flawlessly between AT&T and T-Mobile. To my knowledge I have yet to miss a call when on one line and another person calls me on the second line. The Good: Battery life. When I first used the phone (at full charge) the phone said remaining battery life was 6-8 hours. I was like whoa this is not going to work. After a few days (I'm guessing android or Zen Ui) learned my habits and the phone displays ~30 hours of usage time. Yesterday I used the phone for 6 hours ( roughly 2 hours of talk time, 2.5 hours of Amazon music, and roughly 1 hour of onscreen time/YouTube/internet browsing) and the battery was 88%! Pretty awesome in my book. The screen is good enough in my book. Not as good as my s8+. But I do like having a slightly shorter phone because I feel the microphone picks up my voice better than the s8+ and one handed operation is much easier comparatively. ZenUI is great. Settings and navigating the phone did not take long to learn. Dual SIM and SD card. Most phones make you give up the SD card for a second SIM. US major bands and US warranty! Hard to find in a dual SIM. The Okay: Fast charging is meh. I do miss the quick on my s8+. This phone takes around 3 hours to charge from almost completely dead to full. My Samsung took half that. A key note. Make sure you use the boost feature to close app/ free memory before charging as it significantly reduced the charging time. Samsung pay was a nice feature for the times when I forgot my wallet. But I knew I would be giving that up with this phone. Speaker quality is decent at best. I feel it needs to be louder but it is audible from 20 feet away. Wish the screen would get dimmer for using the phone in bed. Phone is good enough in bright daylight. No problems in the Florida sun! The Bad: The camera! The camera takes pretty good pictures in bright light. Lowlight pictures are terrible (think a fuzzy webcam). The wide shot mode is kind of a gimmick at least to me. The picture quality suffers in this mode. It looks decent in bright light / outside. No android Oreo! Asus promises an ota update but when?? I have read the mediatek chip supports their version of quick charging but who knows if this phone will ever support it(would not get your hopes up). I bought this phone with the expectation it will not. Overall this phone is great but has it's shortcomings. I definitely feel it is a good midgrade phone especially for the price. Picked this one up a day before prime day and Amazon adjusted the price for 149 for me! Thanks Amazon! Tremendous value!!",2,"ASUS"
"84","B079142R7Y",4,"false","If you're looking for an inexpensive, decent quality cell phone with a battery that seems to never die, this might be the one for you. My most recent phones have been from the Galaxy S series by Samsung, so when I compare quality, I am comparing them to some of the industry's flagship phones. The ZenFone Max Plus is an excellent choice of phone for those needing a smartphone, but who are also on a budget. I liked everything from the feel of it in my hand to the user experience with Android's interface. This phone is quick and responsive, and yet I never felt like I was holding something that is a quarter of the cost of a Galaxy S series phone. The display is crystal clear and has good color quality. The touchscreen is responsive and the OS is one of the better Android experiences I have had in quite a while. But it is the battery life that sets this phone apart. I forgot to charge the phone (MicroUSB, by the way) one night. I looked at my phone in the morning, dreading what I would see as far as what battery life was left. However, I was surprised to see 70%+ charge still available, that's after a full day's use! Now I know your mileage may vary from mine due to variations in usage, but I was impressed to say the least. Audio quality is good, Wifi was decent (2.4Ghz band only), cell reception was decent as well. I haven't used the dual sim cards feature yet, but it could come in handy for those who want to use a single phone for both business and personal use. One down side of this phone, is that being a carrier-free phone, reception was just okay. I used it with T-Mobile in the Denver metro area, where I usually have very little trouble getting reception no matter where I go. In most areas, the phone reception worked great but when I pushed the limits such as inside a large building, I wouldn't get a signal. The other down side is the camera, it performs fairly well, but when comparing it to my Galaxy S7--which as its release had one of the best cameras in the industry--it falls short by far. Overall, if you are looking for a great phone on a budget, this is it. I was pleasantly pleased with this phone in more than one area, but especially with the cost vs. quality and what you get. If you're looking for a phone in this price range, I cannot think of a reason not to recommend it.",NA,"ASUS"
"85","B079142R7Y",4,"true","Okay. Camera is a little quirky. Not near as good as the Zenfone Zoom",1,"ASUS"
"86","B079142R7Y",1,"false","Bought the phone sold by Amazon in June 2017 mainly for the dual SIM capability. The phone prompted me of an over the air update, which I installed. After the update, it still runs Android 7 (nougat). No further update to Android 8 is available. The phone supports LTE for SIM 1 and 3G for SIM 2. It doesn't say whether it supports VoLTE, it doesn't give any visual feedback, so I assume it doesn't. It doesn't support WiFi calling - it has no option to enable wifi calling where it otherwise would. Let's come to the main issue. In the first SIM slot, I put my T-Mobile US nano-SIM card from my old phone, a Samsung phone that supports LTE and wifi calling. In the second SIM slot, I put an international SIM card which I use while traveling in some countries. I set SIM 1 to LTE and SIM 2 to 3G. The phone is not receiving a lot calls even when there is full signal. I even tried calling from another phone on my family plan sitting in the same room where both phones had full signal. This phone doesn't receive calls or even text messages a lot of times. The caller at the other end does not hear any ringback, it goes straight to voicemail. On my end, the phone doesn't ring or provide any indication of an incoming call or new text message. Eventually, if I make a call, then it fetches the missed calls and voice mails list. Until I make a call, the phone connection is literally ""offline"". When I make a call, the phone radio or whatever comes alive and fetches text messages and voicemail alerts. New incoming calls will come through for a while. After sometime, it again starts behaving like it's offline. This is extremely frustrating since this makes the phone only useful for initiating a call or text message, not for receiving them. I switched the T-Mobile SIM to 3G, but that didn't make a difference.",1,"ASUS"

This phone blows my last 2 phones out of the water. I previously had the LG Stylo 2 and that was basically a paper weight with a Stylo pen lol but it got the job done. Recently I had purchased the Moto e 4, and if that's any indication of the direction the Lenovo lead Moto brand is headed with their budget phones then Im sure the Motorola from its 00s heyday is turning in it's grave. I should have gone with an Asus phone to begin with since their computers and computer parts always deliver.

"107","B079142R7Y",4,"false","I bought this phone as a standby phone when my Samsung Galaxy S8 had an issue. The build quality of the phone is excellent with a metal body design. Other than NFC it has almost everything that is expected in a smartphone. The display is good and clear and did not observe any issues in bright sunlight. The 4000+ battery with heavy use will last close to 1.5 days. The phone get fully charged from 0% to 100% in 3 hours or less. Bluetooth initially did not find any devices, however after a restart everything was good.The phone may confuse many users who switch from iPhone/Samsung/Motorola/LG which show LTE for LTE connection. This phone show it as 4G for an LTE connection. This phone has an FM radio, Calculator, currency converter, Unit converter and application lock as part of phone UI. The easy mode and kids mode in phone will be useful while giving phone to seniors or kids. The audio recording option in call is also a good feature of this phone. In short, this phone has everything that one may look for. The camera of the phone is good in bright light, however do not expect it to be equally good in low light photography. Now to the downside. As a phone if you are using near your ear or with a head phone or with a Bluetooth headphone everything will be fine. However, if you are in a conference room and put the phone in speakers not everyone may understand what others are saying in call. The same applicable for others as well. If you put the phone in speaker mode while driving, then it is a disaster. You will not understand anything the other person is saying in call. I am still trying to find an option to resolve this major issue. In short the speaker is just average. It is loud, however the quality of sound is just average. This phone is yet to get an upgrade to Android O. Also, surprisingly this phone does not come with an ordinary earphone in the original box. Overall, the phone is good for its price. Update on 9/2: After more than a month of use the following is my experience. I use phone a lot. I did not experience any call drop due to phone issues. Connection to Bluetooth headset has issues at times. It drop connection back to phone while talking. Battery will last more than a day, however it will not be enough to cover the second day. Camera is more like a hit or miss. Daylight photos are 70% success. Low light photography has only 20% success. At times, the camera app crash or freeze. Speaker volume is good and loud for watching videos and music. However, for call it is unusually weak and I don't know why it is so. The phone will need close to 3 hours for full charge. However, initial 50% charging can be achieved by around 40 min of charging. As we get closer to full charge it slow down charging. That is my observation. The phone did not show any slowness. It still has Android 7 with latest security patch. Also, received an update to Zen UI. No issue observed with GPS. Occasionally, it get warm while using GPS. The phone does not get warm in long hours of call or internet usage.",3,"ASUS"

First time I seriously used the camera for a little bit the phone crashed, and was left trying to restart fro 20 minutes... then it came back up. The first time I used the Gps for a longer trip the screen went off. I thought the phone shut down, but after a couple of minutes it gave me some directions ""in a quarter mile, turn right"". The screen was completely black- leaving me stranded until around 30 minutes or so, when it came back up. Sooooo pros: - Great camera, except in low-light. But it's not a flagship phone, so I'll give it a break. - Feels great in the hand. The form factor was a bit weird at first, as advertised, but I liked it. - Best phone battery I have ever tried. - Pretty slick cons: - Unreliable / dubious quality. My friends with flagship phones were probably envious of the price, until it crashed and was non responsive for the longest time. Then all I got from them was ""you get what you pay for"" This is the second ASUS product I have to return, the previous one had hardware malfunctions 1 week in. I never try to troubleshoot products if they malfunction badly in the first weeks (I learned from previous experiences)- so I didn't contact support. Maybe it was bad luck.

Crisp enough photos for a medium level phone (haven't used the wide angle camera enough for a review) 3. Processing is smooth and touch is very receptive. 4. Fingerprint sensor is in an ideal spot, very easy to set up multiple prints for access from any angle. Cons: 1. Video quality is ok when zoomed out but crappy if zoomed in. 2. Not many variety in accessories for sale since this is a fairly new phone. Should change in a few months though...hopefully 3. The speakers can get blocked easily since it's at the back where your hand usually holds the phone. It's good if held a little of the palm so that the sound bounces of the surface but can get a bit annoying to get used to. A speaker or earphones will solve this problem. 4.

Dual-camera is great, but I do miss the seamless slo-mo video option that my previous phones carried. Focusing on the letters can be a challenge at times as well, but for a fairly lit environment, the pictures look great. Battery life is good, but those of you heavy users will still need to re-charge at least once during mid-day. Phones looks and feels like a real deal. My co-workers did think this was Galaxy S9 and we compared them side by size, they really did look alike. Also, there might be a learning curve to this phone with very limited instructions. It took me a while to figure out that the screenshot feature is activated by pressing down POWER+VOLUME DOWN at the same time. So why 5-stars? Simple: I would rather buy a $199 on a phone than a $899 phone that is marginally better.

First the phone work I got it as a place holder because my v20 is giving me way to many problems and I don't want to upgrade to a new flagship yet. Here are the basics: the phone is smooth but I wouldn't call it snappy. The cameras are ok. (The screen is actually pretty good) The speaker is not really good and for some reason the are two speaker grills and only one speaker maybe my model is defective. (I actually called Asus and they confirmed my thought on my speakers being broken) The fast charging is not super fast but the battery is also huge. ( I ended up getting a full days use out of the phone with no need to charge.) (The Ui is very easy to get used to. By the end of the day it felt normal) Over all for a budget phone I am happy with it. I was able to just pop in my sim and transfer over everything fairly easy. Yes this is the US version i did call Asus to make sure and they confirmed it. I think they just don't send the correct paperwork with the phone.

The phone is taller than the regular version and not as wide as first this bothered me a little bit but I realized it's much easier to use one handed than the other thicker models. Also take note the phone requires a nano SIM card I am having to wait for my new sim to arrive before I can call or text. The only downside I have experienced is the phone runs warm. It's normally sits around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. I installed the new pubg mobile game and it ran it perfectly but my phone was getting extremely warm not like it would burn you or anything just very warm but not a real issue the phone didn't crash or anything the game ran very stable.

"147","B079142R7Y",4,"true","I really like the phone but I had to take off one star because it lacks Wi-Fi calling. Find this odd because with all the features this mid range phone comes with you would think it would come with Wi-Fi calling. Where I live the signal strength is spotty so having Wi-Fi calling would be a nice feature. I did reach out to Asus in regards to Wi-Fi calling and they did finally admit that it does NOT have Wi-Fi calling after they first told me that it did. I want to touch on the subject of performance. Keep in mind this is a mid level phone and not a flagship so I wanted to compare it to my Note 4 since it was old technology, having come out in 2014, so decided to do a bench mark test using an android app Geek Bench 4. Here are the scores: Max Plus: Single core score was 442 Multi-Core Score was 962 Note 4: Single core score was 1065 Multi-core score was 2879 As you can see there is a quite a difference in performance between the two phones even though the Note 4 is older technology but was a flagship phone when it came out (although I did not buy it when it first came out). Having posted the scores I have not had any issues with performance; but I do not play any high graphically based games on my phone only card games or something like a bubble shooter. Playing music or videos has not been a problem and is plenty loud just using the built in speaker. It is important to mention that the phone only supports wifi 2.4 ghz connections and not 5 ghz. Oh and as far as it being ""fragile"" I have not experienced any issues but of course I have not dropped it either. But since the phone lacks gorilla glass, or even if it did, I would recommend a glass screen protector and a case (but I always do that for every phone I buy). The phone seems to be built well and have not had any problems with Bluetooth and hooking it up to the computer to transfer files although you may have to enable usb debugging in order to transfer files when using a usb cable. Which by the way is micro USB not USB c which is becoming more common in cell phones. The camera also has a fair amount of features (grids and such) although it does seems a little slow if you are using the flash but other wise is responsive and takes pictures quickly. One of the best things is the battery life which is higher than most phones especially in this price range. Conclusion: If you are wanting a mid level phone that has a lot of features and will not break the bank compare to a lot of the flag ship phones out there I would recommend it so as long as you do not need Wi-Fi calling. Even though it is slower than the Note 4 I was using, it was not an issue for me, and this phone would be perfect if I lived in an area with better signal strength and or it had Wi-Fi calling.",38,"ASUS"

"149","B079142R7Y",1,"true","I wanted to warn everybody against this product. I had ASUS phones before and they were good. This is a product which should never pass any quality control in US. The photos are atrocious: dark and blurry, when you press the on screen button, it captures 1 in 10 photos. The ""aluminum"" case cracked after 3 days. It's clearly plastic not aluminium. After 1 month, I started to get messages that my device is corrupted and the system started to crash! Daily! Now (3 months since the purchase) The screen appear to have a crack which goes side to side across. I never even dropped this phone. It just magically appeared under the screen protection film I have on. I contacted the ASUS customer service, based in Caribbean...just to be advised that for the reasons they could not explain my phone is not under warranty...Stay away from ASUS. They are being pushed out of the market by Xiaomi which explain the declining quality of their products.",1,"ASUS"

"151","B07CLT3BDN",5,"true","So far really like this phone. Just got it today and had no problem setting it up with Straight Talk and an AT&T sim card. Wanted to point out that it will quick charge with other chargers that have QC 3.0 not just the wall adapter that comes with the phone. The only grip I have is you don't get a notification that it is quick charging you get like 3 + signs on the battery symbol which is really hard to see but without quick charging you get the lightning bolt symbol and that is easier to see; so no lightning bolt means it is quick charging. Will update my review later when I have had the phone for more than a couple of hours. Update: 11-25-18 I would not recommend using the AT&T sim card with Straight Talk if you use google voice. Had a lot of issues sending text messages using the AT&T sim card and google voice once I was away from wifi. I had to tap on resend like over 5 times on text messages before it would send if it would send at all. Now once I switched over to t-mobile every text I sent went the first time every time when away from wifi. Perhaps it is different depending on were you live but where I live in FL this has been my experience. On the subject of battery drain and I am not sure about other phones but this phone allows you to setup a lower power setting mode automatically during the night for example. So I have mine set from 11 pm to 7 am to go into a lower power mode which over an 8 hour period my battery only went down by 3%. This to me is a really useful feature because I read online that to help your battery have a longer life you should not leave it on the charger over night so I charge it before I go to bed and or after I get up in the morning. This feature really helps to keep the battery close to full for when I get up in the morning without having to remember to change it manually. Can't say I like the Asus default interface (can't add a folder to home screen unless you combine two apps together which then makes a folder) but I use lightning launcher to replace it and it works without any issues. It costs $4.99 and is definitely worth the price allowing one to setup your home screens exactly how you want them. After a couple of days of use I really like this phone. Yes it may not be water proof, or have wireless charging, but I like the physical design of a phone that has a flat screen; because I think the screen is better protected when you put a case on it since the case creates a lip all the way around the screen (of course I also use a glass screen protector). Correct me if I am wrong but all the phones that have curved edges to the sides of the screen aren't going to be as well protected even by a case should you drop it; because the case does not create the lip like a flat screen phone and it will land on the screen instead of the edges of a case.",8,"ASUS"
"152","B07CLT3BDN",5,"true","I've had a great experience with every feature of this phone. I love ZenUI on this phone, it's light and snappy. The snapdragon 845 in this phone won't let you down with performance. As for connectivity, this phone has a great LTE antenna (4x4 MIMO) I get a stable LTE connection where my previous phone wouldn't even detect the network. I use AT&T in both the US and Mexico. Along with this, I absolutely love that this phone's dual sims BOTH support LTE connectivity. Switching LTE data between my SIMs is merely a menu setting instead of having to swap the sims between the slots. The camera works great. I'm no photographer, but the pictures look every bit as good as the galaxy s9+ to me. It's also extremely nice having having the wide angle lens for scenes that just don't fit into the regular lens. The full hd IPS display has a full, vivid range of colors and it's bright enough to view outdoors in the sun. I've heard a lot of negative things about IPS vs AMOLED, but consider this.. IPS has no screen burn-in, (I've seen really bad burn in on the S5 for example), IPS is brighter, and it is also far cheaper. I'd rather not pay a large premium for a screen that just isn't noticeably better. Regarding review on the lack of Tmobile VoLTE and wifi calling, why even use legacy voice networks when you can use a VOIP service like TextNow and stick to wifi/data? VOIP is portable, it can be used on any device and is not bound to any hardware or a sim card. VOIP services typically have unlimited texting and calling over wifi with cheap to free international calling. Also instead of wifi, it can also be used over any type of network (including LTE and even 5G when it rolls out) so techinally VOIP can use VoLTE on any phone that supports LTE data. The battery life is great, a full charge can get me through almost 2 days moderate usage and I leave LTE data or wifi on all the time. It charges very fast with the included quick charge. Overall my experience has been great with this phone!",22,"ASUS"
"153","B07CLT3BDN",4,"true","I've read a lot of the reviews on this phone because I've been waiting dearly for it. I switched to this from my Motorola G5 Plus. The biggest issue I've had comes from the LTE bands. It only supports three LTE bands for Tmobile. Tmobile has bands 2, 4,12, 66, and 71 for 4G LTE in the United States. Band 71 is brand new making it irrelevant in this review. Anywho, this phone in the United States for Tmobile only supports bands 2, 4, and 12. This would be totally okay if living in a big city of sorts. I live in rural America so I don't get the full support of all the Tmobile bands. This is by far the ONLY reason I am returning it. My Moto G5 Plus did me well with 4G LTE data since it supported 4 of the bands versus three on this phone. Of course most of the phone you buy directly through Tmobile should be able to use the full support of all 5 Tmobile 4G LTE Bands. I don't game on my phone. I use your majority of social media apps. Facebook, instagram, snapchat, etc etc. I bring this up because I've had no stuttering what so ever from the on board 6GB of ram. This thing rolls like a champ. It never has heated up or over heated on me. Battery life has been solid. For days where I barely use my phone, I leave the house at 100% and return home at 70% roughly. That's pretty awesome after a full day of work. Obviously your mileage will differ if you spend a heavy amount of time on your phone. I think on my heavy usage days I got it down to roughly 40%. I still had plenty of juice to function for awhile. All in all it is an amazing phone for what it is and what it costs. If you live in a better area with the full support of those three Tmobile bands, you'll be fine and I totally recommend it. If you're living out in small town rural areas, I would not recommend it unless you're on WIFI all the time at home and work. I hope this helps.",91,"ASUS"
"154","B07CLT3BDN",5,"true","This phone is amazing. This is my first Android phone and I'm falling in love with it. I was fed up with my iPhone 6 being practically unusable, so this phone has been the perfect gateway drug to Android. The screen takes almost the entirety of the phone and it looks really cool. It has an AUX cord port unlike the newer phones out there and even has fingerprint and face recognition. 5 stars!",21,"ASUS"
"155","B07CLT3BDN",5,"true","Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  The best way to summarize the deals with this phone is to tell you that it has 6GB RAM, dual cameras and a snapdragon 845, for $500. Thats literally half the price of every other flagship with the same specs. And sure you could go to the oneplus 6 and mention that, but this also has expandable storage or dual sim ability. Which is a pretty hefty weigh in. And its from ASUS, they are pretty much amazing in all they do. I've never had an ASUS board fail on me. There are a lot of things that I absolutely love about the experience I'm having with the Zenfone 5z. And I must note that I am upgrading from an old Note 4 to this so its a pretty big upgrade. Inside the box you get the phone, some good quality headphones, a clear case for the phone, a sim removal tool, and the charging block with the cable. Its an all glass phone using gorilla glass 3, and everything looks very sleek. There is a notch though but that can be hidden easily in the settings. The biggest difference is the performance, through and through its strong and can handle pretty much everything. Multitasking is very well managed on it and gaming has never been smoother. Apps load up very quickly and tasks are performed close to instantly. Its charging is very quick as well. The AI charging is very handy and you can have a full charge in less than an hour and a half. The camera is one of my favorite things about it. It automatically picks settings based on what you take a picture of, can adjust the lighting of the picture with a tap. You dont have to be limited to the AI camera though, you can set it to pro mode and have fun with all manual settings for the best picture. It can do that background blur effect as well as wide angle shots. ZenUI is quickly becoming one of my favorite launchers recently as well. I almost put nova on until I started noticing several little features that I really appreciate. The way it works just feels right and is very easy to get used to. Would I suggest you buy this phone? Yes, instead of spending $1000 on other brands, get this instead. Its a better deal all around.",10,"ASUS"
"156","B07CLT3BDN",5,"true","Great phone. Works just fine with t-mobile in my area (non-rural PNW USA). It lacks some modern day features - waterproof comes to mind - but it performs so well and seems pretty inexpensive that I don't let that affect my opinion of its awesomeness.",NA,"ASUS"
"157","B07CLT3BDN",5,"true","I have used the ASUS Zenphone 3 Zoom for the past18 months and have been happy with the function and reliability. It has been a good phone, but I have never been a fan of the camera. The ""telephoto"" camera simply was not great , although the wide angle camera was pretty good. In addition, Android 8.0 just never seemed to be quite well thought out. When Amazon sent me a blurb about the 5Z at a good price I decided to upgrade. The larger screen, the improved camera, bigger storage, and most importantly, the larger RAM (6 Gb. vs. 3 Gb) were attractive. I had run into constant loss of signal (cracking and random noise) when using Bluetooth earbuds, as my Zenphone 3 indicated it was using 2.8-2.9 Gb of memory on average, essentially all that the phone had. I spent the 3-4 hours necessary to transfer everything to the new phone and am VERY happy with the upgrade. The same earbuds now work flawlessly. The new phone indicates average memory usage of 3.7 Gb, well below the 6 installed. The screen is brighter and easier to read. The fingerprint reader is GREAT for unlocking the phone. Android 9.0 feels like a finished and well thought out operating system. I especially like the ""intelligent"" features, like the auto-brightness. If it is too dim in darkness, you increase the brightness and it remembers you want it increased the next time you are in a dimly lit area. It also is much more visible outdoors. Haven't used the camera much yet. The battery life is not as good as the Zenphone 3 Zoom but appears adequate. The ""fast charging"" really is fast. My only hiccup involved a update several days later. The phone lost my fingerprint registry and would not unlock with my passcode. Finally after about 30 minutes of trying it did and has been working fine since. I suspect it was a buggy update as I found others with a similar complaint. I think the problem was the wrong keypad was displayed, one without an enter or checkmark key. Finally, one was displayed with a checkmark key which allowed the phone to unlock. Normally you never have to hit that key, but for the initial unlocking it was required.",4,"ASUS"

"161","B07CLT3BDN",4,"true","I've been using this device for 2 days, so far so good. The Zen UI is very easy to get use to and a bit tricky to customize the interface. The screen is excellent, It's one of the best calibrated IPS screens out there, but regardless it's still an IPS display, there's a noticeable difference of deep blacks if you wanted to hide the notch. I can't judge the camera as it will often than not it would overexpose the lighting and the so called ai camera along with its auto-HDR mode would display inaccurate colors and non-vibrate pictures. Not sure if that's the case for every zenfone but it definitely needs software improvement (using the latest patch as of 8/10/2018). The software is what I worry the most, asus doesn't have the best record of updating security patch and android system. I'm still rocking andriod 8.0 even though the Oneplus 6 which came out at the same time is using andriod 8.1. Oneplus also guarantees at least 3 major system updates in which the asus does not. Now onto the price, it's indeed the cheapest phone using the Snapdragon 845 chipset, but ordering it from amazon within United States would cost around 33dollars which brings it to the same price point as the Oneplus 6 (Oneplus 6 doesn't have a physical warehouse in most of the states), B&H are exempt from sales tax but provide no return and customer service option. All in all I have to say unless you'd care about 30grams of extra weight, no stero speakers and micro sd card tray then go with the oneplus 6, I've not notice a signicant difference in terms sound quality when I cover the front facing stero speaker, The Oneplus 6 has a more vibrate Amoled display that's able to hide the notch a lot more better. The only bummer for the Oneplus 6 is that It would take about 10dollars for 4-5 day shipping and around 11 days for free standard shipping, wheras amazon prime and B&H gets free 2 day shipping.",6,"ASUS"

A little bummed by the price point since it's actually cheaper outside the US but it's still a great deal. I use it with T-Mobile and have no issues at all with 4G here in the SF Bay Area, CA. Out of the box you'll need to do the updates - it has 3 in a row so I'd do those before loading up apps and such. Wish Asus would have just made 1 version that worked world-wide instead of the ABC versions with different bands. I hear they aren't going to bring the 8GB ram model here so hopefully someone figures out how to unlock ALL the bands on this phone so I can buy it overseas for less and give this one to my wife.

She enjoys using my phone over hers. The sound is average(to be expected out of a slimmer phone). The fingerprint scanner is my absolute favorite and hasn't messed up once on my friends and family members attempts in hacking it. The color quality really pops on the screen. THE CON: Yes the phone is compatible with AT&T and works great in larger surrounding areas BUT I have noticed a big difference in reception in the country. When the phone is using extended networks or other towers, reception is terrible. My girlfriend and coworkers have AT&T and they all will be able to make calls when they have one bar of reception. My phone will just drop the call before it even connects. So the since it's not an AT&T branded phone I think it does lack slightly in reception compared to others.

"206","B07CLT3BDN",3,"true","This device is very nice. I have not had any issues getting through the day on battery. The dual speakers leave a lot to be desired at maximum volumes. It becomes very distorted at higher volumes. I usually listen to YouTube videos at around 50% volume which sounds great and is plenty loud. I personally prefer LCD IPS over AMOLED for peace of mind when it comes to screen burn-in. The screen gets bright, but my OnePlus 6 has a brighter screen. I have no issues with the screen color or viewing angles. The device is incredibly smooth and the OS is well optimized. The signal propagation is strong, and I mean very strong. In areas where my OP6 and Galaxy S8 struggle, the Zenfone 5z will maintain a much stronger connection. I'm on T-Mobile USA for the record. The issue however is this device does not support T-Mobile VoLTE despite Amazon Q/A stating it does. As a result, in areas where t-mobile offers only Band 12 LTE as coverage, you will not be able to make phone calls. This is only in very rural areas but it is something to take note of. This device also does not support T-Mobiles newest LTE band, band 71. This is still in early rollout stages but for the longevity of the device, it may become outdated as more markets get Band 71 rolled out. Anyways, the device will drop down to HSPA (3G) to perform the call. Call quality is good, but I would've preferred VoLTE work out of the box. This device is not provisioned by T-Mobile or Asus to support VoLTE. I will attach a debug screen with personal information cropped out if you're interested. Without VoLTE or any plans from the company to rollout an OTA to enable it, this device will likely be going back. I do hope the manufacturer can respond and clarify why the device does not work with VoLTE.",30,"ASUS"

Thus, I have taken to deal shopping on Amazon and taking the phone into the store to get the SIM card set up to get 4G service. I am on ATT and it was easy getting the phone to get full 4G service. The Zenfone 5Z is my second Asus phone. I was pleased with the first one (a Zenfone 3 Zoom). The 5Z is an almost flagship phone at less than 1/2 the price. The processor and memory zip through things I need to do on my phone. The cameras are very good. (I use my phone camera extensively for work and often need to show detail in low light conditions. I get the picture I need most of the time with the 5Z) The screen is crisp and vibrant. The speakers are interesting. (kind of weird?) The 5Z plays stereo through the speakers at the top of the phone. (The speaker you would listen to while using it for voice calls.) And the normal speakers at the bottom of the phone. These speakers have very different power output and it creates an unbalanced audio experience. That said, listening to songs this way can reveal nuances in instrumentation you would not have heard otherwise. It is not very water resistant. I learned this when I dunked it in the water while mountain biking. It went into full-fritz mode. I could not even keep it turned off. Eventually, it ran out of batteries. Then I put it in front of a fan overnight and everything was back to normal in the morning. That said, if you need to use this phone in situations that could involve water, I suggest getting a dry-bag or other waterproof container for it.",2,"ASUS"
"220","B07CLT3BDN",5,"false","I've been waiting for this phone since February or March (can't remember). I'm so glad I waited and got this over any other device. Meanwhile I was suffering with a terribly slow and problem ridden htc bolt. Just some heads up for those buying his phone in the US, This is the model to get. It has all the necessary bands to connect to lte. I am currently using cricket and get amazing internet speeds. Now here is what I've learned from my week of use. For the price, this thing is a steal. It has similar specs to the Galaxy s9 and note 8 for roughly half the price. The snapdragon 845 paired with 6 gigs of RAM make this thing incredibly snappy. I'm a heavy user and I've noticed that this phone doesn't hiccup at all. I can say this phone hasn't gotten hot or froze, no matter what I throw at it. The screen is pretty good and the notch really isn't a big deal. I think the one on this phone looks good. The UI is incredibly smooth and apps launch instantly. This phone currently only has one storage option for the us version, 64 gigs. It also features an SD card slot for expandable storage. On top of that this devices using a type c charger with quick Charing support and it works great. Another important feature is the headphone jack. I've learned that phones with type c to adapters aren't that great. They tend to become loose, so music on my bolt would occasionally blast out the loud speaker. So I'm glad this one has the jack. The camera on this thing is great, but since I'm not really into cameras in general, I don't have much to say. Next, the battery. It's 3300mah. And generally will last me till the end of the day if I'm careful. Wish it was a bit larger in capacity, but it is what it is There are so many features to list so I'll just say this thing is packed with great features that you can explore if you buy this phone. Next up is build quality. The glass on the back is such an amazing touch and the metal frame really adds to the solidness. Overall the actual phone is a great buy. I really like that asus throws in a free case and headphones. I would highly recommend this phone to any one any time. At this time I don't have any cons, other than maybe a relatively short battery life. But that all depends on you.

The phone loses points due to some display scaling problems, mainly evident in Google Assistant, and some touch screen inaccuracies. The aforementioned ZenUI heavy-handedness also packs some minor annoyances, mainly involving some overly aggressive power management. Overall it was okay to use, but I ended up returning it and going back to my OnePlus 5T.

"234","B07CLT3BDN",5,"true","Make no doubt, this is a flagship phone. Has pretty much top specs all over. Ive been using it as my main phone since late October and I have no plans to change. Im on Tmobile USA and it works pretty much great with it except no Volte and no Vowifi. I don't understand why OnePlus can get that to work but Asus can't because those are almost must-haves nowadays. But it is fast and responsive. Moreover it is relatively lightweight which I was surprised to find I very much like after using heavier phones. Even though I prefer Amoled displays I must say this is a very nice LCD. Colors to me are great. Nice sharp detailed look to everything. And it is more responsive to touch and swipes etc than any other device I own. The camera is the best Ive had on a phone. Great in low light. Doesnt overprocess like some phones do. Easy A grade for the camera. And one of the big reasons I got it was the speakers. They sound excellent. I listen to online radio lots and lots through the day. Really impressive loudness and richness for phone speakers. Another easy A grade. The software is well done with good Asus apps. Nice options. No complaints there. I'm hoping the Zenfone 6Z has Volte, Vowifi, a slightly bigger Amoled screen and all the rest it currently has. Just a fantastic seemingly underappreciate phone. 4.8 stars. Edit March 2019: Still really enjoying this phone. Although I take back that I would want a bigger screen. This screen is the perfect size. Had a chance to try out larger phones and Asus really nailed it with the screen size, screen ratio, and overall size/weight of this phone. It really is the ideal form factor. Big enough to enjoy watching vids and surfing yet still pocketable. And the weight is just amazingly light.

"237","B07CLT3BDN",3,"false","Like many here, I have an unlocked HTC 10 and replaced it with a Zenfone 5Z. My HTC 10 has been having antenna woes to the point where I want to smash it out of rage. In general, I was not wow-ed by my HTC 10. It wasn’t loud enough, the front facing camera has terrible image processing, and they sold it as a 32gb model. I’ve had my Zenfone 5Z phone for a couple weeks now and while I don’t do many things with my phones, I am quite knowledgeable and could be considered a power user. I am not satisfied with this phone, but it will do as a replacement for now. It’s not that it’s a horrible phone, but it has a couple large flaws and in general, a lot of little things that would make a difference. Let’s get the biggest things people want to know out of the way: 1: This so called “US” model is 64gb with a MSRP of $500. In reality, you are getting the “B” version of the worldwide model (WW firmware). Knowing this, for the same price or only $30-40 more, you could import the 128gb model. That’s double the internal space for so little! You can still get an ASUS warranty when you register the phone, so it’s not even a deal breaker. Do you really need this new phone right now? Go for the double storage! I think these US models might have an easier time dealing with support, but it’s not like you get no warranty. Don’t let that scare you. 2: the cameras are terrible. There’s no way around it and I can provide examples. My HTC 10 is superior to it and it’s over 2 years old. While the Zenfone 5Z sensor is the commonly used one in many flagships right now, it has a higher level of noise than I was expecting, but the real flaw is ASUS’s post processing. It is heavy handed and not worth $500 at all. Detail is ANHILLIATED. This is not the kind of phone you use if you want to pixel peep or zoom to 100%/1:1. When you do that, all you see is obvious physical smoothing and destruction of fine detail… on everything. Not only that, but the sharpening also has been cranked up too, to the point of where I can “sense” sharpening halos, even if I can’t see them. This camera’s essence, if I were to sum it up, is an unnatural look and blatant loss of fine detail. And the wide angle is the same but worse. The JPEG engine is also chucking out JPEGs at 15% sizes compared to the RAWs. Not 15% smaller, but 85% smaller – even if the processing was acceptable, it’s been compressed to hell! And let’s talk about the RAWs too for a minute: they are DNG with flat profiles, unlike profiled cameras that shoot RAW, they will not look acceptable with zero processing. The phone doesn’t even support Camera2 API! ASUS can tout their ""We love photo"" tagline until they are blue in the face and ""AI cameras that think for you"", but they can't walk the walk. Videos are nowhere near as bad as images, but panning in them can look off from time to time, even when in 60FPS mode. Front camera is ok though, would love to have autofocus in it, and it seems a bit wide, but it’s not too bad. 3: This phone made quite a splash when it was first introduced for being an iPhone X clone/ripoff. It has a similar looking back, a similar notch, even that “fruit phone x” presentation, however that is an amateur observation. This phone is really trying to be a budget LG V40. Yes, that phone was introduced after the Zenfone 5(Z), however it follows a similar AI-everything philosophy, it’s skin looks similar, it tries to add a lot of options without entering bloat territory. The LG V40 has more of everything: more screen control, more notch options, more cameras, more network support, just everything… but it also has more price and LG has been pulling the same heavy JPEG post processing for years now. So if you are drawn to this phone for the iPhone-like features, don’t be. It’s a shallow comparison. Now that that’s done, let’s get to things that range from good to needing work. Design: I have the dark navy one. It’s basically a cool toned black, and it looks great. I love the shininess, it even shows through the case it comes with (which will look disgusting in no time, even if you keep it in your pocket). I don’t mind the notch as much as I thought I would either. It is disappoint to not see as many icons up top, but at least the time hasn’t been moved to the left yet! Hand feel, it need work. It is really tall, and requires a lot of adjustment if trying to use it with one hand. I like to keep my pinky at the bottom of my phone and it’s really not possible. Headcase supports this phone so there is an extensive line of fashionable soft, hard, and leather cases for it, which I really like. Screen: The screen looks nice, but out of the box isn’t so accurate color wise. It has an auto temperature option, haven’t seen it do that much but it’s a cool feature. It also has a “screen color optimization” feature which seems to counteract a purple-ish hue? That isn’t explained so well by Asus. While you can adjust the temperature, gamut, and general hue/saturation, there’s not much you can do with it though. The blue light filter is also quite weak, even when cranked to the max, ands auto brightness sometimes has a slowness to it or just dims the contrast too much so I leave it off. The minimum brightness is also quite bright. It is an LCD, so it can’ be helped, but it’s something to mention. Perfectly fine screen for outdoors though. ZenUI: ZenUI is a good and this one here is an upgrade over the one in the Zenfone 4 (which I played around a lot with when I had a chance in the past). It is not that bloated, you can uninstall some stuff it comes with (like storage manager, system fonts), and a lot of ASUS brand features like OptiFlex, gestures, SOS thing, I can see how all of them would be useful. The game recorder (Game Genie) also blows third party screen recorders out of the water because it can record system audio without needing root because it is a system app, and the quality of the both the video and the audio are great. The system emojis chosen are horrendous though, just simply terrible. They are the gradient kind and a joke. Why, Asus? Why? Sound: I have a love/hate relationship with the sound. It is louder than my HTC 10 and it has controls to adjust it; however it never sounds quite right. The bottom firing speaker sounds good, so much better than the treble mess that is the top speaker, that putting the phone in mono mode actually sounds nicer from an EQ perspective, but then it sounds less dimensional because the top speaker is doing nothing! So close Asus, so close! Fingerprint sensor: The Zenfone 4 I tried had a wonky sensor. This one is a lot better, but something about it doesn’t inspire the most confidence in me. It may be the fact that it has a different texture than my HTC 10, however it doesn’t always recognize swiping on it to expand the notification bar. Networking: Haven’t noticed any problems at all like HTC 10. Mobile data enables faster (even when going from airplane mode) and I also am able to get signal in places I would not before. I do feel that YES, the SD 845 and glass build are responsible too, as iPhone 7's in the same room and some other SD 820 devices couldn't pull this off. I am on an MVNO of AT&T. All in all, I am torn. This software is better than I thought it would be, however it’s the little day to day things that add up and especially the camera. The camera is more appropriate for the cheaper, non-Z version. I don’t usually upgrade so quickly, however if the Zenfone 6 or something else is released that is similar to this phone but with a better camera, I may jump ship, but I’d rather not as I really do not like how Google ruined Android Pie (call recorders blocked as an anti-competitive practice, time moved to left, 4 limit of icons on screens without notches, Substatum needs root, etc). I would suggest looking at the regular Zenfone 5 instead of the Z version unless you really need the 845, as most of the internals are the same between the two models.",4,"ASUS"

"245","B07GX1DBD9",3,"false","First off I have to say I've had my phone for a few days as of writing this and as mentioned in many tech companies, this phone is slippery. I'm talking fish out of water slippery. Also the 1 time it found its way to the ground from 3 ft and the back so called gorilla glass has already completely shattered. My old blackberry priv has found its way face first to the ground from a ladder and amazingly enough didn't phase it yet this phone has already cracked b4 I could even get a case on it... Also, the camera leaves MUCH to be desired especially in lower light such as a living room at night with all lights on, the color is not very saturated and somewhat grainy. There are a million manual presets but starting in auto mode will leave you unsatisfied in lower light, not even dark. When it comes to video, the amount of light needed to produce anything usable is just ridiculous. Do not expect to use this camera indoors for video at all. The sound is plenty loud enough but once again no match for my black berry which isn't even a phone bragging about its features, yet destroys this phone in comparison. I will give its fingerprint scanner credit. It has basically always worked fast and accurately and the phone in general is fairly quick even with the amount of apps I have piled into it. But the zen ui, which I figured couldn't be as bad as others have nicked it on, isn't that great and is not very customizable... and once again, my blackberry has me liking it's capabilities even more. Its battery life is actually better than I expected and others have claimed. It takes quite a long time to charge if not using an ASUS approved fast charger, expect several hours if not using the phone while charging. You can get several hours of watching video on It at full volume and still have juice to make calls which seem to be the most energy efficient thing about this phone. In my opinion this phone just leaves me wishing for much more than what it can provide and I'm not asking for magic. Terribly disappointed in ASUS for this embarrassment of a product of theirs.",3,"ASUS"
"246","B07GX1DBD9",4,"false","These people blasting the ZenFone, I don't see it and I may have lucked out. (Treating me great so far) -Previous phone a Moto e5 Play- The speakers can go up really high (They are down firing at the bottom.) When you activate outdoor mode, it will sound tinny tin tin a bit. Sure it's locked to verizon, but I've gotten it unlocked to work with T-mobile; works fine. The screen quality for a phone at this pricepoint is great. I liked the phone so much I'm babying the hell out of it with a case, and a screen protector. ( I never do this to things I don't really care about.) At casual media consumption (Video and Music), I've gotten nearly 24 hours out of it. Bluetooth connectivity is great on this as well. Emulation: It can handle up to PS1 + N64 and PSP (bit laggy on the PSP). The fingerprint reader can hit or miss depending on the amount of sweat/ moisture your finger accumulates, but this tends to be true with the flagship phones.",1,"ASUS"
"247","B07YBVZ2PW",1,"true","To be honest the device is what it is. But the seller never said that it was a device that fails CTS safetynet check. This means the device is not Google certified and you won't be able to download and use apps like Netflix, google pay and so on. Anyways, had to jump some loops and install the correct WW roms to get this device certified. Any ways the product is 5 stars but the seller is a complete 0. I would advise being ready to re-rom this device if you are going to purchase it from this seller, if you don't know what CTS and re-roming is. I would advise staying away from this purchase.",36,"ASUS"

"250","B07YBVZ2PW",5,"true","Lovely phone for gaming! And the refresh rate of the screen is just sublime. You'll never want to go back. The fingerprint sensor is sadly hit or miss but you'll enjoy the on screen factor and it still performed as one of the best ones I've tried so far. Asus nailed the phone and the software as well and this is coming from a current Pixel 4 XL owner. Only the camera let me down and even then it's a competent camera for a ""gaming"" phone",1,"ASUS"
