"6","B010CK8O9Q",1,"true","I am a dedicated Sony product consumer... I have never had these issues with any of my 3 previous Sony mobile devices, very disappointed in the performance of this phone. Battery only lasts 12 hours with medium use, all day if I barely even touch it. The phone heats up like crazy and the camera shuts off literally after 2 or 3 photos....

But, i can say it's a new wold, because nothing to compare with the others that i used before, And most of people think that a doble sim smartphone suppose to be a fake, but i really love it, and it's perfect for my daily use such as; sending email everyday,using office, so it's exactly what i expected, very fast...

"11","B010V43VFA",4,"true","The design of the phone is phenomenal have to say. Looks amazing. It does get a bit warm as everyone is aware. Not unbearable but I do have concerns about the longevity of the product given how hot it gets every once in a while. The phone experience overall has been amazing, camera very solid, performance good, battery will get me through an entire day without using stamina mode, and my Good app is constantly syncing so that is impressive. Sounds quality for music is good, call quality not as strong. I would say my previous phone, Motorola Moto X 2013, had better call reception. Design, look, and feel on this phone though is top notch. Great job Sony!",1,"Sony"
"12","B010V43VFA",3,"true","After lightly using it for a month, the screen started to bug out - the screen was flipped both horizontally and vertically (so that it was mirrored), there were colors everywhere (on the phone, I'm not talking about acid), and so the phone was not usable anymore. I'm assuming it was the digitizer, but I have no clue what caused it to break. If that hadn't happened, it would've been a great phone. Solid camera, speedy, it feels good to hold, and looks beautiful.",2,"Sony"

"16","B010V43VFA",1,"true","Pros: * it looks really nice. I have received many complements for this phone from people (at least to me) * it feels very nice and it is pretty sturdy! I have dropped it many times but it still works and the screen is not shattered. Cons: * Don't buy this phone. The overheating issue is not something you can look over. It makes the phone literally unusable. Overheating causes this phone to slow down significantly to the point you want to scream. Any app that uses the CPU intensively slows down the phone. I will list the top apps that you practically can't use: 1- Camera: YOU CANNOT USE THE CAMERA more than a minute or so. It becomes very unfortunate when you are recording a rare event (let's say a concert and your camera app shuts down because the phone is overheated. You cannot trust the camera for being quick and responsive either when your phone is hot. It takes a while to load and start working. 2- Maps (navigation): navigation is a CPU heavy process. That means it no camera or any other feature of your phone while that's happening. To be fair, you can make calls but the phone works so slow that it really goes on your nerves! 3- Snapchat: Snapchat is impossible to use on this phone. even if the phone is perfectly idle, Snapchat kills your phone. It makes your phone extremely hot in in tens of seconds and becomes unresponsive until. It's not to say you can't use it at all, it's just you have wait and be patient when you are using it. so if something is happening and you want to send a quick snap of that moment, you should forget about that! Even worse, if you connect your phone to a charger and open Snapchat your phone gets hot in no time and although the charger is still connected you battery percentage keeps slowly going down. 4- Skype: it's like Snapchat but a little better. You can't really use skype and multi-task. Skype alone is very heavy on the phone.",1,"Sony"
"17","B010V43VFA",5,"true","Absolutely beautiful, flawless phone. Can't wait to get it rooted. This phone is great in every way, the SD810 can run a bit warm under load, but cools quickly and doesn't seem to effect battery much. Sleekest phone with the best display I've seen since the Z Ultra.

"23","B010V43VFA",1,"true","Please be aware when purchasing this product from seller ""Telecomm Wireless."" This is model E6553 (single sim), but it came in a box for E6533 (dual sim). The rear camera was not centered in position and the screen quality is AWFUL. I had this phone when it launched and I sold it due to the heating issue, which is fixed with the latest update, which is the reason why I wanted to re-purchase this phone.",2,"Sony"
"24","B010V43VFA",5,"true","I've had alot of phones in my life, and before this, was using a Blackberry PRIV. I've always admire Sony's phones, but was disappointed they never made it to Big Red (Verizon) or Ma Bell aka Big Blue (AT&T). When my PRIV's screen cracked I decided to order a budget android. Long story short I couldn't do it and decide to see what a fairly recent Xperia would cost. MONEY WELL SPENT! I love this phone, and the fact it's unlocked is even better! No more waiting on AT&T to put their touches on an update before pushing it. This phone is beautiful...the prettiest phone I've ever owned (and I've owned alot (but never iPhones)). It's performance, so far has been on point, screen is very nice, camera is great, no heating on the back experienced after heavy usage and doing all the updates. I was able to delete/disable most of the pre-installed apps. Everyone knows Sony puts out quality and cutting edge products that are harmonious with it's Japanese roots. Unless they do something disappointing, they got a new life long Xperia phone user.",NA,"Sony"

"28","B010V43VFA",5,"true","This phone just blows your other phones out of the water. It quite literally is the best phone out there. If you buy itbrand new, international, Amazon is kind enough to include an adapter for the phone for wherever they are shipping the device to. The phone, brand new takesa few updates that'll take take around 3 hours to finish, but once you're done, it's Marshmallow(latest Android update) heaven baby. The phone, despite being a last generation Xperia Device can take anything you throw at it. Any app, any game, it'll heat up to a point, but not enough to shut it down or damage the device. Heat is only natural for these devices as there are no other ways to disperse the heat besides the built in heat sinks. And the heat is not a bad thing, that just means your phone is doing work. I give this phone a 5/5 for now let's wait for the upcoming weeks.",1,"Sony"
"29","B010V43VFA",4,"true","I found the phone to meet my daily uses and enjoyed the ease of a well thought design. However, heating was a small concern and the phone seems to freeze on YouTube vids while sound continues. Services are lte in area's while spoty even in well towered locations were smaller devices received lte. Which is a first for me and not sure if it could be a fluke. In ending this I can't help but realize I was only ok with this product and blame all 3 parties (me/Sony/t mobile) for a bland review. Sony work on heat dispersion t mobile fix tower issues(choosing 3 g tower over 4 g cause it's close, bad android)me keep research active to better my experience in the future.",2,"Sony"

Unfortunate, that is almost all i really got from this phone. after about a month, it started to slow down, after about 5 month, its like really really annoyingly slow, and freezes up a lot. The camera says that it can not be connected and it is not the best for a 20.7 mp. I'v had better phones for less the price.",NA,"Sony"

Love the lime gold color really sticks out because of how huge the phone is, really makes it easier to find when sat down. The front camera has a flash which is amazing. Camera quality is one of my most important features for me in a phone and this phone takes the best pictures ever. Headphone jack on the top :-) loud bottom edge speaker. There is an independent camera button that enhances the camera. Phone just feels nice, it's made of nice materials. I could keep this phone for a while. There isn't any lag on the keyboard and the processor seems up to snuff. The pre downloaded keyboard works good. I totez dig this phone.",1,"Sony"

"62","B01FJT7E3M",4,"true","I love this phone it is excellent for the price. The only downfall is no LTE on AT&T network you will get H and H+ which is basically 4G. Phone works like a charm otherwise it plays all games really well even intense ones like racing. And the sound alone is really well done. If your on the fence about this phone I say take the leap.

Consistent Bluetooth issues, it initially pairs easily but regularly has connectivity issues. Not waterproof, a lot of bloat ware that takes up the majority of the memory.

I had to leave it on that screen all night until it died, and then it finally turned back on. This phone is such a waste of money. Yeah it has a good camera, but that is the only good thing about it. It drops calls aaaaall the time, the reception is just terrible. There is hardly any internal memory. Today I have had to charge it twice already. If you're thinking of buying this, don't!

It came with only a charging cable and plug. The device had 66% power but I followed the instructions and let it charge for about 30 mins before setting it up. Setup was as expected. I am used to Samsung phablets, so this was a little different. This phablet is much larger than my Note 4 Edge. I felt the screen was crisp clear. The sound is very loud. The camera is amazing, really gorgeous photos and movies. Unfortunately I could not use my SIM card yet because it is a micro size and this takes a nano. It did recognize my microSD card. I was able to go online right away and download my apps. I watched a YouTube video and it had great sound and bass. Reading ebooks and listening to audio books worked well, too. I do not require a lots of bells and whistles. For the price, this is a good purchase. 10/30 update: I am using the Jaybird Freedom blue tooth wireless in-ear buds along with the downloaded MySound app to control the EQ. The sound is really good, good deep bass and not so much tinny sound. With great reluctance, this phone has finally replaced my Samsung Note 4 Edge.",8,"Sony"

I had to go through their Activate/Reactivate menu to purchase the card for a $1.00. Go to the menu that specifically mentions Sony and purchase that card. You have to click on the square that says AT&T unlocked phone. Once the phone was activated, I was thrilled. This phone puts my old Android to shame. The numbers and letters for texting and calling are big enough for an old man like me to see and they key in without getting two numbers or three letters I don't want because I have slumsy fingers.

There's a lot of reviews that are pre software update about LTE problems which have been addressed they've upgraded the software so the battery last longer. I don't get me wrong it's still not the longest lasting battery but you get about what you get with your other phones like the Samsung Galaxy and many of the other phones. Huawei has this hands down as does Apple from what I understand. Not much I can say bad about this phone few times the speaker has locked up on me and is not heard me when I was answering calls for asking Google a question. I rebooted a couple times and it's fine. It may turn out to be a problem although after the reboot it's been fine as I said. For the price I don't know that you can do much better it's a really good phone.",8,"Sony"

The phone top and lower frames are plastic material, already 1 small scratch on it once I open the box. Back is also plastic, soft and thin material. If you hit it by finger, you can feel gap between this back and battery. Battery life is really bad, put there 1 night, 20% battery drop. To get fast charging, you need to purchase extra charger. Screen is OK, but SONY font has issue for Japanese and Tradition Chinese. This is a hardware issue I think, the font database is inside a chip. Not sure if I should keep this phone.

"103","B01FJT7E3M",1,"true","Camera stopped working on the second day after release and simply states ""Unfortunately the camera has stopped working"". A quick google search revealed this is a common problem with Sony phones. On 8/11/2016 another update was released and now bluetooth doesn't connect. I am using the Ultra with T-mobile USA. The phone had no problem connecting to the network once the sim card was inserted but it takes for ever to initiate the call. After dialing a number or selecting a contact to call it takes a good 10-20 seconds for the dial tone to start. These calls are made in a major city and I have never had this problem with other cell phones. Coming from a note 5, the screen quality isn't the best. I was willing to sacrifice resolution for size but at this point I regret the purchase. I will be returning this phone due too all the problems.",7,"Sony"

"105","B01FJT7E3M",2,"true","Okay first let me say for the price this is a decent phone. I had it two weeks and had to return it because it had to many negatives. The screen for starters looks great and everything is smooth. The battery life was the worst I have ever seen, it was so bad I disabled the battery percentage because it was distracting watching it go down so fast. As with many Sony products I have had the volume with headphones is low for me. I obviosly don't have the best hearing but music and videos were low enough that I had to drag a old galaxy phone around just so it can act as my music player. On top of all of that the phone has terrible third party support. Don't bother with any of the screen protectors they have on Amazon, I tried three of the ""best"" and they were really bad. They didn't stick well and none covered the whole screen (despited all of them saying it did). I also ordered a few cases and the best one was only meh.. Most of them triggered the volume and power buttons so you press them by accident. It also doesn't include a fast charger, just a crappy one. Another thing that bothered me was that I could only wake the phone with the power button which is clunky if you have a case on. If you don't mind all of the negatives I've listed (perhaps you have great hearing) then this is a decent phone.",1,"Sony"

"108","B01FJT7E3M",1,"false","This is a fairly thorough review after 1 month of comprehensive use. I am a habitual smartphone user who is addicted to these devices for business and entertainment purposes. My previous brands were Samsung and LG phones. I decided to go Sony XPERIA XA ULTRA for the first time because I have used their DSLR Cameras with success and trusted the brand to deliver, but it did NOT.. PROS - Limited versus more popular brands. I fell in love with the stylish slick square body and clean edges. For someone like myself who does often business and reads documents through smart phones, I enjoyed the larger screen size. Unfortunately that's about it. CONS - Where do I begin? 1) Screen sensitivity is off. It's only been less than 1 month of usage, more and more often I cannot swipe to answer or decline calls. I would swipe and the 'green' circle would move across the screen half way and freeze. Phone would keep ringing and I keep swiping harder and softer but the 'green' circle to accept the call would be stuck. C'mon its only been a month and this is occurring once a day at least. 2) Smartwatch, does not function well with them or at least Samsung one. It picks and chooses it seems like. I used to get SMS, phone calls, and a variety of messenger apps notification from this phone to my smartwatch. Now, just FB notifications and mail, my phone will receive a call and it won't even notify the smartwatch anymore like it did the first weeks. I'll check my phone and see new messages, then check my smartwatch and nothing, but it'll continually send me notifications of other useless updates. 3) User friendly function is extremely basic on the Sony OS. with LG and Samsung, it was super simple and clear. It's hard to explain, but it's as if the developers didn't bother to make this as user friendly as they could've. Things that are simple on other systems like call forwarding, putting on speaker, transferring to blutooth, etc. isn't as simple on this phone. 4) Media files are not recognized, specifically videos. I would download a video of a movie or TV show. When i move it to the SD card because the phone only has 16 gigs (12 gigs already used by Sony software), if I ever take the SD card out to transfer files, it WILL NOT recognized the movie file when I put the same SD card back in. The file is still on the SD card, but it is not recognize. If the SD card was NEVER removed in the first place, the video file can be played again and again off the SD card. At least 6 times so far, if I removed the SD card, all video files is not recognized on there. Even though the Xperia was used to download, play and transfer the files. 5) Inaccurate Battery Display - I've caught it twice with inaccurate battery display. The first time, just 3 days after the 2 week return policy ended, while on the web, it notifies below 15%. Less than 30 seconds later, it completely turns off. Another time, it notifies below 15%, within 1 minute, it states 1% left. 6) Battery Life - awful, just awful. I am not even video graphics heavy. I don't even play games. This phone is almost dead before the sunsets. 7) Charging lag - for such a small battery, this phone takes an incredibly long time to charge. 6) Screen barely dim. From the highest setting to the lowest setting is like 1 shade of brightness. On the absolute LOWEST brightness, I can still read the screen clearly without effort outside on a sunny day. 7) Poorer Cell Signal receiver. I've been at the same job in the same desk for 3 years. I get about 2 signal bars where I am. With the other phone brands, I make calls and SMS fairly smoothly. It all went down with the Xperia. I would have text come in with 20-30 min delays. Often I would leave the office and get up 5 new voicemails because their calls didn't go through while I was in my office. 8) Slow camera. Slow to turn on, slow to focus and very poor with night pictures on auto mode. The selfie camera is supposed to be best in class but it does not make up for how deficient the back camera is.",NA,"Sony"
"109","B01FJT7E3M",5,"true","Its such a shame that Sony has an incompetent marketing team since they come up with such great products. This phone is one of them. I've had mine for a little over a year and its great for the price.

"112","B01FJT7E3M",3,"true","giving it 3 stars.. this phone is pretty good bought it for the large screen and I love it. there isn't a lot bad about this phone but! the biggest problem is the internal memory(16gb). I watched a review video once, the reviewer said phones with 16gb shouldn't exist, I didn't believe him and bought it.. I regret it so much memory management is such a pain. have had this phone for more that 5 months but this problem is pretty much chipping away at everything that makes this phone good",3,"Sony"
"113","B01FJT7E3M",4,"true","I mean, let's be honest. This isn't the highest spec-ed, fastest, most versatile phone out there. But for the price, however, it is one of the best budget smartphones you can buy. Out of the box the first thing you notice is how big it is. This. Phone. Is. Big. But not so big that it's ridiculous. You won't look like one of those ""trying to be cool but definitely not succeeding"" dads walking around with an enormous iPad taking pictures in the park, so no need to worry about that. The second thing you may or may not notice is the build quality, which is easy to overlook. It's a solid phone with a nice bit of weight to it, which is nice because it gives it that 'premium' feel at a not so premium price point. It is kind of slippery though. Luckily I haven't dropped it yet, but I did have a few close calls. Now I have a case on it, just to add a little extra grip. But other than that, I have no complaints. It feels good in the hand, and I think that's what really counts. Now we come to the part that most of us bought this phone for. The screen. It's big. It's bright. It's wonderful. I mean it's no Samsung or Apple display, but for the price it's definitely well above average. Color contrast ratios are great, the brightness level is awesome, but it can also get dim for use at night without compromising image quality. My only complaint is that sometimes images aren't as sharp as they should be, like when looking at a picture online or watching a video on YouTube (but that issue only occurs pretty rarely). Overall, a big thumbs up. There are a few things wrong with this phone, though. My number 1 complaint, as with most users of this phone, is the lack of storage. It feels like there is almost no room for apps, images, videos, etc. Now you can somewhat remedy this with the purchase of a Micro-SD card, but even then you can only store images, videos, and other files on there, not apps. And apps are what eats up most of the storage on this phone. So if you're someone who needs 100 apps on their phone you should 1.) Reevaluate your life and probably put your phone down and go outside, and 2.) Consider a different phone OR cut down on your app usage (see previous point). But if you're like me and don't have too many apps, and mainly use your phone for what a phone is meant to be used for (calling & texting) with a few apps thrown in there, then you should be fine. Another issue I've been running into, more recently after having the phone for a while, is lag. If you have too many apps open at once, or even sometimes for no reason at all, the phone will lag. I mean most of the time it's not a big deal, just a second or two here and there. But I did think it was worth mentioning. Also I've been having an issue while making phone calls, where the person I'm speaking to has a hard time hearing me. I don't know if that's just a ""me"" thing or of other people have been having the same issue. I find myself having to put them on speaker and hold the phone so I'm speaking to the bottom of it, directly into the microphone in order for them to be able to hear what I'm saying. That, or I have to speak very loudly. Just something worth noting. CONCLUSION: This phone, though not as high-end as a Samsung or Apple, or *insert your preferred flagship smartphone brand here*, it's pretty great. And at $270, I don't think you can do much better. It's got a great screen, pretty decent battery life (roughly 1 full day of moderate usage), a great camera, and lots of other little perks (like a great speaker, which I was pleasantly surprised by). So if you're in need of a budget smartphone, I think this is the way to go.

"118","B01FJT7E3M",4,"true","- A great device with very sleek design language, it makes you wonder why this isn't the standard on all Sony phones. The 6 inch screen allows you to enjoy all your media content, colors are vibrant and punchy despite not being an AMOLED display and makes the experience far more immersive than a screen with a smaller size. - As of writing this review the device comes with Android Marshmallow. It's expected to get an update to the more current version Nougat - but there's no promise of that. Anyways the OS is buttery smooth while multitasking and Sony has opted to basically give you stock OS with a few tweaks and designs to make it their own similarly to Motorola and the MOTO G line. - The speaker is an improvement over the phones predecessors in the C5 and Z Ultra respectively, but the placement is again in that awful spot. It would've been nice if they added an extra earpiece and made it front facing instead. - The main con of this phone is of course the 16GB of storage, which is abysmal when you factor in that Sony has added a few bloat apps that cannot be removed and while the phone allows the use of SD cars the device does NOT allow an adoptable storage. It's 2017, 32GB of storag and at least 3GB of ram should be considered the standard for all mid-range phones. The battery is also on the smaller side at 2700 mAh, it should get you through a day of use, charging the battery is also slow as Sony gave this phone Quick Charge 2.0 -- but the charger is sold separately and not released in the states yet. - If you've read this far, you're probably wondering if I'd recommend this phone to you. Yes, yes I would. A great phone, an even better multimedia device.",6,"Sony"

"140","B01FJT7E3M",4,"true","Great phone for the price. There are only two nitpicks that I've found with it: (1) I don't know what the deal is... but sometimes when I'm in camera mode and setting up for a shot, the on-screen shutter button just disappears. I have to fiddle with it for a minute, or leave camera mode and return, to get the on-screen button back. It's really frustrating, and I missed out on a lot of shots due to it. Eventually, I just started using the physical button on the side of the phone to take pictures instead. All that being said, both the rear and front-facing cameras on this thing produce some pretty amazing results. (2) I wish I had just dropped the extra hundred bucks, and gotten the 32GB version rather than 16GB. When I first bought the phone it came with Android Lollipop, which had great support for moving apps to an external microSD card to free up space. Since then, Sony has pushed an over-the-air update to Android Marshmellow, which makes it a lot harder to do this. There are workarounds, but it's a real pain... and the thing is just always 90% full.",28,"Sony"

No slow downs. No freeze ups. No battery problems. I always had a feeling Apple was slowing down their phones and the truth just came to light recently. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a Apple or Samsung hater. In fact I was a big Apple fan back in 2007 when they released the Iphone. And I was a Samsung Galaxy fan also. I had the Galaxy 1 , Galaxy 2, and Galaxy 8 Edge. But after a while just got tired of their little upgrades here and there every year. And they both charge and arm and a leg for their flagship phones. So I went to Sony XA Ultra. This phone was fast on booth up, fast on apps , great camera. Beautiful phone in white. Sony had the AR effect on my phone already. And apple just came out with it on the Iphone 8 or is it the Iphone X recently . That is a joke . All in All great phone.

I thought that this would easily be overcome if I simply got a large external SD card, which I fitted. The SD card is great for things like music and other mass-storage media, but the phone heavily restricts what you can transfer to the card in the way of apps. What this means is that you are seriously restricted in terms of apps that you can download and enjoy, and with the ever-increasing size of essential app updates, you end up playing this almost daily routine of clearing cache and deleting apps that you'd like, but cannot have.

"147","B01FJT7E3M",4,"true","I purchased the Sony Xperia XA Ultra and I have been using it for several months now. There are many pros and cons to the device. I will list the pros first and then the cons. Pros: Screen size. Watching videos is amazing on the large display. Battery life. The battery last all day for me with heavy use. I use it to play games and watch videos. I get up at 4:30 am and by the time I'm home at 4:00 pm the battery is still at 70 percent. I'll charge it before bed and it will barely be at 25 percent. Some games do drain the battery and heavy use will do that. Sleek design. This is a beautiful phone. The design is sleek and thin. I hate needing to have it in a case. I don't want to drop it and ruin it. Software. Bloat ware. This phone really doesn't have any. Just the usual Google Apps. Some Sony apps. Games. You can play any game on here perfectly. The processor is great for it and the screen makes it better. Android pay is available. I like it but not many places support android pay. Cons. Sony did not make it water resistant. There are not many cases for it. No otterbox cases. This is mostly because Sony dell's their phones unlocked so the third party case makers are busy making iPhone cases. No remote play for the ps4 or ps3. Hard to pair the ps4 controller to it. It is possible to pair it but I could only get my blue ps4 controller to pair. The controller the ps4 came with did not pair well. Memory. It only has 16 gigs but after 5 gigs of apps you only get 10 gigs to play with. You can add a micro SD card which works great but you cannot download to it directly. Android makes it so you have to download it to the phone first. All in all this is a great phone.",6,"Sony"

This is one of the few devices that offer a flash for the frontal cam furthermore apps run very smoothly and it's a pretty fast phone very little wait time for loading pages etc and easily handles running multiple applications. Is user friendly very easy to use the only real down side to this phone is that it has a small battery for the size of the phone and drains quickly when below 30% streaming video or playing games.

However, after a few months, I notice there is a delay between when you take the pic, the image produced, and when the camera will be ready to take another pic... This sucks when you ask someone to tk 2 pics back to back for you and now they have to wait with the spinning wheel for the cam to recoil. The phone comes loaded up with way too many Sony apps one must disable. When you try to send video texts there always seems to be problem; often says file is too large no matter what the size. I didnt have this prob before this phone; I had to download another app to get around that problem. For whatever reason the screen is really bright and adjustment through settings does not help as much as one wld expect.I also get intermittent trouble with Bluetooth functions.... Some devices it just doesn't pick up they way for example my Samsung Galaxy wld or it may disconnect. Also, the phone in my opinion is a little heavier than comparably sized phones.

Lemon) color is a warning...but these are not issues with this unit. This model, which has so much potential, simply does not have its potential filled. GPS? unreliable. Not by much, but enough to miss a turn here and there. No tap to wake up or lock phone, which is a feature that should be in every Android 6 phone. Turn off screen with case? Not implemented yet, even though Sony sells (in the UK) a case that does that. Security update of May 1st (there have been three updates since then, and this is a new device!). These are all software issues, that should have been taken care of already (there was a software update). I hope that the promised update to Android 7 will be quick and solve these issues. Battery life? Two days, of calls, texts and very limited web access. Use Google Maps, and you will see drain of 20% in an hour. Pokemon Go will drain the battery in an hour or so, and constantly complains about losing GPS and internet (which it then reacquires in a few seconds). Internal storage of 16GB should have been fine with the additional microSD, if only Sony would have allowed its apps to be removed (or at least moved to the card) and the big cache users put their caches on the card. As it currently stands, my phone has 3GB free and I need to be careful of which apps to install. Should have beed 32GB. I have not used the cameras much, so I cannot really say anything about them that other reviews . On the bright side, the screen is beautiful, and the phone very narrow (relative to other 5.5"" and 6"" phones), which makes it easy to hold and use.",5,"Sony"

"167","B01FJT7E3M",4,"true","The good: The phone is a huge improvement over my 3 year old HTC One M8. It does everything I need a phone for, including actually making calls. I've had no connectivity or battery issues, it came up instantly on the AT&T network, and I've been impressed with the screen and overall responsiveness. The not so good: This phone has hit the floor more often in the week that I've owned it than all of my other phones combined. There are several contributing factors, including the size, the almost frictionless back, and the tendency to get buried under various objects on my desk while connected to headphones, leading me to forget about and fling it off into space when moving. The last drop was catastrophic- directly face down onto a bathroom tile floor, and the front glass shattered. This is the first time I've ever damaged a phone in such a fashion, and it was a mildly traumatic experience. Yes, first world problems, I know. The irony of the situation is that the protective case I ordered for the phone arrives today. Unfortunately, the glass and the touch screen are integral to one another, and I was quoted a price of over 200 dollars to repair. Bummer. Hence the title of this review- seriously, don't start using this phone without a case unless you live in a completely carpeted world, or never, ever take your phone into a room with hard tile floors, or probably, even outside.",4,"Sony"

I am not very technically savvy or demanding, so my criteria for the phone were as follows: - Price. I wanted to stay below $300, but the cheaper - the better. - Screen. I browse internet on the phone and text a lot and wanted at least a 5 and a half inches screen. - Camera. I take lots of pictures of my kids with my phone and wanted a decent quality camera. In short, this phone got it all perfectly. The screen is amazing, big and vivid. As always with Sony products. The pictures are great. I purchased a 128G microSD card ($40 Samsung card on amazon) and it gives me plenty of the space to store my pictures. The calls and messages (including MMS) work just as they should, no problems so far (I have PureTalk USA which is an AT&T company). Battery life is acceptable, similar to my old xperia. That is, easily gets me through a day even with intense calling or internet browsing. I do wish that it had a finger print sensor, and I don't like all the bloatware from Sony which can't be uninstalled (only deactivated). Nonetheless, for $300, this phone is a steal. I've only had it for a few days so far but I sure hope that it keeps working for years to come, just as my old xperia did. Highly recommend.",6,"Sony"

The screen is beautiful, but it's a large phone--and the volume button is placed exactly where your hand lands no matter how you hold it. I keep missing calls and texts because the volume has shut down accidentally. I also miss the tactile nature of the iPhone Home button and the slider button for turning the whole thing on and off. Update Aug 2017: Downgraded from two stars to one, as the speaker stopped working almost entirely. Nothing on speaker, and nothing louder than a faint whisper on earpiece. Fine when playing media but useless for phone calls or checking voicemail. It's pretty bad when a phone doesn't work as a phone. I've spent hours trying to fix, to no avail.

"188","B01FJT7E3M",4,"true","This is a review comparing this phone to the HTC Desire Eye, on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. I got this phone with the Sony MicroSD 64GB deal for $306 ish after tax & free one-day shipping. Amazon told me I'd get it by the 15th, but it literally came next day, so hands off to you, Amazon. Screen : yes, it is extremely bigger than the HTC, by a whole .8 inches; the keyboard felt so much better on the Xperia XA Ultra, but that's just because my fingers had the space to press the right key. BUT quality wise, I was not impressed when I had my HTC right next to the Xperia. Fooled me, my HTC had a brighter and more clear colorful screen, even with the stock Xperia wallpaper applied. Camera : Oh boy, I was sad the minute it was opened. Colors were washed out in normal sunlit rooms, no way to save preferred options on top of the Superior Auto, and biggest difference between the HTC stock camera was the selfie front camera had no way to beautify in-app. I would have to download a separate app ): Nor was the front camera even clear; the focus on my HTC was superior. This was the deal breaker for me. Speed : Camera shutter speed was the same, camera start up speed was the same, picture processing after capture is slower on xperia, opening apps on the same wifi network was the same, opening apps on data plan was same, download speeds the same wifi and data wise, start up from power down was slower on the Xperia. Interface : Though I am used to HTC Sense Home layout, the Sony UI was not hard to navigate through, I found everything I needed quick or with some fast reading. I mean, the Sony one stuck with the notification drop down menu from vanilla Android, which was a nice difference to look at. But HTC could fit and has more options for the settings in the drop down, such as an extra row at the bottom for 12 options rather than just 9. You'd think you can fit more on a bigger screen, but Sony just didn't program it to utilize it that way. Shrugs. Two software updates straight out of the box, though the first was a quick update, but the second took a little longer to boot. Is okay, slight overheat in first start up and set up, but that's normal for any phone. But my concern is that the heat was above in the top right corner where the camera ans not where your hand usually holds the phone, so if it does overheat again, how would you know... ): No gyroscope, so don't believe that one answer on BestBuy's product page. (This means Pokemon Go suffers, & my HTC has gyro, shrugs.) Did not come with adaptive storage enabled, so I would have to program it to do so, when my HTC just required a fast enough SD to do so (UHS-3 minimum, which is not cheap, but least likely to give me hiccups). Vibration was extremely easy to feel, which was pleasant, because it was strong enough to feel, but not too strong that the phone moves on a table surface. Speakers are at the bottom, but I still heard it. My HTC has front facing speakers, so I cannot compare effectively, since front facing is already a bias. Other than that, I didn't really test anything else. Nothing on battery life, GPS, phone clarity.. Please ask any questions you have, as I will probably be able to tell you directly from my short time with it. Yes, I did return it. (:",2,"Sony"

Basically jumped through countless hoops and it still can't be used for navigation, even without a case and on windshield mount. Battery is awful, and drains within a few hours with minimal use. For storage, the phone launched with a horrendous 16 GB capacity, which after lots and LOTS of bloatware that cannot be removed, gives you 10 GB of scraps to eat, which go very quickly. The camera is worthless in low light compared with other similar phones, so there's always the pain of dealing with a daytime only phone. The screen developed a yellow tint, and flickers regularly when brightness is up. The lowest brightness setting is much too bright, which results in eye strain when doing nighttime reading.

Callers often complain my mom's voice is very very soft, to the point where they cant hear her. Sony customer support did nothing. Sony says the screen issues may be due to Wi-Fi (ha) and the soft voice issue can be temporarily fixed by rebooting the phone, but theres no permanent fix aside from downloading extra software (which my mom doesnt want to do).

"203","B01FJT7E3M",4,"true","I bought this phone the first day it came out, because I really wanted to have a big screen and my lg g5 only have a 5.3 screen, I am currently using it with cricket wireless and I get signal almost everywhere. pros: -screen alone is 5 stars, is amazing, good quality, good brightness even outside, great whites, love the edgeless design, I'm glad sony still uses lcd panels because amoled screens are prone to burn in. -phone is fast, I haven't experience any slowness or lag, everything opens really fast. -speaker sound is really nice and loud another 5 stars for it. -battery life is the same or better than my lg g5, so I cant really complain here. -call quality is good, signal is good as well cons: -only 16gb of internal memory, this is my main concern this phone deserves a least 32gb of internal memory, I downloaded a couple games and I only have 1 gb left. unfortunately you cant install apps directly to sd card. You can move some apps to sd card only if the developer allowed it, so some apps wont let you move them to the sd card. so this is a big downside. -hard to find quality cases and screen protectors -miss tap to wake a lot, I think this is one of the reasons I miss my lg g5 -miss fast charging, this is the other reason I miss my lg g5 lol. anyways this is a great phone I have no regrets on buying this phone even though I paid full price for it, the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because this phone deserved more internal storage and a bigger battery. UPDATE 1: after a flawless one week use, this last week the phone started experiencing problems. for some reason as others have said before, the cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. I noticed this only happened when enabling LTE mode on crickets (ATT's network) so unless Sony fixes this before my return period, ill keep it otherwise i will return phone. otherwise this is a fantastic device. UPDATE 2: SONY issued an update which fixed the lte dropping issue, now this phone is perfect",41,"Sony"
"204","B01FJT7E3M",1,"true","I have used this phone now for a couple of days and I think for the amount of money I paid it is a huge disappointment. Before I purchased it I was debating if the battery life is good enough or if it could be a issue. Now the battery life is the least of my concern. First off all the phone box itself was not sealed. So there is no proof that the phone is really a new phone. The WIFI issue: Whenever the WIFI area changes the phone does not connect automatically. It starts scanning for available WIFI and scans and scans... It keeps saying ""No WIFI available"" even if I stand directly next to the WIFI Router. After 30 min I usually give up and I reboot the phone. Like I said so far the phone was never able to connect automatically to a different WIFI so I always end up restarting the phone. The Transfer issue: If the phone is connected to the computer to transfer pictures, music, etc. a couple of problems may acure: -The computer is not always able to find the device -If finally connected it does not always display all folders -Sometimes if you open a folder it says Folder empty when it is not -Very often after a couple of minutes connected to the computer a message pops up saying: The device is not working anymore or it is disconnected, which is not true -Most of the time while transferring pictures to the computer it freezes. So I have constantly plug and unplug the device to the computer. Besides the major issues there are some minor issues like: -you can not change the Font -just certain things ( music, pictures, videos) are able to transfer to the sd card -you can not wake up the screen by touching it -no headphones came with the purchase of the phone Probably there are even more major and minor issues I have not discovered so far, I would definitely not recommend this phone to anyone.",5,"Sony"

That was my main problem.",1,"Sony"
"208","B01FJT7E3M",3,"true","I want badly to give this phone a better review. However, after using the Z1 and then the Z2, this phone is a bit of a let down. Sony decided to use a less expensive processor, resulting in a much lower priced phone. This is the great news and the processor seems to be very effective. The bad news is that Sony, for some reason changed some of the things, which made me rave about their phones in the past. The first thing they changed is there is no longer a magnetic charging option. Also, the USB port is not covered making this phone non-waterproof. Without the magnetic charging port, the USB port has to be used. If Sony had made this phone wireless charging compatible, the removal of the magnetic port would not be an issue. Why are so many phones wireless charging capable, but Sony cannot get onboard with this? The fact that it is rapid charging capable is a plus however, I had to purchase a rapid charger separately. Sony also removed the capability to connect to a TV via HDMI/MHL. The only way to connect and play media on a TV is via wireless means (DNLA, Bluetooth). Therefore, if the TV is not up-to-date with those technologies, you are out of luck. Bad move Sony, bad move!! The camera so far does seem to have been upgraded. I was never impressed with the camera on both my Z1 or Z2. What I am curious is if I will still have to use my Microphone STM10 at concerts in order for the sound to not be garbled?",3,"Sony"
"209","B01FJT7E3M",5,"true","This phone will not disappoint! The first thing you'll notice is the size and beauty of this phone. The sleek design along with the metal frame makes this phone an attractive one. The 6"" full HD screen delivers sharp and clear picture which is perfect for watching videos or flipping through pictures. The sides of the screen curve right into the edges seamlessly which is pleasing to the eye. The front-facing camera is incredible. It even has flash for selfies taken in low-light conditions. Rear-facing camera is no slouch either. The speaker is as loud as most smartphones go but nothing too impressive. The ability to add more storage via the micro-sd card slot is a great touch since it only has about 11GB of usable storage. This phone fairs well with high-end phones and for half the price too, great value!",3,"Sony"

"213","B01FJT7E3M",1,"true","The short version: it's pretty bad. Here are the issues: 1. Bloatware. 2. Inability to move apps to your memory card, which results in a laughably small amount of usable space thanks to the aforementioned bloatware. 3. Sonys infuriating AVLS which cannot be turned off, adjusted, or changed in any way. 4. Inability to remove, customize, or change settings for all of the bloatware and proprietary garbage. 5. Bluetooth device button problems. 6. WiFi problems. 7. Randomly freezes or refuses to turn on. 8. Randomly bricked itself, erasing everything on it earlier this year. 9. Terrible button placement. 10. Inability to customize led color for different types of notifications. The good: 1. The cameras 2. The large screen The long version: I'm on my second phone. The first one overheated while charging after only a month and a half of use, cracking the screen near the camera. Sony support was useless. Put me on a waiting list to have my phone serviced. I've still never received a call or email. Amazon, however, stepped up immediately and was kind enough to replace the phone. So I set up the second phone, and go through all of the updates (which took about two hours). Everything seems to be fine. I get to work, where I listen to my bluetooth headset the entire shift to drown out the awful music they pipe through the building. Bluetooth connects, no big deal. Turn the volume up, and it stops at about 65%. It's unreasonably low. There was no warning, and there is no way to bypass the limiter. So I get to spend my entire day having Motorhead and Danzig gently whispering to me while still hearing all of the noises I'm trying to drown out. I like my music fairly loud, and the manufacturer of my phone shouldn't have a say in whether or not I am allowed to do this. It turns out, there's no way to bypass this software nanny without rooting the phone and voiding my warranty. I've never done this, and the process looks very time consuming and complicated. I really shouldn't have to do all of this crap just so I can listen to music at the volume I want. What makes me the most furious is that my previous Xperia, the one that overheated, didn't have this problem. I turned the volume to whatever level I wanted. Zero issues. As far as what I like about the phone, the cameras are quite good, the screen looks good enough for me, and it's really big. But that's as far as it goes, really. More bad than good with this thing. UPDATE: A few weeks after writing this review, the volume limiter has disappeared after a random software update. Hopefully the problem doesn't show up again. Everything is working as it should. UPDATE 1/15/2018: After about two and a half months, the phone has the occasional hiccup. An app not working properly, or whatever. I usually just restart it, and it's fine. Today, I restarted the phone, and nothing. It sat on the ""Xperia"" screen for 20 minutes before I reset it again. Same thing. It just hangs out on the Xperia screen and refuses to do anything. I ""repaired"" the phone using Sony's software, Xperia Companion. The phone has finally rebooted. It completely wiped the slate. All of my photos, contacts, and apps are gone. Great. This is the latest of a huge list of problems with this letdown of a phone. Update 9/2018: The volume limiter is now randomly back, but only when connected to my new MPOW Bluetooth speaker. The volume level is obscenely low. On a camping trip last week I actually had to connect my kindle fire to the speaker, then tether it to this phone (which surprisingly works really well) just to be able to stream music at an audible volume. All of the other problems with the phone are still present. Now, in addition to those issues, this thing won't work properly with wifi. It constantly freezes up while on my home network, necessitating a restart every few hours. It now often has problems recognizing buttons on Bluetooth devices while listening to music, which also necessitates a restart. Even though my memory card is virtually empty, I'm out of space and have to delete an old app if I want to download something new. As it stands, I only have 13 downloaded apps on this thing. Nothing particularly large, either. Of course, all of Sonys impossible-to-remove bloatware is still functioning perfectly, eating up space and sending me constant notifications that can't be turned off. I'm always surprised when this phone actually does something it's supposed to do. It's that bad. When I get a new phone, I'm going to cut this one in half with my chainsaw and post the video to YouTube. My other issues with this phone are: -Cannot save most apps or download Spotify playlists to SD card. Why does this thing even have expandable storage if it's basically unusable? -Can't change the color of the notification LED (i.e. a blue LED for text, red for youtube, etc.) They all just show up as the same color. -Bluetooth, even when not connected, will drain the battery pretty quickly. -Volume rocker is in the center of the right side, which makes it difficult to use a ""clamp"" style dash mount. Thankfully the phone is so big that it can be mounted next to the rocker. -Very few aftermarket cases available. I would look elsewhere for a phone. This one just has too many problems to be worth the low price. I'm ordering something new and using this thing as a backup. I use my old LG G2 as a benchmark. It took four years and two broken screens for this phone to give me any problems at all. This goofy Sony has been nothing but problems and it's only two months old.",1,"Sony"

When I purchased the phone I knew what I was getting I checked out the specs and everything. When it arrived I was excited to get it set up and ready for use. After Updating the phone I realized that I only had 5 gigabytes left of internal phone storage which I thought was ridiculous. So there was over 10 GIGS OF UPDATES!!!! Absolutely Ridiculous. I really liked the size of the phone but that was really the only thing that stood out as far as appearance goes but lacked a finger print scanner and other features that most phones have now a days especially for this price.

Besides that, I like the display, although the lowest brightness is brighter than what I'm used to coming from a Galaxy. The flash on the front camera is nice to have, and I'd miss it. I wouldn't stare towards the front camera flash for too long since it's very bright for the eyes. And about the battery, after 5 hrs 48 min of time on, it's at 29% battery. I wasn't used to all the buttons being on the right side of the camera in the position that they're in since my palm kept bumping into the volume and camera buttons. It was less of a problem touching the camera button because the camera wouldn't be activated unless it is firmly depressed. However, slightly touching the volume button would cause the volume to adjust unintentionally. Either way, I didn't like those buttons being in the way like that.

C) Quickly linked to my PS4 and Sony XBR850 TV. The included media function turns into a remote control for the TV, great for turning off the TV when the kiddos aren't listening so well. D) The onscreen keyboard is great in landscape mode, I frequently am using it one handed. E) I can watch 4-5 hours of video on a charge. CONS: A) The ridiculously small battery drains in record time. There are a few YouTube videos than can explain how to disable all the nonessential stuff that can help save the battery life. But, you will have to be vigilant about the updates turning stuff back on. Take your charger with you if you are going to be out all day, or are constantly using the phone. B) Sony has filled this phone with bloatware (of their own) that eats up over half of the on board memory. You can't delete them. Some of the bloatware is useful, but much of it I don't use. C) Mine frequently tells me my TF card is corrupt and needs formatting. Usually a hard turn of and restart will fix the issue but other times it wont. D) It doesn't have an easy to replace battery for a hotswap like my Lumias did. E) It doesn't run on the Windows Mobile 10OS. Overall, if you want to avoid the constant upgrade cycle of the iPhone and Samsung lines, or want to avoid being locked into a contract; buy this phone. I despise the iOS and Android platforms, the former is vastly overrated and expensive, the latter is infested with Google spy tech. I disabled as much of Android functions and replaced them with the Microsoft versions, (yep they are only marginally better at not spying on you). The phone is a solid performer in the midrange / budget category that will do it's job with the typical SONY aplomb. One day in and the verdict is still out. I had to replace a Microsoft 950 I misplaced. I have been using Windows phones for years, and really hate Google so this was a tough decision to go to an android phone. Pros: Gorgeous phone overall, the six inch display is amazing. It charges quickly. It was simple to activate at AT&T. Cons: It is a good thing it charges quickly, as the battery drains fast. I haven't tried stamina mode yet. Does not come with headphones or an owners manual. The manual is download able at Sony mobile.com.Speaker is a joke and the microphone is near useless when phone is 14 inches from face. Does not sync well with MS pm, tablet, Xbox etc...

"229","B01FJT7E3M",5,"true","I'm very impressed with this phone. It is beautiful to look at, runs smooth and has an amazing screen. Some on YouTube gave this phone negative reviews on the screen and build quality - don't believe them. This phone does have some short comings - small battery and on board storage plus no fingerprint reader. Unfortunately all phones in this price range have somethings that you may not like. I wish that a phone company could combine this phone with my other phone (Xiaomi Redmi note 4). The Note 4 has amazing battery life and a fingerprint reader - what it doesn't have is a 6 inch screen, great camera and it only has 4g no LTE. So if you don't mind charging your phone every night or need a ton of internal storage (you can put a 200gb SD card on this phone) Buy It. Update: I'm a little disappointed with the camera. All the reviews raved about how good it's camera is. I've taken pictures with it and they look a little fuzzy even in good light. My 45 dollar Huawei Ascend xt2 actually takes better photos. The Huawei has a 12 mega pixel back 8 front camera while the Sony has 21 pixels and 16 back. Both cameras on the Huawei are better. The one thing with the Sony is the color reproduction is spot on, the Huawei'should is a little saturated. Maybe mine is defective, but that doesn't effect my feelings about the phone - it still is a beautiful piece equipment.",3,"Sony"

Most apps work okay, but instagram, Photoshop, facebook and other programs that require more RAM run horribly. None of the navigation buttons would work sometimes. Also the camera is pretty good at taking photos. but only outdoors. Indoors its a noisy mess. And yes, there's lag with the camera too. Often times I would take a photo or two, and then I'll check my photo app, there's no photos there. Like where did it go Sony? Oh yeah, lag. Even though there's 3 gb of ram, the CPU is so old and slow, nothing gets done. My old Moto G4 had none of these problems and it had 2gb of ram and a similar CPU.

"240","B01FJT7E3M",2,"false","Basic information: Time with phone: 3 months Prior phone: Huawei Mate 7 Other brands of phones tried: Samsung, HTC, Huawei, iPhone Background: Computer engineer The overall experience with this phone was negative. I don't want to be too harsh and give it a one-star, as I'd imagine there are worse options out there at this price, but if this was more expensive (it's priced at the lower range of Xperia devices) it would have landed in the uno-star category without a doubt. Since this is a negative review, I'll start with first the major gripes, then some minor flaws and perhaps, if there are, any redeeming factors. Major gripe #1: The OS is atrocious. From what I've read, Sony sticks fairly close to the stock Android OS, so how it became so bad is a bit of a mystery. What did I actually experience? 1) Very long boot time, 2) a useless prompt at boot to choose languages (everytime!), 3) a failure of the phone to restart itself, and worst of all 4) laggy interface. One may think, and I certainly did, that Chinese phones would be more laden with bloatware, and an inefficient / poorly designed overlay, bogging down the Android OS. My Huawei Mate 7 which was purchased over a year ago booted much faster, and very rarely had apps freezing on me (I actually don't recall ever). The Sony was having speed issues all the time. Whatsapp was locking up, Snapchat was frozen, the list goes on. The worst part is that for some reason, it prompts me to choose my keyboard input methods every time at start up. Because of this prompt, the phone fails any restart action, as it just stays on that screen until I choose an option. The choice had no discernible effect on the actual input of the phone, as I installed my own keyboards and I never saw what I chose in the start up screen reflected in the actual operations. However, most of time, choosing Restart just turned the thing off and it wouldn't even restart. Basically performing just a shut down. My biggest mystery was that how did they manage to cause the performance of a close to stock OS to be so atrocious?? Either Sony, in its somewhat ailing state of corporation lack the resources to do something so basic correctly, or had simply went for a wrong strategy. I wouldn't even compare this phone to Samsung or iPhone, but the operations pale in comparison to my previous Huawei. Once I try to ignore this long boot time, and try to reboot as little as possible, then Sony conveniently reminds me of it by forcing me to reboot ALL THE TIME. The phone is dual sim, and any time I change data source between SIM 1 and SIM 2 I'm rebooting, every time I change voice source I'm rebooting, Sony updates, which did nothing noticeable to performance, I'm rebooting, change google accounts I'm rebooting. The amount of time lost in the loading phase of this unit is just ridiculous. Perhaps the stock Android also requires rebooting at these times, but is it not possible for Sony to have directed its efforts to nullifying this particular step instead of asking me to choose my input method at every start up? Is it really necessary to reboot when I change voice source? I don't know. Of course, I need to be watching the phone because otherwise it either does not reboot or if it does, stays on the input selection screen, and then when I realize, I'd have to choose my input for whatever reason and then have it actually reboot, which was about a 2 minute process at a minimum. Major Gripe #2: Battery. GSM Arena states that this phone has 2700mAh. I looked up my Huawei Mate 7, and it had 4100 mAh. Admittedly this phone is lighter but here is what you get as a trade off. I have seen this battery meter at 21%, and after a one hour flight, during which I had TURNED OFF the phone, it gets to 5% after I had turned it back on and walked off the plane. I then see it actually drop from 3% to 0% in one step and proceed to shut down. It was not the only time I had seen with my eyes that the meter number skip numbers and drop from 3/2% to 0%. This phone should be bundled with a battery pack, because I don't see it being anywhere useful otherwise. It is hands-down the worst battery life of any phone I've used, including the Samsung Galaxy I. Major Gripe #3: Design. The phone is supposed to look sleek with a rounded glass front and bezel-free edges. What really happens is that you are always registering a touch on the surface when you hand wraps around and rests on those rounded edges. It's simply not practical. Sometimes, to side-step this issue I have to use two fingers to pinch the edges of the phone to hold it very carefully, like a pair of calipers, in order to make one solitary press somewhere on the screen. My palms are basically always pressing somewhere on the edges and registering. Placement of the back camera is standard, but inferior to the middle placement of say Huawei and Samsung. Pretty much every time I take a picture I need to first clean the glass for a fingerprint smudge, which I did not have to with the Huawei. Front camera is recessed which means it is extra hard to clean fingerprints. All in all designed to frustrate. Major Gripe #4: buttons. First, Sony took away fingerprint sensor. I'm not sure how much this shaved off the cost, but I'm sure it added 4 keypresses and 3 seconds to every single time I had to unlock the screen. Fingerprint sensor will be standard and there is no going back. Why they went backwards with this, albeit budget, phone is inexcusable. Next and I don't consider it a major gripe because I signed up for it, is the 16GB memory. Apps cannot be installed onto an SD card, unless rooted, so I find myself constantly deleting all non critical apps to make way for new installs. I understand this is a budget unit, and the price tag is quite attractive, but 16GB is borderline unusable. Then there is the supposedly great dedicated photo shutter button. Is it great? No. it lags to oblivion and in the time I had to hold my hand up and wait for the screen to show what I want to capture, I could have just navigated there myself with screen presses. The power button, which gives the option of a ""screenshot"" when long-pressed also lags, so most of the time I am taking a screenshot of me already navigating out of said frame, and it is a picture of two apps interchanging. What are the redeeming factors? I don't consider them at all redeeming of this phone, but the thing that prevented me from giving it one-star is the price. This phone was truly cheap. It sells, at the time of writing, here at USD300, and that's a real bargain. Is it worth all the hassle? Personally, it is a resounding no, but that's up to individual preferences. For a company that has been around since SonyEricsson days, I think this level of user unfriendliness is inexcusable. It is sad because Sony makes some fantastic hardware sometimes. I have the Sony Xperia Z4 pad, and it remains as the lightest and first to be waterproof pad. The design is sleek and the weight is unbelievable. Sony phones however, are another story. The flagship model was heavy when I tried it, and at this point somehow they have bungled the UI so bad that it is greatly inferior to latecomers such as Huawei. I hope to warn and deter others of falling for this phone because the battery never lasted for a day and the OS is curiously inefficient. There are options out there, such as the Samsung A series or other 2nd-tier models and I would at the least try those out before getting this. My conclusion is that I won't be buying a Sony phone for a long time, maybe forever, as it seems they have really regressed and messed up some very basic things with this unit, which even a floundering company like HTC or a new comer like Huawei does not fail in. I simply don't want to be pulling my hair out with every reboot and every time the phone battery drains, which altogether is all the time.",NA,"Sony"

"269","B01FJT7E3M",4,"false","(August 7, 2017): Users, if want to buy the phone and stay updated about the possibility (or confirmation) of this phone's eligibility to receive the Android 8 software update, you can track the topic on Sony's online community and contribute to make your voices heard about your desire (expectation) that Sony includes the XA Ultra on the approved list of phones that will receive the Android 8 software update: https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Software-Updates/XA-and-XA-Ultra-Android-8-Update/m-p/1250152#M37065 (August 4, 2017; Update): The phone is still doing well. I'm writing to update readers that there are preliminary news online that Sony has released the list of Xperia phones that will receive Android 8.0. Sadly, this phone has not been selected for the update even though it was release on the same year as another Xperia model that has been chosen for the update. If you're happy with Android 7.0 and the price point then buying this phone is a ""no brainer"". If you're the person that must have the latest OS then this might not be the phone for you since, as of this writing, the XA Ultra is likely not getting the 8.0 update. I will post updates if the news online change. (Source: https://theleaker.com/sony-android-8-0-update-phones-list/) (July 20, 2017; Original Review): Great phone, minor annoyances. I won't get into the technical specs--there are smarter people here who have done so--but I will share general impressions and observations. I wanted a phone that stood out from the Samsung & IPhone crowds. This phone has the premium look without the premium price, especially when the newest replacement (XA1 Ultra) has hit the market and has helped to push down the price for this model. [I'm kicking myself right now because I paid $250 three weeks ago and since then the price went down by $50. Anyway, still a good buy]. The factory OS is Android 6.0 but immediately upon activation you'll be prompted to upgrade to Android 7.0. Upgrade to Android 7 before personalizing it. The OS is generally clean, meaning that Sony has limited the number of bloatware it installed. Some of the bloatware can be completely uninstalled while other apps can be deactivated. There is a way to uninstall the bloatware without rooting the phone, thus preserving the phone's warranty. If you have any level of comfort on a PC then you can easily follow the instructions online to uninstall system apps that Sony will allow to deactivate but not uninstall. Uninstalling some of the locked system apps frees up your internal memory and helps to preserve battery life. UNINSTALLING SYSTEM APPS WITHOUT ROOTING You'll need to download App Inspector from GPlay, install the ADB software on your PC and use the PC's Command Prompt to connect to the phone via USB and to type specific command lines to uninstall apps. Specific instructions have been written up online. Recognize that uninstalling some of the bloat is permanent for as long as you don't factory reset the phone. In other words, if you ever need to reset the phone to factory settings the apps that you might have uninstalled will be reinstalled after a factory reset and you will need to repeat these steps. HOW TO PRESERVE MORE BATTERY -When possible, deactivate unneeded apps. If desired, uninstall apps altogether. -For preserved apps, and selectively, turn off notifications. -Download Doze by YirgaLab. Although the phone already has a software that helps preserve battery life, I've grown to like Doze by by YirgaLab from the Play Store. Doze is more aggressive and it always works in the background unlike Sony's version that kicks in when you reach low % levels. Doze has a white list for apps that you want to exclude from running in the background such as music or map apps. -Turn off vibration when typing or for notifications. The phone has been judicious about preserving battery life. I've used the phone rather heavily and have a lot of energy to spare at the end of the day. On light-use days the phone extends the battery more impressively, I've gone 1.5 days on standby and without plugging in with adequate battery percentages. I posted a picture of the battery stamina page. ANNOYANCES There are some annoyances. These are minor but worth noting. Screen There are conflicting data sheets online about the screen's sturdiness. Some data/spec websites list this phone as having Gorilla-style glass screens that can withstand scratches. Most data/spec websites are silent on the matter or list the phone as NOT having a Gorilla-style glass screen. The jury is out on this one but I'm falling on the side of the crowd that thinks this phone does NOT have a Gorilla screen. I'm inclined to contact Sony directly (will update if I reach out to Sony). Internal Memory The internal memory is limited to 16 GB and there's no option for a 32 GB model, sadly. For the type of phone it is, it should have had at least 32 GB option (64 GB ideally) to compensate for the memory space that the OS eats up. The phone does have a Micro SD slot to expand the memory and the phone allows you to store data there to free up the internal memory for apps. Screen Protectors and Cases It is very, very difficult to find screen protectors that are highly rated. There are plenty of screen protector options but these are poorly rated across the board. The problem with screen protectors is that the phone's screen is curved on the edges. I'm guessing that the curved edges make it difficult for makers of screen protectors to mold protectors that successfully and satisfactorily adhere to the phone's screen. You might have to approach screen protector options with limited and poor reviews and consider rival online marketplaces to expand your buying options and direct-from-China deliveries until you find a (tempered glass) protector that you're happy with. It's easy to find case covers for this phone; Amazon has plenty of options.",5,"Sony"
"270","B01FJT7E3M",4,"false","I've been testing this mobile for work and it's a really great handset if you want a large screen mobile for a reasonable price. At the time of review this was running Android 6 and it has a nice, clean, Sony interface which is lovely to use. Given the massive screen it's good to see Sony have thought to add a single hand mode, which shrinks the screen into the bottom left or right corner. It's also nice to see the inclusion of a camera button, but I did find the phone didn't react as quick as I'd like when pressing the button down, so it's fortunate you can still use the on screen controls. Games run well and look good on the large screen, no chance of your hands getting in the way of the action when using on screen controls. However you will likely find your hands will muffle the sound when playing a game in portrait mode as the speaker is on the bottom. The cameras are good, this is a great mobile if you're into selfies or vlogging. And that seems to have been the focus for Sony with this mobile, a good mid range mobile that offers a large screen and good cameras, both front and back. If you've not had a large mobile before I'd recommend popping into a store to check this isn't going to be too big for you. The XA Ultra is a lovely looking device but I imagine the size isn't going to suit everybody.",3,"Sony"

"273","B01FJT7E3M",3,"false","So so. Screen is nice. Design is sleek (buy a cover right away, or I'll slip out of your hand and drop). Now to the bad part: 16GB means 5 for OS, 5 for preinstalled apps, and you're left with barely 5 for your own stuffs. Seriously Sony, preinstall Facebook? Facebook takes the most space in my phone, even more than a game. And updates fill it up even more (the preinstalled copy is still there taking precious space). How about expansion slot? Nice, but you don't want to ""move"" app there every time you updates (you know how often the apps ""update""). Android 5 has a feature of treating the SD card as internal, so you don't have to mess with all the ""moving"". But Sony just had to disable it. Don't buy this even if you're just a decent app user. There's not enough space even to update apps, and you'll be bugged to uninstall all the time. Cameras are high quality, but focus is much slower than other phones. Hate it. The moments are gone when I finally focus. The physical camera button can't be used to focus (like it's supposed to be). And if you use it as a quick way to start the camera from sleep, be prepared for the slowest, sluggish camera start up ever (my old Droid Turbo turns camera on with just a mild twist of the phone, and camera is almost instantly on, ready to shoot).",NA,"Sony"

"281","B01FJT7E3M",5,"false","After receiving the Sony XA Ultra, the reviewer decided to do a comparison. Two recently launched Sony cell phones (Summer '16) were compared in quality: the less expensive Sony XA Ultra compared with the more expensive Sony's X invites the question as to the price differential ($ 150.00), as the Sony XA Ultra is a superb cell phone with top notch audio quality (with a T Mobile account) which doubles with its six (6) inch screen as a convenient entertainment alternative. Each ran the most up-to-date Android software (Marshmallow). The XA Ultra is discernibly larger by a half inch (.5) in total screen, ""watchable"" screen and overall size of device. Camera lenses are roughly comparable; a slightly sharper ""mp"" with Sony's X (23 mp v. 21.5 mp) for the main, less in the front facing camera (13 mp v. 16 mp). The XA Ultra has image stabilization, a real plus (+) in a cell phone camera. In use, the Sony X camera shots were slightly brighter with richer coloration but this is not all that noticeable. The reviewer did not detect any color difference in the vividness of screen coloration. The XA Ultra, slightly heavier (.44 lbs. v. .28 lbs.) has a longer battery life (13.25 hrs v. 10.00 hrs), according to the manufacturer. Processors are identical, the XA Ultra has 1G more storage. Neither are water resistant. This reviewer bought a fold-over leather carrying case for protection and added a 64 g SIM card for additional storage.

The only thing that I got to say is about the camera (I'm not sure if back or front camera) but after a few minutes (flash on) it heats up really bad. About the apps, TOO MANY PRE INSTALLED APPS such as Spotify,News, Amazon, (Sony apps Sketch, movie creator,what's new,Play Station,TrackID) YouTube and FACEBOOK that you can't delete it, compared to olders Xperia. In spite of those things Im 90% happy",12,"Sony"

"298","B01FJT7E3M",5,"true","I had the Z3 and The Z Ultra. Both of those phones were flagship devices when they came out, so I thought that buying a midranger might not give me a great experience. so far i love the phone. It has band 12 for T-mobile, but no Volte, but data still works. The camera is decent in low light and great in bright daylight. The phone is not too big to hold like my Z Ultra, and has the ability to have one handed operation. The display is crisp, and 1080 p is plenty for the screens size. i have seen some trouble syncing with my chromecast to screen mirror, but that may be because there is a built in function on the xa ultra that you can sync without having the app. Sound quality is great, and the speaker is decenltly loud. I havent seen the phone be sluggish or slow, and i have about 50 apps on my phone. The white does not get dirty as some have stated. The back feels kind of glossy and it is not like my Z4 tablet, which gets very dirty. The edge to edge display is awesome and playing games and watching videos is a delight. Even N.O.V.A. 3 Ran just fine, so it should be able to play relatively every smartphone game with ease. I love this phone. I don't know what else to say.",3,"Sony"

It has a memory card slot but is pointless because you can't move most of the apps to the sd card. do not buy this phone if you're like me that likes to have a lot of apps and games in your phone, you will end up like me without any storage left for your favorites apps. i will definitely return this phone because of the lack of storage. phones these days should come with at least 32gb.",12,"Sony"

"327","B01FJT7E3M",1,"true","I bought a Sony Xperia XA Ultra on Amazon, new with a US warranty, and I am having so many problems with it. 1. I have a 10-30 second delay when initiating a call (dialing out) before it connects, even with full signal in a major city. 2. There is no WiFi calling with T-Mobile, which is a big issue especially as someone who works in a hospital where there is no signal due to all the interference from the walls, MRI's and CT scanners, but WiFi is everywhere. It seems most people buying this phone seem to be using it on T-Mobile in the United States and that is a critical feature that most other phones have, including unlocked OEM phones from other companies. Surprised it's not even an option to enable like other competitors (One Plus 3, ALL Samsung devices, Apple iPhones, etc). 3. The screen brightness isn't auto adjusting properly even with the setting for adaptive brightness being on. 4. Having the volume rocker on the right next to the power button AND the camera button is silly. They are inadvertantly hit. 5. The Mediatek CPU is kinda slow and the Wifi module onboard is significantly slower than a Qualcomm chipet. 6. No fingerprint scanner Firmware is up to date with the latest software as of 10/22/2016: BUILD: 36.0.A.2.109 Model F3213 1/5 star rating until Sony fixes the MANY MAJOR issues. UPDATE: Sony released a firmware update, and I have updated above the latest firmware for this handset. The phone STILL has ALL of the issues above, AND now has worse battery life. This phone is really a piece of crap. The only thing making me keep it is how cheap it is for the size of the screen. UPDATE 2: Sony Customer support is absolutely TERRIBLE. I have tried communicating with them in numerous ways and multiple attempts, and they have no clue how to go off script to help. Their solution is sto send in my unit (I've gone through a few replacements at this point, so it's not the ""unit"", it's piss poor engineering and software support. UPDATE 3: The phone is noticiably slower and gettigng very sluggish with only 3 weeks of use so far. Unbelievable.",21,"Sony"

With the Xperia it can be finicky as to if it wants to connect (takes a long time or you have to tell it to connect repeatedly) and frequently likes to have poor quality once it connects. For someone like me who flat out doesn't use the headphone jack having lackluster Bluetooth can be a big time frustration!

"342","B01FJT7E3M",1,"true","I have tested two separate units and the results are the same: There appears to be an LTE issue with AT&T. It just drops completely, then comes back, then drops again constantly. It does not fall back to HSPA. If you change the network mode to HSPA, it will stay connected, but if you have the Network Mode set to anything with LTE, it will drop all connectivity periodically. All APNs were correct and I even tried some older ones. I have 5 other Android phones and all of them maintain connectivity fine with the same SIM card. As a result, I didn't get to properly test the device. I processed a return on the first device and then just immediately tested the connectivity on the second device. Confirming that the issue was the same, I returned that one as well. Sony could probably fix this with a software update, if you're on AT&T, this is a no go unless you're willing to live with HSPA and change some settings.",11,"Sony"
"343","B01FJT7E3M",1,"true","The phone itself is great but the software contains a bug that drains the battery fast even while it's asleep. Apparently the bug causes the phone not to enter sleep properly and also a bug dealing with WiFi scanning. Sony is suppose to provide a fix at some point. I like the phone so much that I would like to deal with it until the update but the bug is so bad that I don't think that's possible. For example, my phone had around 55-65% left and after 8 hours of absolutely no use, the battery was completely dead. Even using temporary fixes people provide online couldn't alleviate the problem for me. I'm disappointed that I am going to have to return and look for something else because it has a great screen, takes fabulous pictures, speaker is loud but sounds a little ""tin-y"" and seems to be the perfect size I'm looking for in a phablet. The white option for this phone makes it look sick as well. The only things I would change is have the volume rocker more towards the top of the phone on the side instead of in the middle on the side, move the on/off button to the top of the phone. Moving these would make it easier to use and would make finding a car mount easier. Have a user replaceable battery, and have the phone charge faster (they advertise that it's a fast charge, but coming from a Samsung note 4, it's far from a fast charge. Might have to buy a different charger to accomplish that). And fix the battery drain bug asap. UPDATE: If anyone has purchased this phone and is dealing with the battery drain issue, I have been able to decrease the battery drain by installing the app: 360 Battery Plus and also turning off WiFi scanner in the settings menu. This seems to have made the issue more tolerable if you decide to keep the phone until Sony fixes it. Hope this helps you like it did for me.",18,"Sony"

This thing is awesome! Holy cow. I am attaching a bunch of photos for you. I have the iPhone 6Plus, and love it. BUT this phone is almost the same size with a much larger screen. The clarity is stunning. The sound is clear and crisp, and plays bass to treble clearly without distortion. It's a traditional Google phone, (my hubby is an android dude, so I am really familiar with the android os and apps). When I first powered it up, it was in need of an update, which it did without issue. The phone asked me to set it up with a pass key, but you can use a code or swipe pattern. It asked to set up with my google account, which was simple, and had an all that brought in all the previous phone data. Totally simple. I have to say it...I am very impressed. The multimedia features alone make this a better phone than my iPhone. The fun camera apps are hilarious (like snapchat). Everything works together. Facebook, email, calendar, photos...everything. Remember when iPhone came out and everyone was so happy because everything was integrated and worked well? Other androids have tried to duplicate that, and failed (in my experience) but this one is perfect. The price is amazing, too. I paid a hella lot more for my iPhone 6Plus :/ Double check that it will work with your carrier, and if it does, get this phone. You won't be sorry.",210,"Sony"

"350","B01FJT7E3M",1,"true","This is the most expensive budget phone I've bought and it sucks the worst. Bought it for $230 on sale in 2018 and started using it 4mo ago after the original battery and replacement battery on my old galaxy died. I've bought and set up a few budget phones for my dad because he breaks all electronics he touches. Got my two brothers Honor phones which were cheaper than this and works better. First off, it takes multiple swipes to unlock it. It locks back up at the drop of a hat and I can't figure something in settings that will stop it from sleeping & locking back up as soon as you're not tapping on it and no delay lock after you shut off the screen. I would be calling someone for half a minute and then as soon as I hang up it's on lockdown again. But what takes the cake is it doesn't receive calls. I probably miss half my calls because it never picks it up. And then to top it off, it doesn't ever show notifications that I have voicemail. So I could go a whole week before I have the next miss call and decide to check my voicemail and occasionally find a whole slew of them waiting for me. This phone is also a brick. It is heavy and big. I have trouble finding a pocket to fit it in and then it's a struggle to get it out of my pocket. My cell phone holder in the car unpeeled and fell off because of the weight of this thing. I swear my purse gains 5lbs after putting it in.

Playstation, never bought a laptop unless it was high-end sony. I knew this phone would be great but had no idea just how amazing it would be. The small internal storage is a bit of a pain at times, constantly having to move stuff to the SD card but once I figure out the settings, that shouldn't be a problem. it will hold up to a 200GB memory card which is plenty of space. Missing some settings that samsung has and that i had gotten use to but there's always an app you can download to fix whatever you may not like about a phone, unless you have apple then you're stuck with what you've got lol anyway. well worth the price. love the phone. must have a case though! this phone is so sleek it's slippery. only lost .3"" from the mega to this and the picture quality and video quality totally makes up for that!!!",14,"Sony"

So, it has a great camera and screen resolution. Plus, a huge screen that I'm a fan of myself. These are the ONLY reasons I'm giving it two stars. The specs are okay, but the the issue is the updates are decently large and frequent. (I've gotten three updates in the last month and a half or so.) With the frequent updates, I find myself reluctant to update as much to conserve data, but the issue is now I'm getting the ""process has stopped"" error and sometimes it doesn't go away or let me choose to shut down the system or wait to fix so your phone gets stuck there with no way to get off. Finally, I figured out pulling the Sim card out makes your phone turn off and you can turn it back on but still... ALSO, the upper left corner of my screen is off colored. Apparently that's a common issue with this phone. It isn't worth $312 in my opinion (especially because a Walmart phone is more reliable in usage.",1,"Sony"
"387","B01FJT7E3M",4,"true","I have been using this phone for almost 6 months. Like others say, it does have a few annoying issues. *texting - there is a certain phone number that always crashing the messaging app. I cant respond to those texts or receive pictures from that number. A software update fixed the problem for awhile, but it came back. The screen could certainly be more adaptive - texting is a CHORE because letters have to be pushed multiple times. *battery - with heavy usage, my battery is currently lasting about 12-14 hours before its depleted. After only 6 months, this is somewhat disappointing. *wifi - without reason or warning, sometimes the wifi refuses to work. Phone was to be shut off and reconnected multiple times before it works. *camera - OVERALL, I am very happy with the pictures it takes. ESPECIALLY low light with a stand. I took a selfie in a theatre dressing room with just the makeup lights of 7 PEOPLE and everyone is in focus, its a spectacular picture by any standards. The regular (not forward facing) camera gives me issues sometimes, especially in ""I+"" mode. It's absolutely terrible at fast moving pics, There will be multiple, blurry copies of the subject in the same pic. *size - and YES its too big. My kids say it looks like a piece of toast, lol! Too big for any pocket for sure. All that being said, I would still purchase this phone again. Especially to avoid ""leasing"" phones from carriers - it always sucks seeing ""payment 12 of 36"" on your bill.",NA,"Sony"

I had the phone opened in-person at a local repair shop and none of the water damage indicators were triggered like Sony claimed.

"393","B01FJT7E3M",4,"true","I was a iPhone 5 user, and during my trip to China this summer I used Samsung J3 and later I switched to a Sony M4 Aqua (Hongkong version, dual SIM card), that's how I started to play with Android and Sony stuff. The feeling this XA Ultra is terrific! At least my own experience on communication and light app use are good enough. Watching movie is an enjoy. But sorry I don't take photos/selfies very often, so no comments on it :-) Good news for bug fix: At least on my side, AT&T's problem is now solved. Switching between HSPA (H or H+) and LTE is smooth and not problem was detected. Maybe a bug, but might be a good thing: Battery life is scolded by a lot of users. This is not a problem for me since I often sit in offices, or commute in my car. Actually I found another problem: charging is extremely slow (or even negative, loss of percentage) with some old USB cables (I am using Amazon Basics charger and Kindle's cable). It can be a bug, or maybe it's a security concern from SONY that old or unverified chargers should be limitied. In Android 6.0.1 on other X phones there are soft charging which makes charging slower). No one wants another Samsung Note 7 incident right? BTW, charging on my car (Amazon Basics USB outlet and AB's cable is still on the normal speed as the original SONY charging kit coming with the phone. Bad thing - that's why I removed one star: Storage. SONY insist on a 16GB and no more upgrade is available. (even for the recent XZ and X Compact, they stick to 32G and no more upgrade option available). Also, Android 6.0 has a ""Format as Internal Storage"" feature which allows cellphone to treat external SD card as internal storage. I know it will sacrifice the performance because the external cards are slower, but SONY just blocks it. I know SONY wants to make sure that we can experience smooth performance. But I am not happy with that. I think SONY can provide a warning before customers eventually turns on the feature. Do not follow Apple who confines users in the name of ""so-called"" user experience.",5,"Sony"

But my screen of both phones (initial and replacement) kept having issues. The 1st phone screen would show things in pixel form then clear up to the actually image. Next, it started to show a yellowish tint on the upper left side of the screen, close to the SIM card area. So I requested a replacement. The 2nd phone, after almost a month, developed the same yellowish tint along both sides of the screen. Requested a new one but was emailed that since it was my second defective device, I would receive a full refund. I was wondering why would they do that since it has a US warranty(could just replace it) because I really liked the phone but decided it's probably best to part ways (sounds like a relationship, huh? :)",2,"Sony"

"406","B01FJT7E3M",2,"true","I had a Sony Xperia that came out a few years ago for Verizon and it was the best phone I had ever had, and when I got this one I assumed it would be the same. Honestly, the phone is just a little bit too large so it's not comfortable to hold and swipe to read things for hours at a time. Also, the screen is getting some sort of discoloration and the case itself kinda pushes in on that same side (never dropped it). These issues would be fine but the BIGGEST complaint I have is that 16GB is simply not enough and more space means spending $100+ more for the same phone. Makes no sense. Until just recently with the latest android os update,. you couldn't even put any apps at all on a SD card, limiting your space even more. The other largest issue I have with it is that the camera is just very very slow at taking photos. I don't remember my z3 ever being so slow and it seemed like it had even better quality photos. It literally takes like 5 seconds to finish taking a photo to be able to take another. Impossible to take moving photos. One minor complaint I have is that if you drag in from the corner, the entire screen will go into multi-window mode and there doesn't seem to be a way to disable that directly through the settings.",2,"Sony"

"415","B01FJT7E3M",3,"true","Before I decided to buy this phone, numerous reviews and researches had been done. Then this phone became my final choice. This is a decent phone. There are quite a few concerns online over the battery, screen resolution, and the main camera's lack of optical image stabilizer. Well, I'd like to say that after having this phone for couple of days, the only thing I don't find entirely satisfying is the main camera. Although it comes with 21.5 mega pixels, the quality of the photos really isn't any better than the main camera on the LG G3, which has 13 mega pixels. The 1920x1080p screen is great, and sometime can be rather too bright, but such problem can be taken care of by dialing the brightness down several notches. Battery wise, when it's fully charged, two 120mins movies on Netflix, 20 plus photographs taken with flash, on and off web browsing, numerous text messages exchange on two messengers, all done in the time span of 7 hours, can be sustained by the battery with still 8% left. It also doesn't take more than two hours to fully charge the battery, despite some reviews online. I have noticed that it has taken about a minute to charge a little more than 1% of the power. From 3% to 100%, the battery on my phone took about 93 minutes. Another thing is that I have watched a review on You Tube about somebody claiming that this phone doesn't allow apps to be saved on the additional memory card. Well, I have no problem transfer most of my apps on to the SD card, so just for the reference. Anyway, for a mid-range phone at this price, it is not bad. Update on Decembter 29.2016: It's been a few weeks since I started using this phone, and I have noticed several problems. 1. The SD card reader often malfunctions for no apparent reason. I had to take the card out of the slot, and reinsert again in order to get the phone to read the card again. 2. Video recording always stops on its' own within seconds after being turned on (in 1080p mode). 3. Some Sony bloat wares can not be uninstalled, or even disabled. 4. Keyboards often retract during typing. I have been dedbating whether to return this phone. While the screen resolution, built quality, and design are top notch, the functionalities are just mediocre.",11,"Sony"
"416","B01FJT7E3M",2,"true","This appears to be a closeout phone (not sure). The first one I purchased had obviously been opened prior and I returned it for exchange. Amazon supports their products (which is why I buy Amazon) and cross-shipped me a replacement. The replacement appeared to be new product, so at first I was pretty happy. But I discovered several major issues: * Difficulty in linking with my computer to transfer data. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. Never had that problem with any other phone. Reviews from other users report the same experience. It's true. * The Xperia Experience software downloadable from the site refused to run under Windows 7-- missing .dll file. So the support software was non-functional-- pretty much a deal killer right there. * When I tried to plug in a headphone or microphone, the jack was too large. I don't know whether that was a defect in this one phone or a widespread issue, but no headphone or microphone would work with this unit. * The beveled screen edges makes it near impossible to find a good screen protector. None of the manufacturers I could find molded their screen protectors to fit this phone properly (and glass/plastic is pretty easy to mold, which means the manufactures didn't want to change their process). Every screen protector on the market leaves about 1/16"" around all edges of the phone-- more than even the bevel requires. Since the screen curves very slightly, tempered glass protectors tend to pull away after a day or so. This is a major setback that is more the lazy manufacturer's fault than Sony's... but to be honest Sony didn't need to put a beveled screen on this phone. It makes it very easy to trigger the screen from the side (which is not desirable) and makes finding a good screen protector a no-go. On the pro side: great looking screen and resolution, 8 cores, very fast, nice and large. As is often the case I dislike all the bloatware, but it didn't have as much as one finds on a Samsung. I hate that new phones are coming with non-replaceable batteries-- an obvious ploy to get customers to buy a new phone every 2 years-- because lithium batteries only accept so many charges before dying, and customers aren't going to be without a cell phone while they send this in to Sony to get the battery replaced. In short, a very powerful phone with several bad features-- some of which are being shared by more phones these days. That battery issue is the ""Apple curse"". After three days examining this I filed for return and decided to stick with my reliable old phone. Don't need a new one-- because the old one has a replaceable battery and the 5.5"" screen is large enough for now. Oh, and this doesn't have a gorilla glass screen. What was Sony thinking... ""Let's save 25 cents""? That along with the fact that the first phone I received was definitely a pre-opened /used item makes me wonder what's up with that.",3,"Sony"

There are times it has become so hung up I have literally looked at the time and the sun's position in the sky to figure out if I was even roughly headed in the right direction. 2. Using voice to text is cumbersome. It takes 4 keystrokes to not have to use keystrokes. I think my iPhone needed one. 3. The buttons for turning up and down the volume are reversed. The up volume button turns it down. The down volume button on the phone turns the volume up. I'm assuming this might be a problem with my individual phone. Overall the GPS issue is so bad I probably would not purchase this phone again for myself. If you use your smartphone regularly for navigating, I would recommend something else.",2,"Sony"

"471","B01FJT7E3M",1,"true","BUYER BEWARE: If you are an AT&T service user (and that includes all re-sellers.. Cricket etc) this phone's LTE will NOT WORK. I diagnosed it to an issue of dual band towers (such as a tower that transmits both 4,17) this phone is unable to hold the LTE signal (even 200 feet from the tower) and does not just fall back to HSPA but COMPLETELY shuts down and restarts the phones radio. You will find your LTE restarting every 1-2 minutes as said by other users in this review area. This is a problem in the software and Sony's support is so poor all they do is level 1 support involving some lame recommendation to re install the phone software... (will not make a difference) or they blame it on the cell provider saying the bands are not compatible (not true). The phone works great in the areas that transmit only 1 band on the tower (such as by my home) but that is an exception to the rule for AT&T. Almost all their sites are dual band. Not sure how soon Sony plans on fixing this issue but based on the support feedback I received it will not be soon. To prove my point I ordered the previous model C5 ULTRA which is almost the exact same phone and my LTE problem went away, I am now returning this XA ULTRA to Amazon...Sad because otherwise it is an excellent phone for the $ ...Just a word of warning for purchasers of this phone, it will be an issue.",18,"Sony"

"473","B01FJT7E3M",5,"true","I'm a cell phone addict, I have played with a number of devices ranging from the Oneplus 2, Galaxy S7, and Nexus 6P over the past year. I have to say for 298 with the 64gb sd card, this was a steal. The build quality of the device is fantastic, it has NFC, and a 1080P display. The battery while not large seems to work just fine, and Stamina mode can help extend the life even further. I'm averaging about 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time which for a 2700 mah battery, 6"" display, and octacore processor is fantastic. Signal seems to be strong, and reliable, call quality is good and bluetooth works great. The cameras are solid as well I've been snapping pics of my dog. Performance is solid, while it is in fact a Mediatek P10 processor it is more than capable of handling day to day tasks and basic gaming. The screen is responsive, and clear, with good viewing angles, and is an AMOLED panel. The build quality of the phone is top notch, it feels great and balanced in your hand, and while extremely large is a smaller footprint than an iPhone 6s Plus or original Nexus 6 thanks to the bezeless sides. Only thing I wish this had is a fingerprint reader, and a tap to wake feature so I didn't always need to use the power button. Other than that I love my new device!",87,"Sony"

"479","B01FJT7E3M",1,"true","Please avoid this phone and any phone by SONY at all cost. I really try to avoid posting negative reviews on here and instead try to reach the manufacturer customer support first. What I experienced, I do not think no customer would want to go through. Just to provide a backstory, I have had Sony Z5 premium which died on October 31st suddenly. I called Sony customer care who stated there is nothing they could do. Also, it would take MORE than a month to get your device back (there is no loaner and you pay return shipping on your dime). Since I liked the clean design of SONY, I thought I would buy something I am used to and was cheap. This phone was on sale for $299 and with 6 inch display, I thought it was perfect. It is far less than perfect and I have hated every second of it. Here are the problems that I have encountered: - The screen becomes non responsive at times. You would click and it would be like Windows 98 trying to figure how to reload on like BBC News app. I think the processor they put on is poor for 2016 and future use. If that is not annoying, what really bugged me is the display screen would do ghosting. By ghosting, the screen will be frozen but you could see there some thing, like a ghost, is touching the screen. Since the screen is curved, I think the pressure makes the screen act out. The ghost touches happen on all four corners. - When you are calling someone, the call would not go through. You would see the caller dialing but it will stay static. The resolution is to drop the call and try again. God have mercy when you call through your car's bluetooth or put it on the speaker - you cannot hear the dail going out and you would not hear the person when he will pick up. You have to hang up and call again. - 16 GB's is a joke. Seriously. Because with the updates that SONY released after the phone was launched, it is actually like 10 Gb's or less. This will fill up your phone fast. I am on 7 Gb's and the phone feels like it is on its last legs with the performance. Be warned. Now the good news - Even the person won't be able to hear you, the network signal and the SAR rating on this phone is good! Where I cannot usually get a signal or a poor signal with my previous phone, this phone gets it. (T-Mobile network). The battery life is also good, which is useful for staring at the phone after it takes forever to work.",10,"Sony"

"485","B01FJT7MZC",4,"false","We got this Sony high-performance phone in black to test and review for you. We think it's an outstanding phone -- as good as any iPhone, and better than a lot of competitors. Of course, it's a Sony -- a brand known for high-quality TVs for many years, and many other electronic products. For $700, you should expect a quality communications device, and our experience is, Sony does not disappoint. This is an unlocked phone -- you will need a SIM card from your telecommunications supplier in order to be able to send and receive phone calls. You can get on that aspect before your phone actually arrives, so that when it comes from Amazon, you're ready to slip in the chip and begin making calls. This is Android-powered, a Google company, so just like your favorite tablet or maybe laptop, all the familiar apps and wifi attributes are at your fingertips. We're not going to give you an overly technical review -- there are better people to do that. Like most, we want a phone that is well constructed, is INTUITIVE to use, and is easy to hook up to your existing wifi internet and so on. This Sony Xperia feels right in the hand, has a beveled edge, a responsive touch screen, and looks good as well. You get a quick charge accessory with the phone -- plug it into USB or with the adapter, into the wall. When your phone is running low on juice, you can plug it in for a quick 10 minutes and get an additional 5-and-a-half hours of use! One of the things you're going to love is the camera -- very high quality. Actually, there are two built in. The main beast is really high def! It has a full 23 megapixels of picture quality crammed in, and is an ""intelligent"" Sony-built camera. The front-facing cam is 13 MP -- nothing to sniff at either. Another thing you'll notice, especially if you've got short arms (lol) -- the 22 mm wide angle feature lets you get everyone with you in the shot, without all your noses looking like racehorses. Now, if you're into gaming -- or just want speed -- this phone is fast! That's good enough for us -- but you may like to know that it's because of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. Did we say it's fast?? It's also super easy to set up. We've had phones that took a long time, while you twiddled your fingers. Not this one. You'll be up and going in less than 5. We think you're going to love your Sony! One thing you want to do though, before you order -- check with your plan supplier to ensure they can get you the SIM card, before you order. Recommended. ----------- Update: it's been a few months. Originally we gave the phone 5 stars, but took one off for these reasons: battery life is not great. We know it's tough to pack everything into one small package, but there it is (but at least, unlike a Samsung product -- no fire hazard!). Also, the phone freezes up sometimes and has to be rebooted. To hit the highlights again: the image is crystal clear -- 1080 hi def. Movies and videos look great! The camera function is superb. The touch screen works like a charm. The phone is ruggedly made. As a long time iPhone user, the switch to an android-based phone was intuitive and not difficult. The OS works fine.",23,"Sony"

"490","B01FJT7MZC",5,"false","My first impression upon using this phone was Holy Smokes it’s fast! Launching apps, browsing, swiping photos…anything at all just pops. My last phone was a first gen Moto X. This one is only slightly larger and about the same weight, but performance-wise it’s a huge upgrade. Display quality is excellent. Not top tier like a retina, but really, really good. The 23MP camera is among the best I’ve seen on any phone. There are a dizzying number of photo editing features too, from traditional hue and contrast options to zanier ones that stretch eyes, add lipstick or insert animated creatures. One nifty effect snaps a selfie using the front camera at the instant you take a pic using the rear camera, then inserts it as a thumbnail in the corner of the photo. Pretty neat for catching your reaction as you’re taking a memorable pic. Battery life is good. A day of use runs it to about 50%. It also has a quick charge feature that will recharge 5 hours of life to the battery within 10 minutes. Setup was easy. A wizard guides you through everything in 5 minutes. My profile and apps transferred automatically from my old phone using Google backup. You can do it via phone tap too. Sony installs a small number of apps like a weather app (which is useful) and a Playstation app (which I don’t use), but the phone isn’t overburdened with junk apps. It’s unlocked so you can use it on a variety of carriers and take it with you when you go. A great well-rounded phone. Recommended.",3,"Sony"

"520","B01FJT7MZC",5,"true","I don't know whether the Sony Xperia X Performance is a best smart phone but I know it has a best specification in terms of processor speed, screen resolution and cameras capability. Many customer reviews are unanimous in praising the phone's speed, screen sharpness and cameras IQ. But if you love listening to musics with your smart phone, this is the one for you. Just using it with a Sony High-Resolution Noise Cancellation Audio Headset MDR-NC750 and lossless sources (not just MP3) and you're in heaven. I listen to Spotify premium streams that I download into my phone for offline use with this headphone and the sound quality is almost unbelievable. The noise cancellation is so efficient that I would not recommend you to walk with this headphone in the streets without being extremely attentive to traffic. Sony does not go large and thin with the Xperia X performance as pointed out by many reviews. But it produces a well built device with elegant metal chassis that protects the cameras against accidental drops. On a thin phone the cameras often protrude, hence more easily damaged. I don't feel a need of a protective case for my phone although I covered its front with a screen protector. Once trying to put a protective case, I accidentally dropped it onto a hardwood floor without getting a dent. I have now removed the case. A complaint often raised is that Sony did not enable fingerprint on the power button. I take solace in the fact that I would not overuse the power button thanks to Sony smart wake-up: double tap on the screen wakes up the screen ready for you to swipe a security pattern to use your phone.The power button being mechanical is better not to be overused. After eight months using the phone, I am very satisfied with my purchase. Sony was also quick in updating to Android version 7 that works flawlessly for my need.",13,"Sony"
"521","B01FJT7MZC",4,"true","First, I'd like to address some questions or concerns about this phone that I have frequently seen throughout the internet. 1) This model (F8131) is not the dual sim model. If you want to use 2 sim cards, you will have to purchase the international version of the XPERIA X Performance, which is model number F8132. 2) This model (F8131) DOES have the fingerprint sensor. HOWEVER, the fingerprint sensor is disabled by Sony in the US market at the firmware level. What this means is that, the firmware for the fingerprint sensor, must be changed. You will have to flash an international firmware for the fingerprint sensor to be enabled. If you don't want to go through the lengthy process leading up to changing the firmware of this device, just buy the international version of this phone, which is model number F8132, which already has the fingerprint sensor enabled. So, in conclusion, the fingerprint sensor is not nonexistent on this model, just disabled by default by Sony in the US market. I am using this phone with a T-Mobile sim card, in the United States. I'm having no problems with connection. The phone does come with a few pre-installed apps that I wanted removed so I rooted my phone to be able to remove unnecessary apps so I'm much happier about that. Some of the apps that were pre-installed were: Spotify, Facebook, Amazon shopping, some Tetris demo game, some Spiderman demo game, and etc. Sony's stock apps on this device are: Music, Album, Video, Lifelog, PartyShare, TrackID, XperiaTransfer, and etc. I have only had this phone for a few days and haven't had time to explore the Sony apps yet, but I am interested in exploring them. This is my third Sony device. I had the Sony ZR and the Sony XA Ultra (HUGE phone *LoL*). I now have this phone. Make sure you get a case for this phone. The surface of this phone is very smooth and can easily slip out of your hand. I don't often buy cases for my phones, but this phone makes me a little afraid of dropping it due to the smooth surface. I just ordered this case: https://www.amazon.com/Performance-Ringke-Protection-Absorption-Technology/dp/B01HBWIPSI/ref=sr_1_62?m=A8YCUEQIOX5AP&s=wireless&srs=5811452011&ie=UTF8&qid=1493039145&sr=1-62&refinements=p_89%3ARingke%2Cp_n_feature_ten_browse-bin%3A11043312011%2Cp_6%3AA8YCUEQIOX5AP and a beautiful gold mirror case on another website. The lime gold color of this phone in Amazon's photo is off from the actual phone color. In person, the lime gold is more like a soft gold with a hint of lime. A slight disappointment, but nothing to make me return this phone. I only gave this phone 4 stars because I have only had it for a few days so not enough time to fully evaluate it, but so far, I have not had any problems. I've uploaded some pictures and sorry about the picture quality in advance. For the technically advanced, I've uploaded an image showing the kernel version, baseband version, and build number. I've unlocked my bootloader, rooted my phone, installed/flashed the kernel that you see in the image, and I installed a Latin America firmware on this phone which has enabled the fingerprint sensor. I have TWRP recovery in which I used to flash the kernel and SuperSU. I hope this information helps someone! ---------------------------------------------------- UPDATE (4-25-17): The battery life is great. I ran a small test. I went all day, on the 24th, without charging the battery. I browsed the internet, watched multiple videos, downloaded large files, left Wi-Fi and cell data on all day, and left quite a bit of apps running. On the 25th, I still have about half of my battery left to use. I am impressed so far. I've uploaded an image showing how much time I have left to use up the battery life, and this is without any of the Sony's battery management features enabled or any other battery management app. In the real world, I personally wouldn't be doing all of those things on my phone simultaneously, but it was a nice test that ensures me that the battery can handle multiple tasks without being drained extensively AND without running hot. However, if you are one who likes to play intense games on your phone for an extended period of time, I don't know how well the battery will hold up, but Sony does have battery management features on this phone to help extend the life of the battery. The battery is great so far and I've no problems with it.",52,"Sony"
"522","B01FJT7MZC",5,"true","Let me preface this review by stating I caught this on an amazing sale - brand new, only $269. At the time of purchase, this was without a doubt the best cell phone available in it's price range. We're talking about flagship specs (Snapdragon 820, 3GB RAM, 23MP camera, Qualcomm QC, finger print scanner (more on that), carrier unlocked) for less than $300. I love the overall appearance, especially the camera being flush with the back of the phone (the last phone I had that included a flush camera was the iPhone 5S). It definitely has a premium feel when you handle the phone. The display is crisp and bright. I've not encountered any problems using it, even in full sunlight. You might be in for a shock if you use in in complete darkness and have the display turned all the way up! Color reproduction seems to be accurate and there are two modes available to tweak contrast and color reproduction (X-reality for mobile and Super-vivid mode). I don't take a lot of photos, but the ones I've taken have been very high quality. The buttons on the camera are setup so that when the phone is rotated the zoom in/out and snap buttons are where you'd normally find them on a standard camera. If you take a lot of photos you'll appreciate the button placement. My favorite feature about this phone is the software - its basically running stock Android! In fact, I think this phone is closer to stock Android than my Moto X Pure Edition. The included launcher, Xperia Home, works exactly like the Google Now launcher, but it has more configuration options (like being able to change icon grid size). Sony also has an open beta program for Xperia Home, so check it out if you want to have access to the most current features available. I've also been very impressed with the speed in which updates are released. In the time I've had it I've received several updates, both for Android and security updates, and as of this writing the phone is on 7.1.1 with the August security update. My only knock against the phone was lack of fingerprint scanner in US markets. However, I was able to remedy this by flashing the UK firmware on my US phone. I was a little worried that it might affect access to cellular bands or cause problems with future updates, but I'm happy to report that this has not been the case. As far as I can tell the only difference is that instead of LTE and 5 bars in the signal strength meter, it shows 4G+ and 4 bars. Once the fingerprint scanner was activated I found it to be fast and accurate. As I mentioned earlier, I used to have a Moto X Pure Edition. Unlike that phone, I've not encountered any issues when trying to use Qualcomm QC devices. So far every device I've tested has been able to quickcharge my phone without problem. Overall, I've been extremely happy with this device. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a GSM carrier unlocked phone, especially if you can find it for under $300.",2,"Sony"

"527","B01FJT7MZC",5,"false","Sony does not have a big foothold in the USA mobile market so I was very eager to try this top of the line Sony android phone. I have to admit that I am a bit of a phone nerd. I own multiple phones including the flagship Samsung Galaxy S7 and the flagship HTC 10. Both are very good phones. After putting the sony through it's paces I have to say the Sony performs just as well as both the S7 and HTC 10. They all have the same processor and are blazing fast. I actually prefer the Sony skinned UI of android better than both the Samsung and HTC. The Sony UI is very light and runs very smoothly. It's similar to stock android in many ways. It is blazing fast with the snapdragon 820 processor and I have never noticed a slow down even with multiple applications open. One place where the Sony shines is in the build quality. This thing is really a beautiful phone. The brushed metal back looks really classy and all the seams and buttons are tight as they should be. Very well put together. I really think this is the classiest looking phone on the market. It might not be the smallest footprint size but it definitely is a looker. Camera wise the Sony X Performance holds it's own with both the S7 and HTC 10. The Sony is actually better at capturing fast motion due to the tracking anticipation it uses. I recently saw that a respected mobile phone camera comparison site (doxmark?) gave the Sony the same score as the Samsung S7 and they tied for top camera on a phone. I love the camera shutter button on the Sony. I wish other manufacturers did this. Overall this phone is pretty incredible. If you require a fingerprint sensor then you may need to look elsewhere as this doesn't have one but other than that this phone can hang with the big boys of cell phones. Definitely recommended.",1,"Sony"

I've updated it at least 12 times and I've had to charge it from 0% at least 6 times in 4 days - and that's with minimal use like me being at work. I also got this phone for the camera because my last sony phone had a great camera and it's worse than my note 5 camera which is what I was going to replace with this phone.

Initially when setting up the phone, Sony android devices have to go in order of every Android update(They can't just jump to the most recent update). Because of this I had to update the phone maybe 15-20 times that I lost count. But overall the update process took a good 5 hours. 2 small things that I would nag about this phone is that, when I turn of data while I travel in a foreign country I keep getting a persistent notification that says that the mobile data is turned off. And there is no way to turn off this notification. Another complaint is battery power management, coming from Samsung Galaxy Phones, I find that this Sony phone is not as power efficient.

"548","B01FJT7MZC",5,"true","I had read a LOT of phone reviews before settling on the Xperia X Performance & I feel I chose well. PROS * Camera: Great camera! The colors are incredible & I've found the camera's focus to be excellent. It takes about 2 seconds to fully launch the camera from sleep, which for me is pretty great. Video is excellent as well & while it isn't supported out of the box, there is a way to enable 4K video on this phone. I'm not sure why they chose to disable it, but you can re-enable it & it looks great. * Performance: 3GB of RAM & a Snapdragon 820, it runs great! I've run high-end games, streaming video, browsed media-heavy pages, edited 1K+ row spreadsheets in Google Sheets & MS Excel, all a what I'd consider to be extremely impressive speeds. I've read reviews to the contrary, but this hasn't been my experience. * Design: Aesthetics are 'meh' but the form factor is nice. A bit of a smaller screen/phone than I'm used to. However, I should note I'm 6'2 & 240lbs so my wife has suggested maybe the phone isn't small to everyone. I'm also used to a near phablet screen, so there's that. * Screen: The display is sharp, great colors. * Battery: Battery is middle-of-the-road, I'd say. I don't know if the OS/hardware has some kind of heuristic learning? The first day the battery dropped really fast, even if idle. The more I use it, however, it seems the more that isn't the case. I've had the phone about a week & a day of calls, email & gaming only get me down to about 73%. Idle works really well now too - would be interested to CONS * Cooling: I shot video of my kids playing outside in the pool this weekend. It was about 82 F & I'd only been shooting outside for maybe 5 minutes when the phone gave me a warning the temperature was rising, & if it continued to do so it would auto-shut off. The phone was pretty hot, but I'm not sure how much was the case I have for it vs the environment + video recording. I haven't had any problems recording indoors for long periods of time, so I will try again w/o the case & update my review. * Design: The screen bevels just a little bit. It doesn't hurt the display at all, but I note it as a negative because this could be a problem if you drop it. On the cases I bought, it looks like the glass may bevel enough to stick out more than the case if dropped, which would result in a busted screen. NOTE: I should note that my previous phone was an Alcatel Idol 4. Some of the reviews I had read about the Xperia said that the reviewer thought their phone took better pics, even at a lower resolution. That might be true, results are subjective is my point. I upgraded from a junk phone to this. If you already own an iPhone 6 or something, you may not be as impressed as I have been.",4,"Sony"

"551","B01FJT7MZC",4,"true","I want to ammend my rather lukewarm review, after using this phone for a long while, and using another very well reviewed android phone (and my wife's iphone). Sony in general makes excellent Android phones. Sony ususally dots their ""i""s and crosses their ""t""s when it comes to phone design. In other words, the engineering is usually excellent down to the very small details, with some exceptions on some models. You don't realize this until you start using another manufacturer's phone, and find out some aspect of the phone design irritates you or bugs you and there's nothing to be done about it. I wish I could be more specific, but phones have become so complex and new models come out so often... Sony does have one problem in that they have too many models which don't improve on the previous ones much. Sony phones really depreciate because of this. However, this phone in particular, and Sony phones in general, function very predictably, you can count on them day in and out. Once you get a good Sony Android phone, it is very hard to go back to another manufacturer.I can't do it. I bought a $600 phone (very well reviewed) and I just can't warm up to it, there are small omissions and errors in the user interface and a few other aspects that ruin the phone's functionality. So I'm buying my 4th Sony phone. In this particular model, if you can get it at a good price, do it. ------------------------------------------- Compared to a Xperia z3 plus which I have as a backup, it is interesting how this phone (xperia x performance) does not represent much improvement. 1) Battery life is no better or even slightly worse than the z3 plus. In other words, battery life is on the bad end of the scale. You will only get 2 day battery life if you barely use the phone. And I am an experienced Android user, so I know how to disable apps, use Marshmallow, etc. etc. Believe me (as Donald Trump says) the battery life on this phone is BAD. 2) Display is no better than on the z3 plus. The x performance is much brighter and may be slightly sharper, but at equivalent brightness levels, there is no real difference (the z3 plus has to be turned up higher on the slider to match the brightness of the x performance). HOWEVER, the z3 plus is a 5.2 inch screen whereas the x performance is a 5 inch screen, so in this regard the z3 plus is better. You would think you'd pay a penalty in phone size, but actually the z3 plus is only slightly larger (hxw and this is hardly noticeable) and is actually lighter weight and thinner. Plus the white balance of the x performance had to be adjusted (RGB in the settings). 3. Speed. Yes the x performance is perhaps subjectively 10 percent faster but no more. The heating issues of the z3 plus are largely solved and both phones heat up when the camera is used. Perhaps the z3 plus heats up a more, but both have heating issues when using the camera. I can only imagine that the standard xperia x is not even as fast as the z3 plus 4. Camera. Both are 20 mp cameras, but the x performance camera has more options and somewhat better image quality. 5. Speakers. Here the x performance has much better audio because of the front facing speakers. Voices are especially coherent, with good high frequency reproduction. Vast advantage to the x performance. 4. Construction. I never had a problem with all glass construction and the plastic side panels and aluminum back of the x, at least to me, do not represent an improvement. I should have listened to the professional reviews and not bought this phone. I should not have thrown away the box or else I would return it. It is not a bad phone obviously, but is hardly an improvement over a Sony phone which is 2-3 generations old.",12,"Sony"

"553","B01FJT7MZC",4,"false","The Sony Xperia X Performance is a great choice if you want a powerful, full-featured but don’t want to carry around a huge tablet-sized smartphone. I’ve used this phone in lieu of my trusted iPhone 6s for about 5 days and will try to provide some 1:1 comparisons: Phone Size, Screen and Case Material: The Xperia is much more compact compared to most Android tablets on the market, yet the screen is still very crisp and bright. I don’t feel a major loss in resolution compared to a larger sized screen. The metal finish is attractive but I am still partial to the “seamless” look and feel of the Apple devices personally. That being said, the phone does feel very solid and high quality in its construction. The finish and glass screen seem durable, yet the curved glass may make it difficult for a screen protect to stay put. Performance: The Snapdragon 820 is a highly rated processor and seems to run this phone quite nicely. I am less partial to the Sony launcher and apps compared to Samsung and HTC, but that’s a personal preference. The posted 3GB of RAM seem to be adequate and the battery life is also very excellent and on par with my iPhone 6S. Audio: Unlike iOS based iPhones, you gain a lot of flexibility with the Xperia in both apps and expandability. The micro SD slot can accommodate another 200gb of storage. Alongside the music player, which can accommodate lossless audio files (i.e. FLAC), you have a really amazing MP3 player. Camera and Display: The heart and soul of this camera is Sony’s amazing 23MP rear and 18MP front cameras. As expected (being a Sony camera enthusiast), they provide amazing photos in a variety of settings and are certainly a huge selling point for this particular model. A few features I didn’t like: Full app/notification customization (you won’t be able to turn off OS integrated ads easily) Lack of Fingerprint scanner",2,"Sony"

"566","B01FJT7MZC",4,"true","Had read about and wanted a Sony phone for many years. Finally purchased one as my old Galaxy S4 Active started overheating and crashing. At first glance when I opened the phone box, the phone looked really sleek and nice. A major down side that I noticed was all the buttons for this phone are on one side. This causes issues with hitting volume or even the camera button when simply trying to power down or turn the screen on. They are also awkwardly placed, power being in the directly middle and volumes being only about an inch or so underneath. Much preferred my old Android phones setup of power 3/4 up the right side and volume being on left. As for the camera button, really not necessary for a phone based around being powerful. Advertises a great camera, the quality is a far improvement over my old phone, but simple features such as focusing are pretty bad compared to older phones. It has absolutely no micro focusing, anything closer than about a foot and it is really blurry. The front facing camera is really good at least. The UI on this phone took a bit of adjusting as it was a pretty big change, going from JellyBean to Marshmallow. It is much, much faster than my old phone by a long shot. The point my old phone was at, I could not even use the phone while apps were updating, it lagged my phone to no end. With this phone, updating apps and using other apps was like slicing butter with a hot knife. Another strange thing to me with this phone was going from sim to micro-sim. Had no clue there were different sim types before this, wasnt a big issue, went to the nearest AT&T store, got the new sim and activated the phone. The biggest downside I ran into is that I purchased this phone for use in the U.S. These phones from what I've read are notoriously bad in the U.S. From the moment I activated this phone back in November to this day, I have NEVER received any service over H+ on AT&T network. I am either on H+ or E, so my service is always very, very slow. It also loses signal with the towers every 5 minutes or so, so if I ever have anything important it may be a problem. I am normally always around areas with wifi, so there hasnt been any major concern with that. If you are from a country where this phone receives better support, such as most EU countries or Japan, then this phone will work far better for you. It is definitely a powerful phone, so I'm not complaining too much, but for the service it receives and some of the other quirks, this phone series could use some better support and features. It was by no means a regretful purchase, I really do like the phone, but I may be sticking to Samsung once this phone runs its course, which for me is generally about 3-4 years as I am very good about not dropping or bending my phone.",8,"Sony"

Android runs smoothly on it and the lock screen and everything is really nice looking and different where people notice (I really like the stacked time). The phone is super powerful and plays games, netflix, pandora and all apps with no problem. Google Maps and Strava work great and with this phone's great battery lasts me beyond the whole day even when using this heavily. The phone's battery is amazing and lasts beyond the whole day. In fact never ended the day with less than 30%; and I do a lot of Pandora, Strava and Google Maps which are pretty big battery drainers. This phone is also apparently very waterproof IP68; but I am not going to take my chances. I still would put it in a Lifeproof case or seal bag before taking it in the water. Even then I never intend to go under water; but that is just me. But I do like not having to be crazy worried. The Sony UI is nice, but I really like Google Now, so I switched the Launcher to Google Now which I really like and I already use for my other Android devices; and I really like the Cards for quick glance on commute and stuff. So I just like it better. But the Sony UI was really nice and is better than Samsung's in my opinion. The camera is amazing and the soft camera button is nice for feeling like I am using a real camera; the pictures come out great and look amazing. For normal pictures it is on par with the iPhone 6S Plus; but for low light and other oddities it outdoes the iPhone; which is pretty nice (I consider the iPhone to have about the best camera in smartphones usually). This phone is missing a fingerprint reader, which is something I found really nice and useful. That is probably my only complaint with this device is the missing fingerprint reader. Since using a pattern seems really old school now. My only other flaw is that the mic and speaker on the front make the phone look almost identical from top and bottom, so I have frequently pulled the device out in the wrong direction to use. But that is not a giant problem; but a slight overlook. In the end I really like this phone. For an unlocked GSM phone I can use Net10's $40 Family plan which works great for me.

"579","B01FJT7MZC",5,"false","It's a shame people in the US don't really hear about Sony phones. On a recent trip to Japan, I was surprised to find how many people there use a Sony. Fortunately for people like me, Sony phones are sold at a fraction of a price of those ""flagships"" that are more well-known, for flagship specs. I don't review specs because you can do a detailed comparison to find what you need, but the RAM, processor, and space given on the X Performance is more than enough for most people. In terms of real usage, I am for the most part content. 1) Speed: very quick to respond, I have been using the phone for ~2 months and never notice any lag. This is expected given the new(ish) processor and RAM. Very noticeable when launching apps that require a lot of memory like Maps (one reason I had to ditch my Moto G 3rd gen even though it was adequate for most of my daily needs, ie. no gaming). 2) Fingerprint sensor: No problem at all, very responsive, can register up to 10 fingerprints so you can allow trusted contacts to unlock your phone as well. I have the non-US version, and I recommend that you buy the same. I am located in the US with T-mobile and have absolutely 0 problem with the international version, AND I get a nice fingerprint sensor. Due to completely logistics issues, I can't see Sony being able to secure a fingerprint sensor license in the US, and that's a shame. 3) Camera: this is one of the reasons I chose to upgrade from a Moto G to the X Performance, and boy is it better and flagship-worthy. I actually feel comfortable sharing the pics I've taken on this phone with others! I own several standalone cameras, and as a photographic equipment no phone can ever match a decent standalone, but for most daily usage, it comes pretty close. I've attached several photos I've taken with the X Performance here, including some in low light, unfiltered and unedited. What I dislike the post is the green hue tends to be distorted, and using the flash at night might backfire depending on the type of case you're using. All in all, very happy with the camera, including its low light performance. If you don't have to have a standalone camera and just want a day-to-day snapping tool, more than adequate. 4) Battery life: Put on full battery mode, the phone does not last me a full day of high usage, which I found to be disappointing. However, put on stamina mode (restricting scrolling, but overall I find that negligible, and I don't really notice a difference at all), you can go through a full day with web browsing, picture taking, navigation, without a problem. You can either turn on stamina mode all the time, or set to go into stamina when the battery goes below a certain point (customizable). The phone also looks very sleek, and you know you're holding a high-end product. And not to mention, water resistant and dust proof. You just need to compare the price you can acquire a high-end Sony against other flagship phones specs, and you can see why it makes so much sense to buy a Sony. Sure, you won't be getting Android updates as quickly, but neither does anybody else with a phone other than Pixel (and even Pixel has their expiration date where they won't be getting updates any more). For <$400, it's unbelievable and a steal. Again, I don't believe in getting phones >$400 either, but if I can get something this good for this price, why the heck not?",7,"Sony"
"580","B01FJT7MZC",2,"true","I thought the phone was great at first... I updated it twice the first night. I've now been using it for about 2 weeks and it has done 8 system updates in two days, and it's still asking to do another. I'm about ready to smash the damn thing!",NA,"Sony"
"581","B01FJT7MZC",5,"false","This is wonderful!!! I can't believe how crisp the screen is. The phone feels like a sports car.... very smooth and curvy. So where do I start???... The five inch display is very bright with brilliant colors. On the lock screen you can display ICE (in case of emergency) numbers and enable it to call those contacts without having to unlock the phone. You can also display medical information as well as your name on it.... if you are hurt or unconscious paramedics can have great info available if they check out your phone... and the beauty of it is you program exactly what you want available without the phone needing to be unlocked. The phone case is seamless. And quite impressive looking. Easy to hold. Though I have to say I was surprised that the volume buttons are not where you would normally find them. They are on the bottom of the side. Strange, huh? But in using it, I liked it. I didn't have any issues using them and actually found them a good option. The audio is quite crisp and if you have a noise-canceling headset the phone actually works in tandem with it to produce a very nice sound. Impressive. The camera is excellent...better than excellent. It has a 23MP main camera and a 13 MP one in front ... swapping is super easy... you just swipe. No need to hit anything. The camera can be accessed with the phone locked. And the pictures are superb. You have lots of settings to choose and options to edit your photos. I took some from a plane today and I was amazed when I pinched in that I could make out houses in better detail than I had expected. I especially like the self-timer for selfies. You can hit the two second one and after you hit the button to take the picture have two seconds to compose yourself... or longer... or even less, believe it or not. Great option. There is a quick charge technology charger included. Sony says if you charge the phone with it for 10 minutes you can get over 5 hours of battery life if you are running low. I didn't test that spec but I can say the battery life on this phone is great. It hardly went down in two hours of using it... I think it went down to the low 80's%. Granted battery life has to do more with what and how you are using it, but I was impressed. The phone processor is super fast. No issues at all in doing what I needed to do. The keyboard is intuitive. Gives you options as you type. I don't particularly like the swiping my finger from letter to letter....that has never worked well for me and usually I get the wrong suggestions. But it's there... SwiftKey keyboard. I thought this phone had the fingerprint option to unlock it. I couldn't find it in the settings....swipe a pattern, use a pin/password... but no fingerprint. So I looked at the manual and there it was for me to read... no fingerprint option on the US phones. I am out-of-luck. Wonder why that is not an option. Anyway, it's not there. Speaking of the manual you need to go to the Sony website and download it. It is huge and very comprehensive with a nice table of contents and index. I find it quite handy and learned a bunch of things. The phone itself has help topics you can check out as well. The phone runs on Android power.... version 6... Marshmallow. Actually the phone updated the software to 6.1. It handles updates very well. The phone is unlocked and can be used on the GSM network...AT&T, T-Mobile and a bunch of other ones. All in all I am quite impressed with everything about it. And it feels very nice to handle and hold. You will enjoy using it. It's very intuitive.",6,"Sony"

"583","B01FJT7MZC",5,"false","These days if you want a premium device you’re often faced with a critical compromise. It seems that all of the high-powered, feature-laden phones have been getting larger and larger. If you’re a power user and like to keep up with the latest tech, the last generation of devices forced you to choose between monster phablets or mid-sized devices that aren’t much smaller. And you sacrificed battery life. The Sony Xperia X Performance is a fantastic option if you want something that’s powerful but don’t want to lug around a boat anchor. I’ve used this phone as my daily driver for a couple of weeks now and I’m really impressed. I’m going to run down a list of my favorite features and why I think this phone, while missing some options critical for some users, is a really great device. -- The size and construction. The first thing I noticed about this device was compact size (compared to current market). Even being this slim and light you don’t miss anything on the screen. I was stepping down from the massively high ppi 1440x2560 Note 5 but I was still blown away by the brightness and clarity of this device at 1080. The brushed metal finish is clean and doesn’t attract fingerprints, and the beveled glass edges are comfortable in the pocket, and make it easy to take the phone in and out of a pocket or handbag. Be advised though: the curved glass edge makes it difficult to find a screen cover that fits well, although there are a few good looking options that I’ve seen on forums like XDA. It’s light---less than 6 ounces---but the phone feels solidly constructed. The finish and glass are durable. If you keep it out of the same pocket as your keys, this thing should continue looking pristine for quite some time. Another note: I love the Xperia System sounds. I think they are the best in the industry---charming, unique and diverse. -- The performance. Although I’m not particularly fond of Xperia’s Launcher and default wallpapers (it’s like a PINKSPLOSION in oil paint - they are so bright you can almost hear them), the UI is snappy and responsive. The Snapdragon 820 is a monster of a processor and, with the right launcher tweaks and setup, it is really effective on this device. There are 3 gigabytes of RAM, and this seems to be plenty of headroom to run any intensive apps. The 2700mAH battery is adequate. Battery life competes with with other premium devices. I usually have to top off in the late evening, but light use should keep you through a full day. -- The cameras and display! This phone sports a jaw-dropping 23 megapixel rear camera and a 13 megapixel front-facing camera. Both are phenomenal, and capture unbelievable images with very beautiful narrow depth-of-field capabilities (f2.0). One big complaint about this phone was its ability to only capture video in 1080. But this can be worked around by using Open Camera (available in the Play Store) to capture your videos. This also allows you to circumvent the super sensitive temperature block that keeps you from being able to capture when your device is actually at a safe temperature to operate. Low-light captures are really impressive, as are the macro functions. Sony’s integrated camera software has some amazing features that you can really get creative with. All of them are useful and function superbly. My favorite function in this category is the Triluminos display. It has the depth and clarity of a super AMOLED screen with out being super saturated. You get more honest representations of your images instead of the crazy contrasted cartoon effects that you often get on AMOLED screens. -- The Audio. I am an AUDIOPHILE, and this is an awesome phone for music lovers---especially if you like lossless audio content like FLAC. A big blocker for us is often the lack of storage on a device. The X Performance has a MicroSD slot that accommodates up to a 200GB card. It also has FLAC, LPCM, ALAC, and DSD playing functionality in Sony’s player. Clear Audio+ is a full featured audio enhancement suite that allows control via different settings, but there are plenty of other options in the Play store for more feature rich audio processing capability. Now, here's what it’s lacking: A fingerprint scanner. Moving from Samsung devices this was tough for me. I had to get used to a PIN again, but it didn’t take long. That's not a dealbreaker for me, but could be for other users. Sony’s storefront and apps that have push notifications (like What’s New) are aggravating, and it’s difficult to disable them. I understand their desire to push post-sales monetization opportunities, but annoying your users is not the way in my opinion. The Xperia Launcher---it’s okay, but it’s lacking and occasionally clunky. It’s too different from the Marshmallow/Material/N design and it clashes. It’s reminiscent of UI’s such as Acer’s with weird fonts, gaudy backgrounds and weird icons and useless permanent apps. Because of these issues I can’t give the out-of-the-box phone 5 stars, but Sony’s initiative with this development wins it 4 without a doubt. How you, the user, can make this phone a full 5 Stars (as I did). (BTW, do these things AT YOUR OWN RISK, as rooting your phone will kill functionalities like Android Pay and possibly void your warranty!) Go to XDA Developers Xperia X Performance forum for info on how to perform these actions. Technical advice on how to do such things is beyond the scope of this review. -- Root your phone. -- Use Titanium Backup to freeze all of the Perma-apps and useless functions. -- Install Open Camera. -- Install cleaner-running system apps like Textra, Today Calendar, etc. -- Use a cleaner launcher like Nova After these small adjustments I find myself using this phone almost exclusively. If you’re looking for a ton of power in a small package, then this is a good device for you. If you don’t mind unlocking your bootloader and playing with the OS a bit, then this will be a GREAT device for you.",24,"Sony"

The phone shows no signs of damage and the screen is still in perfect condition. And I threw the damn thing hard. With that said, if the phone actually worked I wouldn't be throwing it at brick walls. This idiot phone can't hold a signal during calls. Even with a brand new signal booster at work and home, incoming calls can never get through and the moment I try to make a call my 5 bars of LTE plummets to absolutely nothing. Sure, it handles everything else just fine. Mostly. When it isn't lagging. Battery life is great as the phone utilizes state of the art call dropping technology to ensure no calls can be made, which in turn preserves power. This phone has been very reliable and consistent. It doesn't overheat or crash randomly. It doesn't like sending texts or being on calls. It loves being thrown into hard surfaces. I have a love hate relationship with this brick. I want to love it.

"598","B01FJT7N4W",5,"true","I think this is a really under rated phone, likely due to the really high launch price. I spent $300 and it's worth every penny. No big issues and is much zippier than the blu phone. - Performance: The phone runs everything I throw at it with ease and simpler tasks like browsing are noticeably smoother than the blu phone. The snapdragon 650 hexacore is a bit of an older chip however performs admirably and the hexacore design 2x 1.8ghz and 4x 1.2ghz is a very efficient design, especially against the slow 8 core used in the life one x. The gpu is Adreno 510, a strong mid-mid to high-mid GPU that can handle moderately intensive and casual games. Have realistic expectations though, it's not top of the line and probably won't run the most intensive apps on the play store smoothly. 3 gigabytes of RAM is more than enough and multitasks effortlessly. I've never had any issues with the internal storage or the 32g microSD card that I put in. If you have a PS4 you can use the controller with the phone and do some other supposedly nifty stuff. - Camera: The camera is a bit odd, likely due to software. When looking through the camera in the app, it's not that great looking but when it snaps the pic, it comes out much nicer. Most phones is the other way around. Points for the lack of motion blur that I've seen on every other phone I've used. A very annoying quirk about the camera app is that it cannot be used in portrait view. I'm looking around for other apps to replace Sony's but the camera by itself is a good one. Not mind blowing but good. When buying any phone, remember that megapixel count is actually a very negligible spec when it comes to predicting photo quality. - Wireless: One of the reasons I ditched the blu is because of the lackluster cellular coverage. The Xperia x exceeds my expectations in this area and it gets LTE almost anywhere I go with AT&T. Sometimes it's so quick I forget i'm not on wifi! One of the other users say that wifi isn't that great. Mine works fine but drops out for a half-minute or so occasionally. My college's wireless network regresses every year though so I just chalk it up to that. * ATT uses bands 2, 4, 5, 12 (lightly), and 17 (heavily) in the US. The blu was missing 12, don't pull a me and make sure a phone has the necessary bands before buying it! Many descriptions don't have them clearly listed, so use GSMarena if unsure <http://www.gsmarena.com> The SIM slot takes nano SIM only, you can have a guy at any ATT store swap it in like 5 minutes if you don't have one. - Battery: Lasts me all day and then some with normal usage. You could probably get 2 days out of it with just browsing and with Sony's power-saving options on. It charges rediculously quick too, like 0 to 100% in an hour quick. I hope the battery keeps up with time. - Chassis: The reason why I got this phone in particular was the looks. They're every bit as beautiful as in the picture. It's not the most comfortable phone to hold but that can likely be fixed with a case. The brushed aluminum back, the classic camera placement (top left corner) and the curved glass edges is really pretty and is subtly classy and sexy at the same time (the James Bond of phones), a rare look in phones today. Surprisingly, both sides of the phone are pretty resistant to fingerprints and smudging, I haven't cleaned it in the 2 weeks or so that I've had it and not a single smudge. The speakers on the top and bottom of the front panel are clear because of the placement, but they aren't high quality speakers in any sense, but I usually wear headphones and those sound fine. It doesn't go as loud as my iPod 5 (which is probably a good thing). Volume button is in a really weird placement that you wouldn't think much of by looking at the pictures on here. Display is sharp, there really isn't a need for anything above 1080p on a phone as the eye can't easily see the difference and a higher resolution just taxes the GPU harder, leading to lower performance. Wish notification light was placed elsewhere and was brighter, but whatev. - Software: I don't like Sony's UI much, I prefer the blu's. It's not much of an issue with android because you can download any launcher you wish and change the UI from there; I use Apex and it looks fine. As said, the camera app kind of sucks. No small amount of bloatware that can't be deleted either, though at least it doesn't have all the crap from a carrier and most of it can be disabled anyway, so the phone doesn't skip any beats. Overall a very good mid range phone that's definitely worth the price is is now (still 300). I'd give it a 4.8 for the meh software and the few chassis mishaps, but even looking for one, I cannot find an issue that would give me pause if I'd known it before buying. The stuff that the phone does right, blows the minor faults out of the water anyway. I wholeheartedly recommend giving this phone a shot; it may pleasantly surprise you as it did me. Congrats if you read this far, hope it was worth your time :)",47,"Sony"
"599","B01FJT7N4W",1,"true","I've order this phone because my Xperia Z1 Compact (that I really liked) suddenly died - stopped working after 1 year and 8 months without any reason. I liked my Z1 and don't have any complaints other than that it died so quickly. I decided to try something a little bigger and newer. I choose Xperia X because the camera promised to be great and overall performance. However, it turned out to be very disappointing. The quality of pictures are very poor. The images are not sharp, instead they're quite blurry regardless of the settings. In addition, the phone battery life is terrible, I used it for a short time to test pictures and video - battery went from 100% to 30% and the phone overheated. On another day, I used it very lightly - only checked emails few times and took few pictures - the phone battery went from 100% down to 20% by evening (I didn't add any apps and didn't run any games). I also need to mentioned that color is not truly pink as shown on the internet. It actually a very light copper color, more like a new penny color - not pink at all. I am returning this phone back and will look for something that provides better quality pictures and has a longer battery life.

The battery life is really pretty good, and I like the fact that I can leave it off charge overnight and it doesn't lose all its charge (though this may be due to the Android 6 power settings rather than Sony).

"607","B01FJT7N4W",1,"false","I bought this phone three years ago and paid full price for it (almost $600). It is by far the worst phone I have ever owned. The good: --It's attractive and the right size for me; I will never carry a phablet and this was my switch from an iPhone to an Android since Apple went through a couple of years where they refused to make phones small enough to operate with one hand. --It's waterproof, for about a month or until the first time you knock or drop it and it chips the very flimsy plastic exterior or breaks the back cover seal, which is just a sticker. The bad: The screen is quite poor (the digitizer is visible in most lighting conditions and the colors and resolution aren't very vidid). The camera is sluggish. Updates are practically non-existent. There is SO MUCH bloatware from Sony that's not removable. The ugly: The battery died less than ten months after I bought this phone. Died as in would last an hour, maybe two. Sony refused to service the phone at all since it wasn't under warranty (remember how I said I paid full-price for it since I bought it about a month after it was released and the US version didn't have the finderprint sensor?). I had multiple conversations with them where I explained that I was happy to pay to have the battery replaced, but needed help (the phone is not user-serviceable at all, and although I'd replaced my iPhone battery a couple of times, the construction on this phone is much flimsier). They told me there was no service center in the US (really?) and that even if there were, they would refuse to service the phone anyway. I am now on battery number four, they last well under a year before it gets to a point where I keep the phone on the lowest brightness setting and barely use it, and it's still dead less than two hours later. After the first battery replacement, the phone was no longer waterproof since, as mentioned, the back cover is attached with only a double-sided tape sticker. The replacement OEM stickers don't work great even if you don't mess with your phone because water, heat, air, and other elements that your waterproof phone is supposed to be impervious to weaken the seal. The bluetooth sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. I was about to purchase battery number five when the fingerprint sensor also gave out, and no software or hardware intervention has helped with that. Overall: STAY AWAY. Get a Moto G6 or Nokia 6.1 or something else if the form factor is what you're looking for. This phone is a piece of trash. Just in case you think this is a fluke, Sony's forums are full of people reporting battery problems and lots of hardware and software issues (before when the battery allowed the phone to be on for more that a couple of hours, I'd have to restart it and usually do a hard reset at least once a week because of irrecoverable software failures). I had two friends who own this phone (one had the previous version, the Z3 compact, which is what inspired me to buy it) and they both got rid of theirs well over a year ago because of battery and software failures.",NA,"Sony"
"608","B01FJT7N4W",4,"true","For what I paid (under $230) it's well-worth it for a 2016 midrange phone. It gets decent battery life (I get through a day, sometimes slightly more depending on usage), the screen is great, has great sound (dual front-facing speakers) though a bit quiet, expandable storage, and is still getting updates from Sony. The camera is not at all as good as I thought it should be and my 4-year-old Samsung Note 4 takes far better pictures. It's a little slippery (similar to an iPhone 6s) and in the stock OS the UI animations stutter once and a while. I don't care for the slim side-mount finger print scanner but once it's set up it's VERY fast. The volume button placement is... confusing... It's impossible to change the volume one-handed without nearly dropping the phone. No idea what they were thinking on that one. I bought this specifically to try Sailfish X and while it was neat I quickly went back to an Android ROM. One thing I was surprised to see was while this device is covered by Sony's Open Device program, once you unlock the bootloader you can never go back to stock. Still, the people running Sony's Open Device program are responsive and have been putting out amazing updates so it all depends what you're looking for. It's also worth noting that while the stock OS is 32-bit, the Qualcomm 650 CPU supports 64-bit and I'm running a 64-bit ROM without issue, which is important for near-future proofing as 32-bit gets phased out.",4,"Sony"

The good thing is the smaller 5"" screen slips easily into most pants pockets, but it also means that the beautiful clarity of the screen can't be as fully enjoyed as it might be on a larger size. The unlocked status of this phone meant my current AT&T SIM card was active immediately when I swapped it from my LG to the Sony and back - zero problems. The micro SD card was recognized immediately and is holding apps, games and photos as it should. I was expecting the unlocked version to have significantly less bloatware than the typical carrier purchased phone and while this does have less, it is not bloat free. There are a number of hard loaded Sony apps and things like Facebook and Spotify that you can't delete. (I realize most people want Facebook, but I am not one who wants it as a mandatory, intrusive app on my phone) In comparison to the LG V10 in performance - the LG runs faster with 3 or more apps going at once. For example, texting and watching a YouTube video and doing email at once on the LG is smooth and lag free. The Sony stutters and the YouTube video ended up buffering and had to be stopped when a flurry of texts came in. It took me awhile to figure out why, but I realized it is because the Sony doesn't hold a WiFi connection as well as the LG in the same room, side by side on the same network. My LG and my husband's Blu phone will both show full strength Wi-Fi signal and this phone next to them will show 2/3 strength. Same results in three different homes with three different routers and networks - it just doesn't have great reception. What I absolutely love about the Sony Xperia X is the camera and the Xperia movie builder app. Holy cow does this thing take pretty pictures! It is spectacular at outdoor nature shots and especially backlit shots in bright sunlight. Taking multiple action pictures of horses galloping and changing directions was very nice - 12 shots in a row and only one was blurry. The details and color it gets with flowers and animals are so good that I am taking this phone on vacation to a National Park in a couple of weeks specifically to use as a camera. (My LG V10 is going as my communication device) The built in movie builder app is just a cute little gizmo that takes your still shots & puts them to music and makes a video for you - I've had a ball with it and the horse pictures. The phone comes with a fast charging wall charger and it is quick. The Bluetooth connected easily with my Echo and a pair of generic headphones and my Ford Sync system. So far the battery life has been excellent and slightly better than on my LG. My bottom line is that this is a decent phone and an excellent camera, but in the final tally, I think the poor WiFi reception and laggy behavior with multiple functions running at once means that I won't be leaving my LG V10 and making the Sony X my daily phone. ****** UPDATE August 5 2016. ****** I added the Magic Jack app to this phone recently for use with our Magic Jack account when traveling overseas. It allows you to call the United States without incurring international roaming fees by using a Wi-Fi connection. In initial testing this week, it is working, but the weak Wi-Fi reception on this phone makes this function sketchy unless you are in just the perfect spot.",62,"Sony"
"614","B01FJT7N4W",4,"true","Pros: Sleek design. Fast, no lag at all after a couple days of moderate use. Great speakers, and great sound quality through headphone jack. Super easy to transfer data from your old phone. SIM card and SD card from your old phone can be put in by yourself, so there's no need to go to your carrier's store for assistance. Cool double tap feature that you can set up to wake up the phone from sleep. Charges moderately quickly, and battery lasts plenty long. Camera button on bottom right is in the perfect place. Good front and back cameras. Great screen resolution. Streams 1080p. Cons: No home button; I knew that it didn't have one when I bought it, but I like the click, instead of just the icon on the screen. Volume buttons are in an awkward place. You can't hold down a volume button to increase/decrease volume dramatically; you have to click the button each time to change the volume. Comes with a lot of apps that you probably won't ever use - It's a 32 GB phone, so those apps don't take up too much space, but if you're coming from a 128 or 64 GB phone it might bug you that these apps are taking up space. It has a pretty weak flashlight/camera flash.",4,"Sony"

It makes calls, it has a very good camera, runs all the apps...best of all has a form-factor that is fits human hands (one of the key reason I bought it). I got it just a few days ago..very satisfied so far.. Update: WiFi reception is less robust than my prior Samsung phone. This issue appears to be more pronounced when both Bluetooth and WiFi are ON at the same time.",5,"Sony"
"616","B01FJT7N4W",5,"true","#First Impresion. My last phone was Samsung Galaxy Duos and I upgrade my phone to this one looking for a phone with much faster performance and better build quality, since I mostly use my phone for communicating with people, taking pictures once in a while and watching random youtube videos. I bought the white version and so far I really love the build quality! The quick charger works pretty well. It took me around 1 hour to fully charge the Xperia X from 30% to 100%. (Since I came from a very old phone) The camera is great, the screen is gorgeous and the phone size is just perfect for my hand. # 2 weeks After two weeks using this phone I just can say that I really enjoy using this phone. The battery life can sustain for 1.5 day if you don't use the phone often (just chatting, looking social media, browsing a little bit). But if you use it for gaming, it can only last for 3-4 hours. Since I only use this phone for communication, and some browsing, it's totally fit the purpose. And the quick charging feature also works fine. Again, camera is superb for me. And the dual front speaker is also great to listen. Also, I have never experienced any lagging so far. Last thing, I realized why the build quality of this phone is so beautiful when I tried to compare my phone to my friend's iPhone 6s. And it turns out that their build quality are similar. The only difference is that this Sony phone is thicker, which is still acceptable for me. Some negatives that you might experience: - fingerprint sensor is installed, but you can not use it in US version - that's unfortunate, - i occasionally miss-type on the swift keyboard - somehow i feel it is too dense. But other than that it's just a great phone. Since the price of this phone is a little bit cheaper than a new iPhone SE 16GB, I will easily choose this phone over the iPhone SE.",3,"Sony"

"619","B01FJT7N4W",3,"false","I refuse to give a high rating to any phone just because it is better than most of the other junk out there. As far as cell phones go, I'd say the Sony Xperia X is pretty good but I don't own all the zillion other Samsung and other brand devices. Android is terrible, but has improved with each new major version. The ""camera"" button was extremely annoying (very easy to accidentally push it) so I searched for how to assign it some other function (couldn't find a way). Finally I discovered in the camera app itself a poorly worded ""Quick Launch"" option that turns it off. It was tough for me to switch from my BlackBerry Leap to this phone. Both phones are almost identical in size. By specs the Xperia has a higher resolution screen but comparing photos side by side they look identical. Android (Swiftkey?) has improved the touchscreen keyboard but the BlackBerry keyboard remains the only touchscreen keyboard that doesn't make me want to puke. It's a shame that BlackBerry hasn't been more successful as their OS 10.x is far easier to use (makes more intuitive sense) than Android (even 6). If I like the BlackBerry Leap so much better then why did I finally switch (even with the new Xperia costing me nothing)? Well basically for two reasons: 1) Compatibility; 2) More memory Even though I use very, very few apps on a phone, the BlackBerry was frustrating in not supporting a few apps that I wanted. And like it or not, more and more of our world is using cell phone control (like intelligent thermostats). I dislike cell phones. The attempt to make a tiny device the center of your computing world just doesn't make sense to me, the screens are tiny (even for the largest phones and even on small tablets) and there is no good input device (why did everyone phase out physical keyboards?). The ""Palm"" was the last phone that was well designed and unfortunately they died off about ten years ago.",1,"Sony"
"620","B01FJT7N4W",4,"true","It arrive in pristine condition and somehow has the fingerprint scanner enabled; I thought this feature was disabled in the US? Anyway, if you're buying this in 2018 prepare to spend the first couple hours or so installing 2 years worth of Android updates (which is both good and bad). This is my first non-Nexus device in 5 years so the pre-installed, irremovable apps are a bit of an annoyance, but thankfully the bloat is minimal and you have most of your phone's resources at your disposal. All in all, I enjoyed using this phone in the few hours I've had it -- it's responsive, smooth and the build is pretty nice. This will serve as a fine replacement for my Nexus 5.",1,"Sony"
"621","B01FJT7N4W",5,"true","I bought this phone 1 year ago and still using it currently. So now it's good time to review it. Pretty satisfied of this model. It still works quickly, never any lags, so processor is very good. The screen shows a great picture which is very detalized and bright cause it has high pixels resolution. Camera makes high quality pictures. Very like its design, it looks nice and stylish. Finger print sencor always works properly, and also I like the face identification feature in it. But there are some disadvantages also. The only what I don't like is overheating of camera. So when it's hot outside and you wanna take some pictures, the camera gets died because overheating after 5-10 minutes of working. It shows you notification on a screen and go off. The other thing is battery capasity. It's actually not very big from a stock, and now after a year passed I see the battery runs out much more quickly.

The phone it self looks brand new with a matt shield that covers the screen and back of the phone. Since the phone is unlocked I decided just to pop in my Sim card. At first nothing was happening. The phone wasn't recognizing my Sim card. The box says unlocked. So I call up my mobile carrier which is Metro pcs. Heres the thing. Yes the phone is unlocked but since it's not an actual metro phone I have to purchase a new Sim and pay for activation $25 While I was in the Metro store and the phone was set up with a new Sim. They had me test the phone by making a phone call. You will notice immediately that the sound is just TERRIBLE. I could barely hear my friend on the other side. So low that I was like WHAT? SAY THAT AGAIN? I loaded up a YouTube video and the sound also is TERRIBLE. After about an hour of searching the web for results. I read that you have to totally update the phone. So about after 3 hours of updating (I'm not kidding) the sound is 50% better. I can hear the person on the other side clearly not the best but doable. YouTube videos sound great now. My only complaint, Phone says 32 gigs but after all the updates and apps preloaded that can't be removed. Your phone only has 14 gigs of use. I gave it a 4 star for all the updates just to get the phone working decent. I should have bought the z3+ but only model they have are 16 gig versions which means that the actual storage could be 6-10 gigs after updating. Good luck. ***UPDATE*** AUGUST 2ND The only thing I don't like about this phone is that when you're trying to use the camera it says overheating. All I want to do is take some pictures and after about the 10th picture phone says it's overheating. It doesn't shut off my phone but it does stop you from making videos.

My hands are not large and most screens are too wide and I can't wrap my hand around them. Also when I go out I like to use a small purse in which most phone don't fit inside if I want to carry a few other items but this one does! Another feature I enjoy are two speakers that get pretty loud. Overall great phone and price tag. Heads up when getting the phone...

"631","B01FJT7N4W",2,"true","As problematic as my last phones, but at least it comes with more internal memory. The texting still has the guess mode built it, that cannot be disabled. So texts come up saying all kinds of weird things that can be very frustrating, downright confusing, and sometimes inappropriate! Very hard to correct the A I's word selections. And even after correcting, many times after hitting 'send',the words get changed back to the incorrect ones! If I hadn't of run out of internal memory (which apps run off of - so having a memory card in it doesn't solve the issue), I would have just continued with my old phone - but since I had to upgrade, I really was hoping that the very frustrating issue with texting would have been solved for this phone - but alas, no.

And I asked them to send me the parts, I repair it myself. They refused. Then it means warranty of 12 months is worthless. Maybe that's why Sony is unable to expand their cell phone market share, to compete with Apple and Samsung in the US. Sony management admitted that they do not really care to improve their cell phone department couple years ago. If they close the cell phone department, it will affect their source of supply and other products. Pro: Great camera and ""SOME"", not all, nice design.

This issue alone causes me to regret my purchase. It is still a good phone, however when traveling internationally I rely on wifi calling to call clients and family in the States. That became an impossibility with this phone.",NA,"Sony"
"642","B01FJT7N4W",4,"true","I purchased this phone (US version - model F5121) on Amazon back in November 2017. My review is a bit late. Again, for a non-flagship phone under $250, this is a bargain! It is a very balanced phone as far as features are concerned. The Sony retail price ($550), is a joke so buy it when it is under $250. Pros: FANTASTIC battery life: I don't get some of the reviews on how bad the battery is. The phone lives up to the advertising. Even with moderate to moderate/heavy use, a user should get 2 days of battery life from a full charge. I can usually get close to 4 days. Also, with the Qnovo battery inside, this phone is reported to have a cycle life of 800 charging cycles (compared to the standard of 500-600 you get with more 'popular' phones like Apple or Samsung). If you get 2 days of use from a full charge, this battery would last around 4 years before the battery would start to loose optimal charge / functional capacity (i.e. depleted). Even after 1.5 years, my Xperia X still charges pretty quickly with the Quick Charge 2.0 technology (you have to use the supplied adapter AND cable to utilize the technology, otherwise it charges at a 'standard' slow rate). Evidently, you can leave this phone plugged in after it reaches 100% charge and the adaptive technology inside will automatically cut off current to the battery to prevent damage. Once it hits 90%, the charge speed slows WAY down (evidently to prevent damaging the battery when it is nearly at full capacity). SIZE: If you are looking for a phone and not an oversized brick to hold to your ear, this is a solid phone. A 5 inch full HD display. STORAGE: In addition to 32GB onboard storage, this can hold a 200 GB memory card. For the year (2016) this phone was released, not too bad. Other users have indicated they have added a 256 GB memory card and not had a problem. SPEED: This phone is pretty snappy with the CPU and GPU inside. There is really no lag or choppiness in day to day operations. Also, this phone will update to Android 8.0 from 6.0. The downside for a new owner is that the phone will spend a LOT of time requesting updates when first turned on because it has sat in a box. I spent several hours the day I received it just charging it and waiting for the phone to complete all the updates it was behind on. Once it was finished updating, I hardly saw any more update requests (even now hardly any). DISPLAY: This phone has technology (triluminos, X-reality) that Sony incorporates into some of their TV lines. When watching an HD movie on this screen, the colors and quality are quite impressive for a midrange phone - well above average. FEATURES: FM radio with RDS, NFC, AC wireless, quick charge, triluminos display, X-Reality, etc...This phone beats many midrange Android phones on the market (even 3 years later). ENERGY management: The UI provides many energy saving features to assist the battery in providing you a lot of use on a charge. You had enable them or disable some or all of them in the settings. Overall, the UI isn't the greatest but it gets the job done for a mid range phone. Cons: Camera: I know, it sounds ungrateful given it is a Sony. The Xperia X comes with a SUBPAR 23MP main camera. From my experience, the 8MP mode for the main camera is the best. It will easily give Samsung and iPhones a run for their money. However, I found the 20 and 23MP settings to produce somewhat blurry, faded and 'washed out' photos (both close up and distant). The 8MP setting provides crisp, colorful pictures. I haven't done much with the front facing camera but it seems to be decent. For Sony's reputation and camera technology, they could have done a better job (or just added a lower MP main camera and maintained quality). However, I won't rap on Sony too much given this isn't a flagship phone - just an average model in their phone line. SOUND: Again, given Sony's reputation for sound, this could have been better. It does come with dual, front facing stereo speakers, but the volume is inadequate unless you are sitting in a perfectly quiet environment. If any kind of ambient / background noise is present, the sound volume at maximum is too low. If you have quality headphones on, the volume improves a little but Sony could have done better in providing more 'kick' to the speakers. Again, keep in mind this is NOT a flagship phone. SUPPORT: Evidently, Sony just removed this phone from their product page while some phone which came out at the same time (or even a little earlier) are still listed. Really? This is an Xperia / X series and Sony is still producing X series phones (and the Xperia X is still being sold - new and used - on places like Amazon and ebay). Why has this particular phone model been removed from the product page? OVERALL, I would give this phone 4.5 stars. However, I wouldn't pay more than $250 for it. FYI, you can buy a replacement battery for this phone on ebay (still as of the date of this review). If you feel so inclined, I'd like to see your feedback below.",NA,"Sony"

There is some bloatware, but that can be disabled no problem. The battery life isn't as bad as I thought according to other reviews, it's perfectly acceptable and has no trouble lasting an entire work day. LTE is plenty fast on the T-Mobile network. In the sub $300 category, it's very hard to beat because it includes features other phones in this category lack, namely NFC, amount of RAM, and a good camera. While it is a little over a year old at the time of purchase, I'd imagine the custom ROM community will keep it going once Sony declares it EOL.",1,"Sony"

The camera is great when in natural lighting, very poor in low lighting and DOES NOT work when the phone is overheating, and the shutter is quite slow at times. Action shots are poor. The phone overheats a couple times a week, while charging particularly or when it is hot outside or you are near a heater. It is frustrating at time When the phone is dying it is exceptionally slow Other than that I do not have many other complaints. Battery lasts quite a while!

"672","B01FJT7N4W",3,"false","The new Xperia X is a rare miss from Sony. The phone itself really isn't that bad, but everything in it is just the bare minimum. Snapdragon 650, 3GB Ram, and a decent camera. There isn't a single stand-out feature in the phone - it has a relatively weak battery, basic camera, low-end processor and a full-hd screen. All of this would be just fine if it was priced at $299 or less - but at this price point ($499), you are much better off with a Nexus 5x, Nexus 6p, Nextbit Robin or one of the many other popular unlocked phones. The display on the X is OK - but it is only Full HD. It is definitely a bright screen though, and probably the best part of the phone. Other features Sony prominently mentions are the ability to do PS4 remote play, Hi-Res audio playback and decent wireless band support (though only on GSM carriers, so no Verizon or Sprint). The phone supports QNOVO quick charge, which is thankfully compatible with Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0. A fast adaptive charger is included. As someone who has an Xperia Z5 Premium, I'd recommend that over the new X any day. You'll get a much better display, same 23MP rear camera (with LED flash, though a lower resolution front camera), fingerprint scanner integrated in the power button, much faster CPU, same memory and same mobile operator support. Bottom line here - Sony didn't make a bad phone, they just made a mediocre phone with a ridiculous price. The basic model X is NO flagship. With so many other phones selling at this same price point or just a little higher, there are far better options to be found for your hard earned cash.",24,"Sony"

It is also (as of April 2018) still getting regular updates; it's rarely been more than a month behind on Android security patches, something I can't say about other Android phones I've had. But I most want to point out that mine got tangled in the bed comforter, and went through the entire wash cycle from pre-soak to HE spin. The phone was still running when it came out of the washer.

"682","B01FJT7N4W",5,"false","For an iPhone user, adapting to the Android operating system takes patience, time and a certain reinvention of your normal Mac inclinations. Sony’s Xperia X Command cell phone (unlocked) is a superb device to acquaint the new user and transit from an iPhone 6 to Android OS. Xperia’s shiny screen, the same width as the iPhone, is 1/4” inch longer, noticeably brighter (radiant may be the right word), the colors richer and with more depth and click or swipe response time between apps markedly faster. Sony’s design is sleek and modern, corners are round, not sharp, the back is a hard tactile plastic but with an inexpensive slip case (from Amazon) secure and comfortable to one’s grip (the device’s length measures 5 ½” w/o slip case, 5 5/8 with case). Its battery charges up quickly; surely faster than the iPhone and can last for two (2) days according to the manufacturer. There is a modest amount of “bloatware” when one swipes left (games, etc.) but this is minor annoyance. The rear-mounted camera produces vivid photos with notable clarity and detail. It shoots videos or stills. For extra storage, a SD card tray is part of your carrier’s SIM tray on the side which makes the device ideal for watching sports or movies. The range of the Android OS impresses and this fine cell phone makes the transition a welcome treat.",2,"Sony"
"683","B01FJT7N4W",4,"false","Where has this been all my life? Great ""Mom"" phone. The camera is outstanding and I would say I used it daily. The low light settings that would normally show a black screen on my iPhone are these fantastic soft pictures. For someone who uses their phone for pictures and doesn't like to carry around another camera, this phone is perfect. Other aspects. Smooth, large screen, fast processor (much quicker than my iPhone 6) and I love their calendar. But I have a learning curve at this point as I have been with an iPhone the last 4 years. There is not as many permanent items in this phone and there is a large amount of storage. That is a huge plus. I love the fact that you can add more storage with a micro disk. That was always a huge issue with apple and their forced use of the iCloud that I never really liked or trusted. But their message/phone/contact is something that doesn't seem to work as quick or as easy. I will update if I feel differently after I get used to it some more. There aren't a lot of options and accessories for these Sony phones but I hope as they get more popular there will be. The screen and resolution are beautiful, the pictures incredible.

"684","B01FJT7N4W",3,"false","The Sony Xperia X is an ok device. Here's what I liked and dislike about it and why. Basically, I had to go back to my old device. Likes: - Beautiful, sleek, metal design. Although the back of the phone doesn't feel very sturdy. - Pretty compact and easy to carry around. - Stunning display, with colorful and rich tones throughout. - Very good camera with a nice amount of features. - Came with a minimal amount of bloatware. Dislikes - Battery life is pretty horrible. This is the first device in a long time where I wasn't confident I could get through the day without having to carry around my travel charger. - Lacks features that even mid-ranged devices have these days: + No fingerprint scanner. It's disabled in the US variant of this this device but enabled everywhere else in the world. + Limited phone features like reverse lookup and a decent blocked call or text setup. - The tap to wake feature is finicky. Either you have to tap hard or it doesn't come on at all. Either it's too sensitive or not sensitive enough. - Has front facing speakers that aren't very loud. - Screen doesn't turn on when I get a message of any kind. Only the notification light will blink. - Camera doesn't remain in the settings I left it on. It keeps defaulting to the auto settings. - If the phone gets warm or supposedly overheats, the camera will give you an error message and will shut off. I have never seen this on any phone I've used and I've used many. - Not integrated enough with Google for my liking. - Overpriced especially considering the features it lacks. What I liked about the phone actually prompted me to keep this phone longer than I would normally have. While this phone is not terrible and is perfectly acceptable for the casual user, I don't feel comfortable with this phone being a reliable, daily driver due to its shortcomings.",2,"Sony"
"685","B01FJT7N4W",4,"false","It's good to see Sony battling back to get a market share of the smartphone market. It's better for competition. But, the Xperia X misses the mark as a premium phone it strives to be. At the $500 price, we better be expecting excellence all around. The camera quality and design are the stand outs, but the performance and internals really don't warrant a $500 phone. It does everything a little above average, with the exception of an excellent camera. Nothing else really made me excited. Screen - beautiful. It's bright, clear and vivid. Awesome for games, texting, browsing. Design - Super slim. All of the buttons on the sides are flattened and does not pop out. Good if the phone is often in your pocket. The volume buttons might be a bit hard to distinguish at first. Headphone jack located at top left corner. Camera quality - Probably the best part of this phone. Super sharp and easy to use. The autofocus is snappy and awesome. Performance - It's quick and fast. Fluid app loading and browsing. It's like a very good high end i5. But it's like I expected a low end i7 for this price. This is a very solid phone, but not $500 worthy. The oneplus 3 has similar if not better specs for ~$400.",2,"Sony"

I was tired of black phones and decided to try something new. I even bought transparent case to enjoy of the color. It looks really really good. Got compliments from people. It's so nice to hold it in my hand. The size is just perfect for me. Every time I touch the screen, it feels awesome! Rounded edges is a big plus. Performance is solid and free of lagging, if you are not extreme user. 32GB of storage is okay, but you get much less of free space. 3GB of RAM is good. Fingerprint sensor is a very useful thing. However, you will have to install a firmware from another region to enable it (do it on your own fear and risk! I do not recommend you to do this). They locked the sensor in US version as you may already know. What else to say? Camera is okay. I was not able to test it a lot, as I don't care that much about camera, but it's definitely nice to have 13mp frontal camera. Flash light of the rear camera is stronger that was on Z2. I use bank app to deposit checks and it's hard to take a good picture of check when you don't have enough light around. Flash is strong and it makes checks too light and hard to read. Reception is good. Nice to finally have band 12, it really helps with T-Mobile. Wi-Fi connection is solid and didn't give me any headaches. Battery life is fine for me, I start every day with 100% charge and usually finish with 20-30%. Have to charge every night. -------------------------------------- P.S.

So far, the only issue I've had with this in the first week of use has been overheating whilst charging and using camera at the same time. 😬 I hope it's not a preview of future performance, as the z1 only started acting up after it had been accidently dropped on numerous occasions. Headphones, interestingly, we're not included. Love the ease of the interface, and excellent camera quality. Miss the glass backing.",1,"Sony"
"741","B01FJT7N4W",5,"true","I get so many compliments on this smart phone! No one would know that I paid so little for this great phone unless I told them. It is about as fast as an Iphone 7 (in my opinion). The main drawback to this phone is the ridiculous amount of updates you have to do before you can bring it up to current standards. So plan on spending about 4 hours doing this (no joke). The other drawback is that the phone overheats when you are out in the sun on a 90 degree day, so it might slow down when you are outside in the summer. Other than that, I am very happy with my purchase.",1,"Sony"

"745","B01FJT7N4W",1,"true","I never, ever write reviews, but this phone infuriates me so much I have to. This is the first phone I have ever owned. Here's why: 1. It's SLOW. And I mean SLOW. It's slow to boot up, to charge, to open apps, and to load web pages. In fact, don't even try to browse the web, it won't work. Even on high-speed WiFi with 100 mbps simple static html web pages will take up to 2 minutes to load if they ever do. Tested in tandem on the same web page with an older phone with half the memory and a slower processor, the SONY Experia consistently takes 4 times longer. I attribute this to a very bad antenna, but I'm not an expert. 2. INVASIVE, UNINSTALLABLE BOATWARE. It has more boatware than I've seen on any phone. The SONY Experia apps are practically malware: they are invasive, collect tons of personal data, and push notifications down your throat at all hours of the day and night. Forget about uninstalling them, you can't even DISABLE them. You can force stop some of them, but they will reactivate the next time you reboot. 3. COUNTERINTUITIVE and CONFUSING. Most of the OS seems like stock Android, but features SONY did modify behave so counterintuitively it's as if they intentionally engineered it to cause user error. Even the button placement is awkward and difficult to access. It's also very slick to the touch and leaps out of my hand. 4. BATTERY DRAIN. Part of the reason I bought this is because I read the battery lasts and charges quickly. That hasn't been my experience. It drops to 85 percent within 15 minutes of unplugging it. It takes 4 hours to charge from 50 to 100 percent, even plugged into the wall with the stock SONY Experia charger that came with it. Maybe the battery would do better if there weren't so much boatware... Oh, and the charging port only fits the cable that came with it. No other micro SD cables I own including brand new Amazon cables fit. That means I either have to jiggle them to get them to charge or they don't work at all. 5. SETTINGS REVERT TO DEFAULT. Never heard of this before. No matter how many times I change them, the settings don't stick. 6. QUIET MICROPHONE. This is a killer. On max volume even the most obnoxious alarm is too quiet to wake me up. And I'm a light sleeper. This is pretty much the worst phone I've ever owned, folks. It's only redeeming quality is the camera. But if you want a nice camera you can probably find a decent DSLR for around the price you'll pay for this infuriating brick.",3,"Sony"

"753","B01FJT7N4W",4,"false","Ever since the very first Android HTC “smart phone” several years ago, I’ve owned more phones than I can recall. Looking at a few recent phones, I’ve owned Galaxy Note 3/4, Galaxy S 4/5, LG G2/3/4, Nokia 1520, Xperia Z Ultra, and my current daily driver, the Nexus 6. I’m rather familiar with smartphones. :) So let’s take that experience and see how the latest from Sony performs compared to the world of smartphones. PROS: + Snappy 64-bit Snapdragon 650 SoC + Smooth Near-Stock Android User Interface + Dedicated 2-stage camera button + Expandable MicroSD Storage, up to 2TB (when available) + Standard 32GB Internal Storage (not 16GB!) + Fantastic 5” 1080p IPS Display + Decent Battery Life + Fast Micro-USB Charge Capable + Forward Facing Stereo Speakers! + Excellent 13MP Front camera with crisp/sharp images + Virtually all LTE bands supported (GSM only) + Useful Xperia software included + Solid Build Quality & Feel + Factory Unlocked! + Good button placement and feel + Solid value while on-sale CONS: - Battery could be larger - No Wireless Charging - No Water resistance - Sony bloatware which can’t be removed - Phone runs hot at times - Rear camera location easy to block - Wi-Fi speeds are only average - List price a bit high DESIGN The Xperia X5 is a 5” phone with the usual Sony design aesthetics. Featuring squarish corners with a slight curve at the edges of the glass screen to make holding/swiping more comfortable. The backing is plastic, but doesn’t feel cheap, and does an “OK” job of resisting fingerprints. Beyond that, there is the usual micro-USB port at the bottom, headphone jack at the top, and volume/power/camera button all on the right. Speaking of which, the power button is large and due to the shape/indention, is very easy to press. No more hitting volume buttons by mistake, or vise versa. The single Nano-SIM and MicroSD tray is on the left. As an added bonus, you can actually remove it with your finger nails. On the front you have a very useful notification LED, which I’ve missed more than expected on my Nexus 6. As well as my favorite feature, front facing stereo speakers. As with most Sony phones, they have a good high-end quality appearance and feel. But lean towards a more understated look. Nothing too flashy, in particular in black. Sadly, the battery is not removable. It’s a Sony, so no surprise there. What is surprising is that this design is NOT water resistant. You have to step up to the much pricier “Premium” variant for that. OS & FEATURES Having had Sony phones and tablets before, everything felt very familiar. And coming from a stock android 6.0.1 phone, everything is very natural and easy to find. The menus are all where they should be with many small, yet noticeable, Sony tweaks here and there. Such as making the main Settings menu and app drawer easier to navigate. I keep finding nice touches here and there as I explore the UI. One noteworthy feature is the addition of Themes, which are accessible with the Widgets & Wallpaper settings. Sony also has their STAMINA mode which adds considerable battery life to the phone. It’s similar to what Google has recently added to Marshmallow in that it disables extra functionality and features to really stretch out runtime. Sadly, there is a bit of bloatware in the form of Sony & 3rd party apps, which you generally can’t remove. Once disabled/hidden, it’s easy enough to pretend it’s not there. I just wish you could remove them. While I’m a big fan of 100% stock Android and faster updates, I’ll gladly take the extras if basic performance & functionality doesn’t take a hit. Which is exactly the case here. There's enough usable and practical features that I like to make it worth it. As noted, at the time of this review, Sony has the latest and greatest 6.0.1 Android OS. PERFORMANCE Stutter and lag are some of the most annoying things in a phone. I’ve sold phones for this reason in the past. As noted in the OS section above, the user interface runs great. While the Snapdragon 650 isn’t the latest 800 series you typically see in “flagship” devices, it seems to handle most tasks just fine. I’m not big on synthetic benchmarks for phones these days, but I do still feel they hold at least some value as another data point for comparison. AnTuTu Benchmark v6.1.4 - 77028 Geekbench 3: Single-Core - 1404 Multi-Core - 3803 Quadrant Standard - 29402 3DMARK: Sling Shot using ES 3.1 - 873 Vellamo Mobile Benchmark 3.2: Browser - 4673 Metal - 2392 Multicore (beta) - 2429 These look pretty good, with GPU-related scores tending to being the lowest. Although keep in mind a bunch of numbers mean nothing if real-world performance suffers. Swiping, pinching, opening/closing apps, are all nice and smooth. Right on-par with my stock Google Nexus 6. The only time I noticed a bit of sluggishness is when updates, downloads, or other similar task were running in the background Gaming is always a good example of real-world performance. It’s the primary task most folks are going to do that really pushes the CPU. I played several games including SimCity, Anomaly KR, Asphalt 8, and many others. SimCity had a bit more stuttering than I’d like, although I’ve seen this on other high-end devices. The others ran just fine and looked great; no indication that details were being lowered. This is partly due to only having to run at 1080p. More on that later. Do note that if pushed, the phone does get a bit warm. In particular when going through the initial setup, downloading a bunch of apps, etc. That seems to be the norm with the latest high-end chips. The camera did once note that it was disabling some features due to heat. That hasn’t happened again, and overall, a minor issue. DISPLAY After having used so many OLED displays, it’s often difficult going back to a “normal” IPS LCD. However, the 5” 1080p IPS Display on the Xperia X looks excellent. In fact, right next to my OLED Nexus 6 and Galaxy S5, the Sony puts them to shame. Solid black levels (if not quite OLED), sharp images, great viewing angles, no light bleed, etc. Colors can appear a tad over saturated at the higher brightness levels, but there are display adjustments for that. Honestly, it’s just a nice screen to look at it. With many cheaper IPS panels, you really do notice lesser screen quality and poor black levels compared to the newer IPS/OLED displays. Not so here. Yes, even with “only” 1080p resolution. On this 5” panel, nobody is going to miss those pixels unless you have it right in front of you face. Sony has always been commended and known for good quality IPS panels, and they continue to raise the bar. Color temperature is fairly well balanced, with whites appearing neutral. There’s also a white balance option if you prefer something a bit different. Auto brightness was disabled by default, which is how I usually like it. I turned it on to see how it worked, and it did so well, I’ve been leaving it enabled. Mostly due to the adjustment slide which determines how aggressive it kicks in. CAMERA Sony has always been known for making excellent cameras sensors that other manufactures use. Even though historically, the overall camera solution has been hit or miss on their own phones. Usually blamed on the software side of things. The 13MP camera with 22mm wide-angle lense works quite well here. It’s wide enough to capture much more of the scene while not having any fishbowl effect. Especially when compared to traditional camera lenses. Now I find the camera on my other phones inadequate in this regard. I won’t go into all of the extra camera features. If you’ve used a modern smartphone, it's got those features, plus a few fun Sony features to keep things interesting. Including a separate AR app that adds special effects and themes to your pictures. But let’s face it, other than the occasional panoramic shot, most of us are going to stick with automatic. Which we compared in multiple side-by-side pictures from our other phones. And it works great, regardless of shooting conditions. Unfortunately there is no Optical Image Stabilization, but the software stabilization seems to work pretty well, if not quite OIS levels. There weren’t many issues capturing indoor shots of my super active kids running around. Which is made even easier with the external camera button that’s always there, ready to open the camera app, quickly focus, and take that quick shot. My biggest gripe is that the camera sensor is pushed way in the corner, making it very easy for your finger to block. So expect to break some habits if your finger naturally gravitates to that area. Same goes for the front camera. It’s at the edge, which I also found myself coverup for those selfie shots. Which by the way, look far better than many rear facing cameras. It’s actually pretty darn good in any situation not requiring a flash. BATTERY This is one of those features that seems to be at the bottom of the list for phone manufactures who are more interested in making phones as thin as physically possible. However, the 2620mAh battery combined with some helpful software improvements means you’ll likely get better than average battery life, as I did. In my use, I was easily seeing 4+ hours screen-on time, and could easily last an entire day with moderate usage. That’s a little over half brightness, watching videos, surfing, a game here and there, all radios enabled, etc. Your mileage will absolutely vary. And even with that said, I do still wish the battery was a tad larger. As with most phones, if you decide to really push it, such as high brightness, lots of screen-on time, a high-end game running, you’ll still be looking for a charger by dinner time. As expected, you do have fast charging at your disposal. I just prefer to avoid the cord until bed time. Less aggressive users should do just fine, however. Even I was using the phone much more than usual just to stress test it and see how the battery fares. The relatively smaller screen size combined with fewer pixels to push do help a lot. I’m probably just being picky, but I love big batteries. And it’s still noticeably better than the Galaxy S5/6 and Nexus 6. And let’s not dismiss fast charging too quickly, as it is present, and works quite well to top off the battery in no time at all. Just don’t expect wireless charging here. SOUND There are two speakers, and they’re on the front. You know, right where they should be. Fortunately Sony continues to avoid common industry trends to shove speakers on the back/bottom where they are easily blocked. This placement is perfect for watching youtube and playing games. With that said, the speakers could sound better. Even though total volume isn’t an issue, it can sound a bit tiny, and doesn’t have as much depth as I would like. At least you’ve got good stereo separation and still sounds decent. I’ll take this over a higher quality rear-facing speaker any day. NETWORK/CARRIER USAGE I have AT&T and T-Mobile SIMs which are used in many other phones I have laying around. As in typical Sony fashion, these phones are factory unlocked and have virtually all of the LTE bands you could want for a GSM carrier. Sorry, no CDMA support here (i.e. No Verizon/Sprint). Supporting all of the latest and greatest bands is key in ensuring you’ve got full coverage for your carrier, regardless of geographical location. Meaning I’ve got lots of bars and excellent transfer rates for both carriers; right on par with my other carrier branded devices. For some reason Wi-Fi wasn’t quite as speedy as expected, only hitting around 200 Mbps max on my 802.11n 5Ghz band, if not slower at times. That was about 10 feet away from the router, in another room. From the same location, my Nexus 6 and Galaxy Tab S2 hit over 350-400 Mbps, which is pretty close to the max potential for this Wi-Fi router; and where notebooks tend to be at as well. Perhaps Sony doesn’t like my Netgear AC1750 access point; in which case it’s on it’s own since everything else loves it. If you do a ton of transfers over wi-fi, that may be an issue. Otherwise, a minor, but notable test result. CONCLUSION If this phone had a larger battery and was water resistant, it would be nearly perfect in my mind. But I’m afraid no phone is. So I simply look for one that has most of the important stuff covered. And I have to say, the Sony Xperia X gets surprisingly close. The biggest hit is the missing water resistance (a staple of many Sony gadgets), which I feel should be included at the list price. And the other cons? Well, let’s face it, they’re few and relatively minor. In fact, if the screen were larger, it could easily replace the N6 as a my daily driver. For now, it will be my #2 phone, which joins many phones I keep around. I use various phones for different purposes (work/personal/burner/testing). Overall, if you can find it below list price (as it is now), I consider this phone recommended for those in the market for a 5” near-high-end smartphone that can pretty much do it all. 4.3 stars.",30,"Sony"
"754","B01FJT7N4W",1,"true","It didn’t the pressure test in android engineering model itself.The rear camera has a big problem. In low light and dark condition, the camera just doesn’t work, and the screen keeps showing blue noise-dot. Many support softwares, such as z-device-test and MyAndroid, can’t detect the camera info. When i use Antutu, it shows the rear camera is a 8.3 mega pixel camera. Related to the pressure test, i think the phone might be a assembled phone or a personally refurbished phone. The rom is a third-party rom, not the us original version. And the IMEI is worrg too. So i think it might be a assembled phone, and somehow it goes into Amazon factory.",7,"Sony"
"755","B01FJT7N4W",5,"false","Now that I have had the Sony Xperia X for a month, I can honestly say that it is a solid mid-range phone. Coming from a Asus Zenfone 2 Laser, I am not disappointed with this phone. There could be some better options for the same price range but this by no means is a bad purchase. Pros: * Screen: the FHD is good and I was a bit worried about the IPS screen because they tend not to be as sharp looking as AMOLEDS but Sony has done a good job with their Triluminous displays. The slightly curved edges also adds to the premium look. * Support/Updates: it took forever but the phone immediately updated to Android Nougat and I have since gotten other updates so Sony is continuing to support this phone. In fact, I have gotten the monthly Android security updates which I have never gotten with other brands. * Camera Button: It is rare to find a phone with a physical camera button so this was a nice addition. * Camera: The phone takes very sharp pictures & videos. I have read reviews that said the default 8MP look better than the maxed out 23MP but so far both are sufficient for my basic photo needs. * Specs: FHD screen, Wi-Fi AC, 3 GB RAM & 6-series processor are solid mid-range specs and the phone is pretty snappy; even the boot up is relatively quick. * Speakers: Duo front-facing speakers are rare and a nice touch. * Quick Charge: An ideal feature for those of us who are always on the go. The battery life seems average so no complaints. * Music Player: Very customizable with Bass Boost, Surround Sound and more. * Exclusivity: I like being the only person around with a Sony phone. Cons: * Screen: The curved edges makes it very hard to find a screen protector. All the ones I found were cut short to avoid the curve but that affects the screen visibility. Therefore, I went with the liquid glass protector which is a bit on the expensive side. Also, most documentation says that it is scratch-resistant which makes me doubt that it has Gorilla Glass so a protector is even more important. * Customization: compared to my Zenfone, Sony does not let you alter much. I like having a black background with my Apps but there is no changing colors other than the music app. * Buttons: Having the volume so near the camera button is a bit awkward. I suspect it was to make zooming easier for one-handed selfies but I would have preferred them higher or on the other side. * Bloatware: There are some that cannot be uninstalled but it is in a manageable amount. * Bezels: Sony has long had a love affair with top & bottom bezels; this phone has gotten better but they are still on the large side * Fingerprint Scanner: No idea why Sony disabled this for the American market but it would have been nice to have Ramblings: * The NFC has a bubble sticker on the front of the phone, be sure to remove it; it is not part of the phone. * The phone is not worth the ~$500 it cost at launch but a year later, you can get it for 50% off which makes it a pretty good deal. * Sony calls the phone black but it is gray or silver, definitely not black * This phone has a nano-SIM, so if you are like me you had to replace your micro-SIM * It has a micro-USB charging port which was ideal for me because I have several of those lying around; not looking forward to having to build my USB Type-C charger collection once the micro falls out of fashion",1,"Sony"

"775","B01FJT7N4W",4,"true","Excellent: Camera: This phone has the best front camera I've ever used in a phone, main camera is also a bless (please consider I have had the galaxy S7, Iphone 6s and much more), I could take low light pictures and people wouldn't know about the low light conditions of when the picture was taken; same goes for videos, image stabilization while recording videos is THE BEST ONE in a cellphone yet. Battery: I use my phone continuously during 3 hours in the morning, 6 hours in the evening and idle during 9 hours of the day, before I go to sleep the phone would have around 25%-35% and if you want to fully charge it, it is not going to take you even an hour to fully charge it. It has happened to me that I fall asleep and would forget to charge my phone, so when I wake up I connect it to the charger while I'm taking a bath to start my day and the battery will go to around 50-70% of its full charge and will allow me to complete my day if I don't use it that much. Average: Sound, you will be able to listen to your voice notes and videos, but it is not going to be a surrounding song or beating sound, would say average. The bad: This phone is extremely slow compared to the galaxy S7 or an Iphone 6S, what it comes to play games in the phone, the phone would perform as expected, but amazingly when you try to multi task or even facebook, this phone will froze and would stop responding, you might need to power cycle the phone or press the power button, sometimes with no success. I will replace it though, for the Xperia X compact and will be posting my review on that one too.

It has crashed on me three times and froze while running basic apps and I'm not even a multi app running type of user.

"792","B01FJT7N4W",5,"true","Having tried almost every recent Sony Xperia phone in the past 3 years or so, this is by far one of the best since the Xperia Z3 Compact. It's faster than the Z5 series (Antutu and everyday usage). Snappy, no lag, camera is soon much quicker and better photos. And unless you really want the water proofing or care for benchmarks, no reason to get the thicker and bulkier X Performance variant. I don't do games on the phone so the processor is more than enough and feels just as fast as any other phone in daily usage. The screen and design puts it on the same level as other flagships. Curved and flush with the bezels, smooth and feels premium. I have an iPhone 6S as well and I finally feel the Sony has that same polished and feel when you hold it in your hand. Price could be a little cheaper but Sony is always a little pricier than others. Size is a perfect balance I think between bulky 5.5+ phones and smaller 4.x phones.",16,"Sony"

Also, they don't have too much bloatware, which is a huge annoyance. The power was decent and the screen was nice. The problem is that less than a month into use, it started going nuts. Probably something went wrong with the digitizer or the OS. It just started entering random commands and presses and the phone became unusable. So, I exchanged immediately.

Processing speed is quick and the slim attention to detail oriented design fits great in the hand & of course looks polished as well.

"803","B01LXF0WML",5,"true","When I first took the phone out of the box, the default system language was Chinese. This is easily fixed by going to settings. If you're not sure how to change the language, there's probably instructions on YouTube or something. If you've had an android device before though, you should have an approximate idea of where those settings are. Anyways! This phone is beautiful. I really love the pink color. Since this is an international version, the fingerprint scanner is enabled. The fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurate! The only problem with ordering this device is that depending on where you live, the wall adapter you use to charge the phone might not fit into your wall. I know mine didn't. Luckily I had the adapter from my old Xperia, but if you don't have a spare Sony adapter for an Xperia device, I highly recommend you get one, since if this is anything like my other device, any other adapter than the one that came with the phone will make it charge much slower. My old Xperia would take 12 hours to fully charge from a dead battery when I didn't use the adapter. Now, since THIS Xperia is different and uses USB type C, this might no longer be the case. But just to be safe, I'd order an adapter as well. This phone is just the right size too! It's not HUGE, so you can keep it in your shirt pocket and not worry about it falling out or anything! The Xperia XA Ultra was a bit too big sometimes. It used to fall out of my pockets, and one handed use was nearly impossible with that thing. This is a fantastic phone, and I really love it so far! ♥",9,"Sony"

"815","B01LXF0WML",2,"true","It's an okay phone. Was definitely not worth the 700 I payed for and it shows with how often this is on sale. Having two front facing speakers is great but they're very weak and muddy. Screen is perfect size for my hands although I would prefer an OLED or 1440p for this price and it has a bit of a ghosting effect. Camera is pretty garbage for the price. Better than most but not ""flagship"" quality. Amazing how Sony decided to use one of their own meh sensors for their flagship when one of their competitors, the google pixel, used a much better sony sensor. Even with the 23MP camera it doesnt look as good as the Pixel's. You can forget about nightshots or even low light shots as well. Havent had an issue with the 3GB of ram myself but I do find that decision odd and having some breathing room would always be better. Not all negative though: the design, as always, is pretty great. Sony always has good looking phones. Although with the sides being rounded glossy plastic it is very slippery. I like the thumbprint reader as well. Not always accurate and not as fast as others but it works. Battery drain is pretty good. Most get around 5.5 SoT but i've been pushing around 7ish. Water-resistance is awesome too, shame that's probably what affected the speakers though. All in all, Ill continue to use this phone but I dont plan on ever trying out a Sony again.",3,"Sony"

It is difficult to find a case that looks good and protects fully, but that's what we get for wanting a relatively obscure device. My only gripe about the phone itself is that finger print scanner can be a tiny bit hit or miss, but I found adding the same finger multiple times allow for fluid use of this feature. Lastly, I would say I'm extremely disappointed in the glass screen protector options for this phone due to the slightly curved edges of the screen, but I place blame on the third party screen protector manufacturing than on the Sony. All in all, a fantastic device, extremely pleased with its prefrmace, and selfies have never been so horrifically high res.",10,"Sony"

For example, when I'm picking it from a table, it is my index finger that gets to the sensor so I have added it. The camera is great especially when used in manual mode, but you have to master it.

"843","B01LXF0WML",3,"true","Moved from a Motorola G3 so this was a big move up for me. I was looking for a good phone with a solid camera and video capable. Sony delivered with this phone. The phone is thin, feels solid, produces great photos and has an amazing display. Very happy so far! Update: After owning just a few months, some weaknesses showed up. The glass is delicate, like an eggshell. Even with a gorilla glass protective shield, a slight drop cracked the glass.. shattered. My 200.00 Motorola never did that. Second thing, the 4k on mine worker marginally. The color was way off and it would overheat and shut off after very short vid clips. Very displeased because I literally bought it for the name and the 4k capability but the quality just wasn't there. Maybe I got the exception but for me, not worth the price. Changing from 5 stars to 3, Sorry.",NA,"Sony"

"845","B01LXF0WML",2,"true","Very disappointed with this phone. Bought it in May, and almost immediately I noticed it seemed slower than it should be for a fresh phone. It's only gotten worse over time. If I can't stream a podcast while browsing Facebook smoothly, that's a big problem. Also, the battery is garbage as well. If I'm lucky I'll get maybe 8-10 hours out of it if I'm using it moderately. Totally unacceptable. If it barely lasts for my work shift, there's something wrong with the phone. Also, as others have noted, there have been times where the phone has been so laggy that I've missed phone calls or had to let them ring for 5-10 seconds before being able to answer. This is simply not doable for the main function of the device. I don't know how ""refurbished"" this phone really was. Overall I would not recommend it. I really got it so that I could remote play my PS4 games on it, but the fact that you can't even do that without being on WiFi kind of kills it.",NA,"Sony"

Let me tell you why. I thought that coming from an old phone (Iphone 6s is almost 2 years old now) to this one would be good idea. However, the phone got to me with dead pixels from a seller who was not helpful at all, as dead pixels where in the lower left corner they were barely noticeable. So, we are talking a brand new phone that already had problems and I had to keep. > My Facebook and instagram apps will crash all the time, phone was terribly slow...sometimes the applications will stop working and would ask me if I wanted to close the app or wait. > Camera quality was terrible, I had the Xperia Z3 Compact and that phone has a better camera than this one does. > No guys, I am not an apple fan and this is not a comparison between the iphone 6s I had and this phone BUT I swear this phone is way behind than the Iphone 6s or any other phone I've tried in the last couple years. the performance is more than horrible, it's frustrating. > Thumbs up for battery: By the end of the day I would have from 50 to 60% battery left. > It's heavy, difficult to hold for people with small hands (like me). > Audio is soooo low that you can't have a call on speaker while driving because you won't hear well. I ended up buying a Huawei P10 and I am happy with my purchase. Huawei P10 is better than both Iphone 6S and Xperia XZ.

"886","B01LXF0WML",4,"true","I last had an Android phone sometime around seven or eight years ago. It sucked. The interface was ugly, and the thing crashed constantly; I had to pop the battery out for a hard reset every couple of days, on average. The Samsung design was cheap-looking and boring. As a result, I did the NOKIA/Windows Phone thing for several years, and largely loved it. Loved the solidity and ease of the interface, and definitely loved the simple, elegant ""slab"" design of the devices. Sadly, they ran that thing into the ground, in terms of the ecosystem, and it was eventually time to replace my phone (though well designed overall, the USB jack started failing). Despite middling reviews, I was immediately set on getting this newer Sony phone. It's just beautiful to look at, fitting my slabby tastes to a T. I took a gamble, on the hunch that professional phone/tech reviewers tend to make up silly distinctions (nit-picking screen resolutions well past human visual acuity, for instance) in order to justify their jobs. Turns out, it's a very, very nice phone. It's plenty fast, runs cool, and doesn't ever crash. The battery life could be better, but it charges rapidly and ""intelligently"" so that shouldn't be an issue for many people. Feels just right in my hand (a bit of comfy weight) and seems to be robustly built. The colors are uniquely subtle and fit the design perfectly. The only area where the device comes up short is the camera. I have no idea why Sony hypes this angle of the phone so heavily; there's nothing special about the images, and in fact I would largely say they've been sub-par. Some sort of auto-sharpening filter is applied to everything, making those 20+ MP pictures look weirdly muddy (almost like a ""paint"" effect, on a small scale). This is particularly disappointing because Sony helps other manufacturers on the camera front, and makes highly-competitive actual-cameras as well. I own -- and love -- a couple of these models, myself, which is good because I can ignore the crummy camera on the phone. But anyway; If portable imagery is a key component of your phone, you'll absolutely be happier with a different model.",2,"Sony"
"887","B01LXF0WML",4,"true","The phone it's working just fine, only issue is that it discharges kind of fast, but for the rest it's pretty good. I do miss the more metallic look of previous Xperia like the Z3 I owned. The back of the phone had scratched slightly after putting in pocket",NA,"Sony"
"888","B01LXF0WML",2,"true","The camera is horrible. Everything else is fine. I am not even close to being a photo fanatic, and I am extremely surprised that I find the camera horrible. I am coming from iphones from 3g to 6s, and then lumia 950, never ever thought that in this day and age a camera could produce such bad pictures. Edit: Downgrading to 2 stars. After the Nougat update, the battery life became a joke - 3-4 hours when using the GPS on the road. Both this and the above camera issue have been discussed in great lengths on the official Sony forum, to no avail. Eventually, the phone pissed me off to the extent that I smashed it against my car dashboard :) Waiting for an Honor 8 now...",1,"Sony"

"891","B01LXF0WML",5,"false","I did not purchase the phone from Amazon. I bought it through ebay. But since its the same model F8332, wanted to share my review. I bought the Forest Blue model 64gb Dual Sim model F8332. The particular model I have was for Hong Kong and included the Quick Charger corresponding to the region. I had a adapter included to make it compatible for North America, which works absolutely fine. In the box: My model came with the phone, documentation, USB Type C cable, Quick Charger, Adapter for North America, basic set of headphones from sony (The model F8331 usually doesn't include it). Experience: I have been using my phone for over a month now. It is really good having migrated from my Xperia Z3. The 3 standout features are 1) The Display -Excellent with wide viewing angles, ample back light with a good light sensor to help you read clearly even in sunlight when you have ambient light sensor on. The gorilla glass 4 gives me a slight peace of mind that it wont scratch easily. You can go for tampered glass screen protectors (Find ones which are curved on the sides), but I decided not to go for it. I paid around $40 extra to get the SCTF10 Touch cover. It's expensive, but offers really good protection and is available in colors of the phone. It is super light and doesn't add bulk to the phone. The touch cover is really good. I hardly open the cover unless I have to do intensive typing like answering emails OR for playing games. For simple replies to text messages, going through twitter n facebook, calling etc. you can keep the touch cover on and do your daily tasks. The phone lets you adapt to the touch cover with appropriate level of sensitivity and light settings with the cover on. I highly RECOMMEND getting the SCTF10 even though it is a bit expensive. 2) Camera quality: The biggest upgrade coming over from Xperia Z3 i the camera. Snappy, a lot better low light performance and manual controls make it as really excellent camera. Look for unbiased reviews on youtube and you will find that the Xperia XZ is among the top 3 smartphones in terms of camera and picture quality with the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7. All 3 have their pros and cons, but overall I am really happy with the camera. Check my instagram page to get a glimpse (@intellix). I love shooting the light trails with the manual shutter speed control. Also selfies are a lot better now in low light with support for gestures (My Xperia Z3 was horrible in low light). The color balance in images is neutral (instead of being too warm and punchy) which I prefer since I like to customize my images. Sony claims in their advertisements that the colors are true to life and you should use #nofilter which seems to be really the case. I just love the camera as of now. Although it doesn't have a 2x zoom like the Iphone 7 plus, overall the images taken with the manual mode are really nice with all the customization options available. The auto mode is pretty good as well specially in daylight. It will suffer a bit in low light. I would recommend users to use the scene selection mode in manual mode with low light portraight or twilight mode for low light scenarios. Also play with the shutter speed. By reducing the shutter speed just a little bit, images turn out to be 10 times better even in dark. To summarize, the CAMERA is at par with the ABSOLUTE BEST in all conditions. 3. Audio quality: In general like previous Sony phones, the audio quality is excellent. Turn ON the DSEE HX for getting High Resolution audio if you are using wired headphones. It is an absolutely splendid experience. Wireless music is at par as well. The blutooth audio settings give you the option to select between quality and performance, letting you choose whether you would prefer continuous connectivity VS lossless quality when blutooth device is moved away from the recipient. It is a good option to have.Overall I have tried the iphone, Moto G and previously a lot of sony phones. I simply think that the Music app of Sony(Previously known as Walkman) is the best of the lot. In terms of volume of the speaker, the speaker volume is a lot louder than the Z3 but it could have been louder when compared with the iphone 7, galaxy s7 or other flagship phones. Overall I am not disappointed since I don't use the speaker phone often. The audio output from the 3.5mm jack on external systems is really good now. Previously we have witnessed problems with audio output on Sony flagships. Overall: The dual sim option where the 2nd slot is a hybrid sim slot for microsd card or nano sim is a really important option for users like me who travel a lot. I tend to use the 2nd sim slot when I travel internationally while for day to day use, I usually keep my 64GB MicroSd card for my photographs. The 64gb internal memory is a big boost from 16GB models that sony produced earlier. Another nice gesture is the option to move data of the apps to SD card which I believe only Sony still supports, although I may be wrong. It proved to be a life saver time and often when I used my 16GB Xperia Z3. The fingerprint scanner is snappy and accurate. I just love it when folks take my phone and get confused as to where the fingerprint reader is ..lol So, I'd definitely recommend this phone. Go for it. You will not be disappointed.",1,"Sony"

"931","B01LXF0WML",1,"true","I've been a Sony/Sony-Ericsson user for over 15 years, and I believe this very phone has made me change brands. Don't get me wrong, the phone is indeed as beautiful (in my opinion) as every other Xperia model I've owned. BUT it came with both harware and software problems so irritating I had to ask Amazon for a refund. Problems, I found out to late, are apparently common in this model! A mix of a faulty motherboard and bonedeep Nougat implementation issues meant the phone restarted every 5-10 minutes, making it impossible to use. I consider myself to be somewhat skilled in the use and repair of mobile phones, but this issue widely overcame me. And here comes my most important complaint: Sony Customer Support is a JOKE. Not only did they not offer a solution to the problem (after making me go over all the diagnosis tests I had already found in the many forums referring this problem), but they refused to accept this is a widespread problem among XZ units, and insisted I send it to my local repair service because it seemed indeed a hardaware malfunction (duh!). Sony's local representative turned out to be so irresponsible, impolite and incompetent I didnt't dare leave a new phone in their hands. With no other option left, and no help whatsoever form Sony, I was forced to ask Amazon for a refund, whose Support/Return Service was, oppositely, extremely polite and efficient. I was refunded after return, no questions asked. Hope this experience is helpful to anyone else thinking in buying this phone. Sony has lost a loyal customer in me.",3,"Sony"
"932","B01LXF0WML",1,"true","Just got it today. Lags when just typing, takes nearly 5 sec time for keyboard to pop out. Slow typing too. Edit: Charged it passed 5 percentage and turned off the power saving modes, now works good. What I stated above doesnt occur anymore. Almost April, so had it for a few months. Think its near trash, regret buying. Pros: 64 GB, water proof Cons: LAG LAG LAG, and slow screen which is off by about 30ms. Very noticeable for rhythm games. Battery is decent. I had iphone 5 before this and it's screen was way more responsive even though it was cracked. The iphone 5 also loads app 3x faster, and just that is enough to make me regret this purchase. I wish I spent the extra hundred on the other sony with the better processor, but then again I'm not sure if it'd be faster than the iphone 5. Even if it is, iphone 6 is at a similar price to this, and it also faster than my iphone 5. If I could, I would return this for a iphone 6 and im posting this in 2019. where I know apple makes it difficult for consumers to replace iphone parts. The iphone is just so much better in terms of performance. edit: september 51, when this device reaches an ""ambient temperature"" during recording or taking photos, it will shut off. At ambient temperature, the phone is not even hot it is just warm.

"940","B01LXF0WML",5,"true","This phone is WAY better than some of the review websites give it credit! I have the international version, which unlike the U.S. version, gives you the fingerprint sensor capability. I highly recommend this version. You do take a risk though because Sony probably will not honor a warranty repair if you need one inside the U.S.A. But the convenience of the fingerprint sensor is invaluable and worth the trade-off in the event of a defect. This phone is at the top end in terms of size when compared to most 5.2"" screens. And the squared off corners do take some getting used to. However, the materials, fit and finish are top tier (and I've had a lot of phones, both Android and iOS to compare this to). The screen blends flawlessly into the body due to its waterproof capability. The phone's case is definitely not a fingerprint magnet. The screen's color gamut is more closer to authentic to true colors than on previous Sony phones as well as many other phones out there. I found it more realistic than a Galaxy S7 I have. It's absolutely beautiful. I also like the right amount of brightness it displays, not too dim, not too bright. I had a ZTE Axon 7 that was always too dim, requiring me to brighten the display to make it more readable and pleasing to the eye. Not so with this phone. Sony's adaptive brightness feature works great. I think Sony hit the mark with this one. I can only describe the phone's speed and operation as very fluid. There are no pauses or hiccups. The Snapdragon 820 processor and Android Marshmallow are the right recipe for this phone. The back of the phone will only get very mildly warm when the phone is put through heavy processing tasks. Probably slightly less than many other premium phones I have used. I like the camera very well, although like many reviewers, it is not in the same caliber as the iPhone 7 that I also have. That camera is outstanding. This Sony has some very different color representations in photos that to me, are not very natural, like skin tones for example. The iPhone produces some very realistic skin colors. However, the Sony is still a good camera, better than on most phones. I am using this phone on AT&T in the U.S. and it works flawlessly. I consistently get LTE speed most everywhere I go. The only take away I have for this phone would be the squareness of the corners, which will take some getting used. And the fact the U.S. version does not have fingerprint sensor capabilities. Sony - come on, you need to fix this please!!! Pay what you need to pay on the necessary patents and get it done! Once they do, they have the potential to really sell some phones. Otherwise, this is a really GREAT phone and I highly recommend it.",50,"Sony"

"958","B01LXF0WML",5,"true","Very nice upgrade to the XA ultra. it fits well in your hand, relatively light and the color is conservative enough you won't grow tired of it over time. Compared to the XA ultra, this phone is much quicker to respond to touches, but the volume buttons are a little lower than expected. This could be to make zooming in camera mode easier. This appears to have been designed as a right handed phone by the button placement, but it's still comfortable to use left handed. If you are planning on using this to listen to music in the shower, you should place it face down. Otherwise water will fill the front facing speakers and it will mute the sound. My main fear with this was that since I'm in the US, when the phone updates it might disable the fingerprint scanner. Luckily that was not the case. The fingerprint scanner works much better than i expected it to. When I first heard about it, i thought it was some cheap gimmicky thing they added, but as far as I can tell, it's very quick, accurate, secure, and easy to use. (does not work when wet)",2,"Sony"
"959","B01LXF0WML",4,"true","Very happy with this amazing phone with the only drawback that it can't handle two SIMs and a microSD card at the same time because the second SIM slot is also the microSD card slot. There are reports of people overcoming this on other phones with similar slots by dangerously modifying the SD and SIM cards, merging them to fit in the slot, yet that won't work on this phone since it will disable the SD card upon detection of a SIM in the slot. Even when this phone has much more internal storage, it's not even close to a 128 or 256GB SD card you can easily use in an Xperia Z5 alongside 2 SIMs. If you absolutely want 2 SIMs, you are stuck with the fifty-something GB of internal space. It's the exact same size as the Z5, yet it has a slightly bigger and brighter screen, same excellently located and ultra-fast fingerprint sensor, it's a bit faster and overall I like the design better. Front camera is a huge improvement over the Z5's, while the main camera feels very similar, with a better focus detection. There's no denying this is as overpriced as all previous Xperia flagship phones, but if you are like me and value the design and features that only an Xperia can give you in the same package, it's absolutely worth it.",2,"Sony"

"978","B01LXF0WML",5,"true","I bought this phone to replace my Xperia Z1S from t-mobile, as they decided to not longer have Sony in their fleet (hope the fired who ever made that decision ;-). ) Anyhow, I used it while traveling for business in Mexico, England, Switzerland, Paris and of course my home the US... It doesn't matter where I was, thanks to the many bandwidth this cell comes with, I always had connections, fast online connections and 4GLTE where such networks where already available. There are only two things which is a little negative, if I use my highest settings for HD pictures or movies, the phone starts overheating when I have it in my protective cover. And the dual Sim lot, I can either use dual Sim (which I need) or have one Sim and am micro SD card for additional storage. However I never run into storage problems so far, as it comes with a generous internal storage. Would I buy it again? In a heartbeat!",4,"Sony"
"979","B01LXF0WML",5,"true","It has been 6 months and it works great for me so far. At first, there was a slowness or lagging with overheat problem. After resetting to the factory default with proper updates, it finally work stably. The battery life, camera and screen are good. Somebody may not like its bulky square shape which is Sony phone style but it is fine for me. I switched my phone from Windows phone to Android phone. This phone is the first phone for me to learn and get used to Android system. A major reason I chose this phone is it provides a dedicated camera shutting button just like Nokia Windows phone and it is a very convenient function to bring up camera quickly without looking for camera application on the screen. The international version provides fingerprint unlocking on the power button and it is another convenient design better than US version. For Android on this phone, I recommend disabling the auto update to prevent the unexpected problem from Google. There used to be a buggy ""google"" update causing malfunction on SMS text message and few weeks later another update fixed the problem. Also the new Google Play service will consume the battery power quickly so I have to uninstall the update and wait for an official version update from Sony. Without the new Google Play service installed, I can keep the phone battery lasting pretty long time although some app like AVG, Maps and Gmail can't be upgraded. In overall, this phone performs very well for me and it is my good life partner.",1,"Sony"

Sony makes very high quality phones and I greatly appreciate their approach to perfecting their signature design rather than going for the wow factor. Not that this phone doesn't wow. The fingerprint scanner on the side is perfect!! The camera is probably my least favorite thing, but it still can take great pictures.",4,"Sony"

It's really fast and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The sound as expected from Sony is clear. The camera is definitely an upgrade. I had the Z3 Compact and it has the same pixel size but there's definitely some improvement. The front camera is better but I don't know by how much with low light. So far it's definitely an upgrade from my Z3. I have yet to use the full power of the phone but so far things are going without a hitch!

The phone came in a factory sealed Xperia box and included not only the new android charging cord, but even headphones! It also came with two Japanese outlet plugs, one is a conversion for us outlets--but I still had one for the US and they're fairly inexpensive if you need one.

"989","B01LXF0WML",5,"true","This is a review of the latest Sony flagship smartphone; The Sony Xperia XZ F8332 Dual SIM international model 64GB that I bought from Gotham's Cells. Coming from having a Z5 Premium, I did choose the Forest Blue model, got it on time, sealed in box which contains Manual books USB type C cable United Kingdom wall charger (the seller was gentle enough to include an American adapter) Headphones MH410c After set up it works fine running Sony's near stock Android Marshmallow 6.0.2 with immediate option to update to Nougat it already has a FUNCTIONAL fingerprint scanner out of the box, by far this is what I think about it. Pros: - Square Sony design. - New Alkaleido metal construction. - Fingerprint scanner out of the box. - Laser Autofocus. - 5 Axis optical stabilization. - Waterproof IP68 again. - No protruding camera lens. - Front facing stereo speakers Cons: - Not big enough screen 5.2"" (vs 5.5"" Z5P) - Small battery 2900mAh (vs 3430mAh Z5P) - Awkward NFC position. But overall I'm happy with this new phone as the downsides cannot outshine the new design, features and camera which is the best of the market as its not color saturated like the Samsung and has a more realistic depth than iPhone, but you have to choose manual camera mode to get the 23 megapixels in 4:3 screen ratio because the default setting is average looking 8 megapixels, people who don't figure this out usually disqualifies Xperia cameras as not good enough. The laser autofocus system does calculate the distance from the objects being photographed and adjust the lens to take the picture more accurately and the 5 Axis optical image stabilization ensures smooth video recording even with shaky hands. The front facing speakers are good for normal use, but not party loud, for this reason people complain but they fail to understand that they're waterproof, in no way they can substitute having a separate Bluetooth speaker. Yes, I would recommend this Sony Xperia XZ F8332 international 64GB to a friend from Gotham's Cells.",13,"Sony"

"993","B01LXF0WML",4,"true","I'm quite happy with this smart phone overall, however, it needs to be mentioned that the back and sides of the phone are made of medium quality plastic, which makes the phone very vulnerable to scratches. My phone got a few mild scratches by just sitting in pocket of my soft pants, so, I suggest that you get a case for this phone prior to using it. Also, I experienced some strange behavior from my specific Xperia XZ; it happened twice in course of three days that the phone wasn't able to recognize the sim-card all of the sudden. Obviously, this issue prevented me from receiving phone calls or text messages while I wasn't aware of it. I had to restart the phone before I was able to use it in a practical manner again. Lack of scratch resistivity is not a huge deal, but the second issue makes me slightly worried, so I'm exchanging the phone with a new XZ. On my second order, I also noticed that the phone slows down quite significantly one there are multiple notifications on the lock screen!",1,"Sony"

Had the Verizon exclusive Xperia z3v for two years and was really satisfied with the product that I thoroughly sought out the next best Xperia phone out there. With the newer XZs and XZ platinum(?) debuting in the next few months, it seems the XZ has gone down in price. Originally priced at around $700 this recent price drop has made justifying such a (not so cheap) purchase easier to digest. No, this phone will not work with Verizon, and as much as I want to stay with the best network in the USA I won't go through another 2 year phone contract with a device I really do not like (sorry Motorola but I'm just not that fancy). Great looking phone, runs buttery smooth. Camera app opens quick and takes amazing phone pictures. Not an iPhone but still amazing (up to) 23MP. Somehow when you zoom in on an already pretty looking photo, the details get grainy.. But I'm no photographer so I can easily get past this minor gripe. International version means finger print enabled without flashing required. No warranty so don't drop this phone. Don't get too caught up on the spec sheet. This device may seem inferior to the 4 or 6GB RAM other phones boast, or any of the other niceties they all offer-- it seems Sony has tinkered with enough tech over its 50+ year life to know how to make best use of the hardware to complement whatever software is offered. Family, friends, coworkers are all impressed with this gorgeous device claiming they've never seen one like it. On the other side, accessories such as covers are very limited. Had to order from UK vendor-- but then again, that service was also satisfactory. Wish Sony phones were readily available to the US market. Would recommend to you (whoever read this far).

I received the phone on 11/3/2016, the invoice/receipt (from authorized Sony Taiwan store) was also included in the package. It means you get one year warranty from Sony mobile in Taiwan (in case that make a difference for you). Taiwan is one of the biggest market for Sony Mobile and Sony usually packs extra features on their phone released in Taiwan compare to US (which is one of the main reason I decided to get one from Taiwan). Xperia XZ box is sealed as shown in the picture. This is a Sony F8332 phone with dual SIM and 64 GB internal storage (US version is only 32 GB in storage). Following are included int the box: 1. Sony F8332 mobile phone 2. Sony MH410c earphone 3. Sony AC-0051-TW 2700mA USB charger 4. Sony UCB20 USB type C cable Since this is Taiwan version of XZ, fingerprint scanner is enabled right out of box (no need to root like US version). Dual SIM card works well which can be easily controlled via settings menu. Currently I am using T-mobile nano SIM with 128GB Sandisk micro SD card which boast total storage to almost 200 GB. Quick speed test on the T-mobile network yields around 36 Mbps near my home. Note: 4G+ on the screen capture is equivalent to US LTE+ (as other countries use 4G to indicate LTE). Xperia's OS is very close to vanilla android and currently XZ is on Android 6.0.1 This is a solid choice if you are looking for a different choice compare to normal Samsung S7, LG G5 and HTC 10 (or even iPhone 7/7 plus for iOS)",39,"Sony"

"1026","B01LXF0WML",3,"true","Just got this phone on 03/03/2017. Love everything about it. First you thing notice is how it feels in your hand. Very light, feels really good. Everything is balance, the weight are distributed evenly on all sides. Navigating through the phone is very smooth and fluid. There are no hiccups. I have the Sony Z3 and still have it and I love that phone. The XZ is a huge upgrade. Most of all, I'm very happy with the phone. However, there are things I'm really disappointed at. In doing screen quality comparison. The white on this phone is warm white and have that yellowish tint to it. No matter how much setting I play using X-Reality or Super-vivid, it still have that yellow. The Z3 is pure white, like a cool white. When comparing pictures, pictures are overblown and saturated. It totally change the feeling of the scene especially for landscape pictures. Grass are not true green but washed out. Too much stuff at play and not relaxing and pleasing to the eyes. Who knows, maybe the Z3 have the glass screen protector and it filter out some gamma lights. Still, I'm very disappointed. My Z3 still looks better. My biggest complaint and this might be a deal breaker. The dam battery is very poor. It goes down 1% every 3-5 minutes. I would use the phone just browsing the web and reading news article, in 10 minutes, it's already 90%. My Sony Z3 would be like 95%-97% in that period of time doing the same thing. Yes, I know the battery only have 2.9k mah compare to Z3 3.0k+ mah but still, that's just insane to see battery going down like that. Or maybe it have to do with Z3 running custom rom and Marshmallow. Which means I have more control of what apps are running in the background that's draining the battery.

"1029","B01LXF0WML",4,"false","I bought this phone for my trip to Japan, because I was told the phone had a particularly great camera, and well, it's Sony. Haha. Well Sony does many things right with this phone, and some things... Not so much. Let's start with the fact that I actually bought the USA version, which does not come shipped with a working finger print sensor. In 2016, a finger print sensor isn't a luxury anymore, it's expected. Other than this one mishap though, the phone performs fairly well. Camera: The camera is about what you'd expect from the likes of Sony. Beautiful. In Japan, I lived with students from all over the world for about a year, and only one of them had a camera that could best mine. The newer Sony XZ Premium. The camera quality on this phone is superb, and that camera button is such a treat to use. Battery Life: The phone doesn't get amazing battery life, but it's not terrible either. I was getting about a day of moderate to heavy use with mine. Although the battery life in general is so, so, the phone does have a neat smart charging feature however, where the phone will over the course of 2 weeks or so monitor your charging routine and adjust to it to help prevent battery deterioration. I would usually charge mine over night (like most people I assume) and the phone would read out 98 - 99% early in the morning, just getting to 100% by the time I was ready to take it off the charger. Neat feature, Sony. Screen: Again, about what you'd expect from Sony. Stunning. For an IPS display panel, you won't find a better screen display on a phone than with Sony. The colors are bright and vibrant, and the darks are about as dark as you can get with IPS technology. Plus you can customize how vibrant or natural you want the screen colors to be for yourself, as well as adjust the white balance. Speakers: Yet again, amazing quality. Sony put two, loud front facing speakers on this phone, and they are amazing! The sound quality is crisp, with great high's, and nice base. The only thing about the speakers is when I compared them with my Australian friend's Motorola phone (which also boasted similar front facing speakers), the volume on hers got much louder. I'd say the sound quality on the Sony speakers might be slightly better than the Motorola's, however the difference was negligeble. Performance: I won't leave much here. The phone is about as fast as you might expect a premium phone of 2016 to be. WIth the latest chipset from snapdragon onboard you won't be disapointed with the speed. Sony does have a unique gaming experience with their phones though. With Playstation play anywhere app (only for Sony phones), you can play streamed games right from your playstation to the phone. It's a pretty neat feature with no noticeable lag during gameplay. Attach a bluetooth controller to the phone and blast the front facing speakers, and you're gonna have a great time. This is an awesome gaming phone. Audio: This phone makes for a great mp3 player as well. Sony packs a powerful DAC audio performance in the phone for connected headphones, and once enabled the change is very noticeable, well done Sony. (Now I never tried this feature with bluetooth headphones, so I don't know if it'll work with them, but it works great with corded ones).",NA,"Sony"

"1034","B01LXF0WML",4,"false","Needless to say, this is a much better version than the US one. The, very reliable, fingerprint scanner & 64 GB of internal memory make a big difference. To the review,,,I had the chance to use three flagship phones in the past few months, so I'll try to be as unbiased as possible. I had the htc 10 & the Note 7, yup the one that supposedly explodes all the time, and this Sony. Compared to the other two, the Sony is definitely better than the htc but not as good as the Note 7. Some Quick points: Camera: really good, but Sony could have done better. It's a good overall camera, but nothing specially impressive about it & that's the problem with this phone, it's a solid phone with an amazing screen but nothing really impressive about it! Screen: The reason why I'm keeping the phone! It might be ""just""full HD, but work a 5.2"" it's really gr8, colors are vibrant and watching videos is really fun on this phone. Design: Sony made a beautiful phone & the dark blue feels really premium, but there's still something missing here, it's not catchy, unlike the htc 10 & the Note 7 nothing about it screams flagship. But the phone is very slim & light, very comfortable in my average sized hands. Speakers: while having front speakers is generally a good idea, the speakers on this phone are on the quieter side. Battery: Average. Lasts almost all day with ""regular""use with Stamina mode activated. But if u want hourly weather updates with a fancy live wallpaper & ur using location all the time, it sure won't be enough. One thing I really didn't like was the large footprint, at this time& age, the phone should have a screen that takes the whole phone real estate. And the lack of a physical button despite that extra plastic part at the bottom is a little annoying. One thing I liked though is the physical camera button, brings back some nostalgia, Nokia phones anyone?! and it comes in handy sometimes. So a star off for the not.too.bad, not.too.great camera, average battery & the lack of a physical button with a larger footprint. Am I keeping this phone? Yes! Is it the Note 7 replacement? Not really. But it's a really better phone than almost all the others right now at this price range, may be except for the S7 edge. So if u don't mind buying a phone that's few months old, then get the S7 edge, if not, then this Sony is for you!",2,"Sony"

Although there is some learning curve going from iOS to Android, she is picking it up pretty quickly. She was also able to easily move her contacts, photos, files and everything else pretty easily, with the exception of her iTunes library. This is not easy, and may be impossible, so it is something you should consider when changing OS platforms. Her purchased library was not that big, so she decided it was definitely worth it. The phone is very fast, and download speeds seem to rival wired internet connections (we are on T-Mobile with LTE). The camera is pretty good, but I have to admit that it does not do as well in low light. You get pictures OK, but they seem pixellated on the screen when you go to look at them. The main bonus with this phone is that it seems to have bottomless memory, which is important for us. The Android OS has also been great for translating to various foreign languages, and we routinely use the phone as a hotspot for our daughter's iPad when we are driving. It really is what you want a phone to be. Be careful of games that eat batteries though (as is true with any phone).",6,"Sony"

However it is far way better than my previous xperia Z2 Marshmellow 6.0. If you previously held a lollipop, the permissions are going to get you on your nerves but you can manage it Quiet expensive but considering it is a new phone, it is almost worth the price How you can get the fingerprint scanner? You can buy an international version which I didn't find convenient or you can follow this [...] The fingerprint scanner is a software limitation only and you can flash it to get the fingerprint enabled, same way as I did with the UK version. Does it void your warranty? Only if you root it and UNLOCK the bootloader of the phone. Flashing a sotware is like installing and update, but unlocking the bootloader is not and you don't have to do it to get the fingerprint scanner In general, it is a good phone and if you think that you need t buy an international version only to get the scanner you might be wrong",31,"Sony"

"1057","B01M1HY1E3",4,"true","My previous phone was a Note 4, so after playing around on this phone for a while, these are my first thoughts. The power/lock/unlock button is in a really convenient place considering it's in the middle of the phone. It makes it easier to turn on and off without having to readjust your hand which is nice. The volume button took a little getting used to but it turned out better then expected. Although the speakers aren't as loud as my note 4, having both of the speakers in the front of the phone is a lot nicer, no need to cup my hand around to hear videos. I don't use a lot of apps, and this phone works faster then my last one, and the battery lasts a while, about 1-2 days before needing to charge. The screen is also very clear and crisp. One thing I don't like is that you have to use your typing on their SwiftKey keyboard with auto suggest which I personally find annoying. The key highlight for the phone is their camera. You can take photos ranging from 8mp to 20mp, (24mp in 4:3 aspect ratio). The lens has a wider angle then most cellphones which is really nice when taking landscape photos, or taking a pic of a bunch of people. Taking action shots is the most incredible I have yet seen in any cellphone camera. The colors as advertised are near identical to real life color as well, without editing. The video in 1080p is really clear, and has a wider angle then I had previously thought. The 4K feature is a little disappointing. Although it may be slightly clearer then the 1080p, you lose a lot of the picture angle when you use it, which isn't worth it to me. Let me know if this review was helpful",16,"Sony"

Physically, the XZ has a nice, sleek, design (as expected of Sony) with a large screen but is still easy to hold and operate with one hand (unlike some of the other large screen smartphones on the market). Touchscreen responsivity is great, camera quality (23 MP for the main camera) is top notch, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor provides excellent operating speeds, and I haven't had any problems with network reception or internet connectivity. I use a pay-as-you-go plan on the AT&T network.

"1071","B01M1HY1E3",3,"true","The Xperia XZ is truly a beautiful device. While the ""slab"" appearance my turn some people off, it's very comfortable to hold, and is narrow enough that it never feels like it's about to fly from your hand. The display, while not mind-boggling in terms of specs, borrows heavily from Sony's television expertise, and looks more ""natural"" playing HD movies than the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7 Edge. Sound quality, while maybe not quite to BoomSound's bar on earlier HTC devices, is also surprisingly good. It may not be the ""best"" Android device I've used for media consumption, but its the most enjoyable. Signal quality is something of a mixed bag. In places where other phones have marginal LTE coverage, I noticed the Xperia would drop to 3G more often than not. In places with stronger LTE coverage, I was seeing results like this when comparing with the same SIM: OnePlus 3: 32mb down / 8mb up Galaxy S7 Edge: 33mb down / 8mb up iPhone 7 Plus: 35 down / 7mb up Xperia XZ: 27 down / 4mb up (Tests were run multiple times, and results are rounded and averaged.) The digitizer is nice and accurate, with almost perfect sensitivity. And throughout the device, there are numerous design cues that took me back to the Clie series of PDA's back in the long-long-ago. Even the no-needle-necessary SIM/SD tray is a welcome addition. You really do get a sense that this phone is ""expensive"" and attention was paid to every detail. Except one. This should all point to a higher rating, but the disappointing and deal-breaking discovery for me is that Sony chose to disable adoptable storage (at the time of this writing, there's not very extensive coverage of the phone, so this may be a more obvious deficiency in the future). I knew out of the gate that this only has 32GB, but with the inclusion of MicroSD support and every other ""nice"" feature of the phone seems to imply that it would just be there. It isn't, and enabling it over ADB doesn't work. So out of the box, with only software updates to the preinstalled apps and two weeks worth of my GMail account, 40% of the internal storage was already spoken for. While that might be acceptable for many, the second shoe dropped when it came to using the SD card as a media repository. Playback of Sony's own demo movies from the card (A Class 10 SanDisk Ultra) were choppy, and the transfer speed was dramatically slower than in my S7 Edge. My guess here is for whatever reason, Sony decided to go cheap here. And that, sadly, is why I'll be returning the phone. Were it not for that awful decision, it would be hands-down the best Android device I've used.",22,"Sony"
"1072","B01M1HY1E3",4,"false","I'm coming from a Z3 Compact, which I adored. I've owned the XZ for about 3 months now, here's how I feel about it. The Good: ++It's a gorgeous phone. Easily the best looking in it's class, if you ask me. The Mineral Black model has a subtle gradient going on that makes it shift from black to a sort dark chocolate depending on the angle you look at it from. Color aside, the general construction and shape of the phone is understated but elegant. The top and bottom are capped with brushed metal, while the front is covered in shock-resistant glass and the back uses a special brand of aluminum. ++Camera button. Something I've come to love about the Xperia line is their consistent inclusion of a camera button. Yes there are software shortcuts that are almost as fast, but you can't match the convenience of being able to go straight to the camera with the press of a button. It means, for example, that I don't need to take off my gloves to take a quick shot when I'm out in cold weather. And the more tactile experience is just nice, not to mention more comfortable for my hands. The button is also two-stage, which you can depress it lightly to tell the camera to focus (it's the same as holding the touchscreen shutter button) before pushing it in fully to take the shot. ++Fingerprint reader. Previous Xperias have had this, but again I'm coming from the Z3 so it's my first experience with it. I'm told the US version doesn't have the reader enabled, but you should see about re-enabling if you can. It's absurdly quick, such that if I'm not careful I can't even turn on the screen to check the time or notifications without unlocking the phone. It's not just convenient for unlocking the phone, there's some apps out there that can also make use of the fingerprint lock (mainly password lockers and such). ++The screen is bright and clear. I'm not of the opinion that 4k on my phone is a necessity, especially given now nice this 1080p screen looks. ++Fast and snappy. In day to day operations, the phone never misses a beat. Even slight stutters are uncommon. However, Sony made the curious decision to include only 3GB of RAM, whereas most 2016 flagships are doing 4GB or more. ++Sony's approach to Android is very light. It's essentially vanilla Android, with some apps of their own included. They've included a few more apps than I remember there being on the Z3, but many of them are legitimately useful. The Weather App, Sketch, and their multimedia browsers are all very good, and while I don't use them personally, Lifelog and News seem pretty robust too. ++The battery is very good for a phone of this size and power. It easily lasts me a day, typically longer if I'm not using it a lot. It's not up to par with the Z3 Compact, but the Z3 Compact was kind of a legendary phone in this respect. Stamina Mode and Ultra Stamina mode are back too, but as I'll explain later, the former isn't what it used to be. Ultra Stamina mode is still a great feature, though. ++The camera is great. It's fast, it takes good pictures, and it can record up to 4K video. The selfie cam is better than what you'll find on the XZ's peers. As a neat little touch, the phone will generate periodically generate highlight reels of your recent shots. ++Like many past iterations of Sony flagships, the XZ is IP68 certified, which means it's water and dust proof. You probably shouldn't take it scuba diving with you (though the camera button would surely come in handy there, as touchscreens don't do well with water), but it's nice knowing I can take my phone out in heavy rain and not worry about malfunctions. ++It has stereo speakers, and they sound pretty good. They're both on the front of the phone, which is the best placement in my opinion, as someone who's had phones in the past where the speakers were on the bottom or on the back. The XZ's speakers aren't very loud, though. Now, for the Bad: --This phone is advertised as being Dual SIM, and it is. However, the second SIM card slot is actually a combo slot; it functions as both a SIM card slot and a microSD slot. What this means is that you can't have two SIM cards and a microSD card installed. If you plan to use a microSD card, this is essentially a single SIM phone. --It's nice to see Sony move to USB-C with the XZ, however they only went halfway with it. This is USB-C in form, but only operates with USB2.0 specs and features. So, we get the drawbacks of USB-C (having to buy new cables, chargers and accessories for the new port) and none of the boons. In fact, Sony dropped MHL, so there's no way of doing video out over a cable. --Taking out the SIM card/microSD tray causes the phone to immediately reboot. This is isn't unheard of, but it's still a minor annoyance that I didn't have to deal with with my Z3 Compact. --Sony's camera software hasn't changed at all in since the Z3 days, maybe even earlier. It's serviceable, but it could do with some quality of life changes here and there. For example, 4K recording is not a mode in the video recorder like 1080p and 720p are, it's partitioned off into a separate camera app. --The FM Radio is gone. I won't pretend that I used it a lot on my Z3 Compact, but I liked having it all the same. Funny enough, the Xperia X has it. --Stamina mode's been gutted. It used to be that enabling Stamina gave you an extra few hours on the battery while only marginally reducing day to day performance. Now, while it still gives you a decent amount of extra battery life, it does so by really putting the squeeze on the CPU. What is usually a buttery smooth user experience becomes full of jerks and stutters, like you're using some $100 Chinese phone. All in all, it's not a slam dunk, but it's still a really nice phone.",NA,"Sony"

If you care about reception capability and the voice call quality of a phone, this is a better phone than S7. I will not bother why this is a great phone as this has been very well covered in the other reviews.The reason I gave it 4 stars is the quality (or the lack of it) of the speakerphone feature. If you need to use GPS and Google maps, you will find the sound volume at the highest level very weak. It is hardly audible and you will not able to hear and follow the voice instructions! And no I do not cover any of the speakers mistakenly. It is the plain phone with no cover. I wish it had the speakerphone volume comparable to S7.

"1090","B01M1HY1E3",5,"true","Sony, Sony is a very strange company sometimes and can really make you wonder what in the world they are doing, but one thing has seemed to always hold true throughout their insane decisions, quality. Everything Sony has ever made has absolutely flawless quality, all of their products are the epitome of perfection, and the Xperia XZ absolutely continues that tradition. I had an Xperia Z3 for two years before buying this phone, and I was stuck on outdated Android 5 because of T-Mobile pretending they never sold it, and I refused to switch to another brand, even with old, outdated Android, and it starting to show its age (although, still running fantastically well, and if I could get a newer OS on it, would probably still be using). Sony's Xperia line of phones are just so far ahead of everything Samsung, LG, or whatever else is out there it's unbelievable. My Z3, after *two years* still managed at least two days worth of battery life, no problem. And I have no doubts that the XZ will live up to the greatness that has been established. One thing that absolutely floored me as soon as I started using the XZ was its camera, now my Z3 had a pretty damn good camera too, and before that I had a Lumia 925 as my daily driver, but the XZ's camera is *scary* how great the pictures come out, from my testing I have a damn hard time believing that a phone took them. Obviously a DSLR can still do better, but for something you will always have on you? The camera on this phone is unbelievable, and the ""laser autofocus"" system is stupidly fast and very accurate, in under a second the focus is perfect and right where it needs to be, even in low light conditions. Some testing I did was in a room with just a 40w lightbulb on and it had focus almost instantly, every time. Performance is stellar too, it just flies through everything I even try throwing at it, even while downloading all of my apps onto it there was barely any stutter, and now that everything is installed and up to date, everything just glides. I also like how out of the box the default configuration pushes you towards full device encryption, and when you put in a microSD card it pops up a notification asking it you would like it encrypted as well, massive props to Sony for pushing for privacy there. The only real negative thing I can even think of saying about it would be that the fingerprint reader is disabled on the US version of the ROM, which, honestly doesn't really bother me that much, but would be a nice feature to have. Luckily, if I do want it, flashing the UK ROM enables it no problem. Overall, it is a stunningly gorgeous phone that completely exceeds all of my already high expectations from previous Sony phones, it's a damn shame that there are no carriers that still offer Sony phones in the US so that more people can see how great they are. Even paying full price upfront, it's still worth it. Stop looking at the garbage that LG and Samsung put out that die after a year (more of a jab towards LG there, everyone I know has had at least one LG phone die to bootloop woes, and Samsung isn't much better), and go with Sony, you won't regret it.",13,"Sony"
"1091","B01M1HY1E3",5,"true","I haven’t purchased a Sony Xperia since the original Z, and though I longed for that clicking-on-glass touch sound effect, there was always something that held me back about the models before now. The tech reviews are always harsh on Xperias, but let me tell you, Sony is at the top of their game with the XZ. No other phone feels quite like an Xperia and this one feels the absolute best, by far. The forest blue version has a chameleon effect, looking black one minute, blue the other and purple the next. And the matte metal finish on the back and the curved-edge loop design give it an unparalleled luxurious finish. Size is perfect and the whole thing is surprisingly lightweight. Camera takes fantastic photos, both in daylight and low light and the AR effects are a blast to play with. Performance has been buttery smooth, even after the 7.0 Nougat update. Not worried enough about the lack of fingerprint sensor to flash it with the European software and mess with my warranty. It’s perfect exactly the way it is. It feels just great to be back with the Xperia family.",9,"Sony"

"1099","B01M1HY1E3",5,"true","Color - Mineral Black I am transitioning from Oneplus 3 to Xperia XZ. I am satisfied with the performance my current phone but I am making this shift to XZ only for the design aspect and camera. I have been waiting so long for Sony to release an all rounder phone that can compete with other flagships in the market and this time they nailed it. Pros: Performance: Crisp and fast without any lag. Design: IMO, this is the best looking handset among the current flagships(including iphone 7 and pixel). It's been 3 days since I started using it, and it had already drawn attention from my friends. In one word it will put all the flagships to shame. Thumbs up for the mineral black color. Camera: Manual mode is a killer. Auto focus and video quality is also good. Indoor and low light shots are great if you can tweak little bit in the manual mode. Fingerprint sensor: If you can spend some time and flash the software with UK version, then you will probably unearth one of the amazing and effective finger print sensors in the market. It seems to respond faster than iphone6s, iphone 7 and oneplus 3. Display: Nothing to complain. Speakers: Dual speaker are really cool. SD Card: Not yet installed a micro sd card. So could not comment on that yet. Water proof: Have not tested and no intentions to do it. Cons: Battery: Its just satisfactory. I use my phone quite a bit during day(at least 2 hour talk time, 3 hours of listening music, 1 hour of bluetooth streaming in the car, 2 hours of browsing, social networking and video streaming combined). An extra 10% could have been better in my case. Wish list: Charging Time: Oneplus3 and Pixel has fast charge option that can charge 60% of the phone in 30 mins. I miss that feature in Xperia XZ. It usually takes 60 minutes for 60% charge. Overall: Sony has finally hit the cord by packing all the best and cool features into one single handset XZ. Be it camera, display, performance, fingerprint sensor or dual speakers it perfected each of those features. Price wise it is on the higher end of the spectrum competing with Samsung and Apple. Sony is a premium brand which uses finest materials. It is perceived as an upscale brand even before apple started working on it's ipods. At the same time I would not waste money if they deliver incompetent products(which is the case of some of their earlier xperias).But if a Sony product can compete with Samsung and Apple then I would not mind paying the premium. If you don't want to be one in millions using Iphones and Samsungs and yet do not compromise on quality and performance then the answer is ""Own an Xperia XZ"".",94,"Sony"

After this finding, I researched if I made a wrong choice, but every unboxing of this item shows the headphones included. My conclusion is that this is not a new phone, but good as new.

"1104","B01M1HY1E3",5,"true","I've had this phone for a number of weeks now and am very pleased overall. When I was looking to buy a new phone I was comparing this one specifically to Google's Pixel. Some of my initial concerns were getting updates timely, durability, and price. The hardware is standard for 2016 phones. The Pixel has a slightly newer processor that's negligibly faster. It was a disappointment the XZ only had 3GB of RAM though. This was still an upgrade from my previous phone however. There's also 1 very important fact to keep in mind when buying the latest and greatest in processing power - battery life. The Pixel had a beefier (ever so slightly) processor, and yet a smaller battery. Battery life will take a hit because of that. I was much less worried about it with this phone. The XZ (in the US) doesn't have a fingerprint sensor which is a bummer but I'm not going to miss it. The camera IS as high quality as Sony claims. I love it and can get off 10+ pictures without slow down. One of the reasons I was looking into the Pixel was because it would be nice to have a pure android phone. Samsung phones have that god-awful TouchWiz business and Sony's have the Xperia UI. You also have to wait for updates. I'm currently still waiting for Android 7.0 which I'm getting impatient for. The one thing I like about the Xperia is the customizability. Everyone Oo's and Awe's when they see my phone because the menus, buttons, etc all look extremely different from a normal android and they're surprised to find out I haven't rooted it. Some features this phone has that I couldn't get with Google's. Waterproofing - This was HUGE for me. I don't go around getting my phones wet however I have dropped one in the toilet before. That slip-up will destroy non-waterproof phones SD card slot - If the phone has 64GB of internal memory or more it's not an issue. Unfortunately to get that with the Pixel it massively hiked the price. Beyond what this phone cost. Front facing speakers - This was also a big deal for me. I listen to music quietly in the mornings when getting ready and can't wear headphones while doing it. I hate the way sound comes out muffled when the speakers are pointed somewhere else. In the end I decided I could live with the Xperia interface, one gig less of RAM and slow updates. I like the way this phone looks. It's unique. Sony goes the opposite direction of simply copying Apple like Google did with the Pixel. Anything hardware-wise the Pixel had over the XZ, this phone beat with additional features (like the waterproofing). I feel like for the money I'd rather buy those features than a sliver of improvement in hardware.",22,"Sony"

"1106","B01M1HY1E3",5,"true","Shipped same day for only $10 extra, package came by the evening, order was placed at noon. Phone is very quick and can take even better pictures than the Z3 did. Yes, the battery does drain quickly....quicker than the Z3, even in stamina mode, but that's due to the Nougat update. Yes, even the US version has the hardware for the fingerprint sensor, I was able to activate mine by loading a UK custom firmware (verified firmware). The only difference is that in the UK there is no LTE, so users will only see a 4G or 4g+ when on data, and the US software had software that you could see your voicemail (no big loss to me). Other than that the phone works amazingly. EDIT: I have to thank Amazon, in an unfortunate case, my phone was damaged recently.

"1110","B01M1HY1E3",3,"true","This is a great phone, but with one key flaw - Sony has elected to not repair these in North America unless you are under warranty. So if you live in the US, and your phone is damaged in a way that voids the warranty (like being dropped, for example), then your phone is a useless paperweight. I have called Sony support a couple of times to get a repair, and as of June 2017, they are only accepting warranty repair orders (before June, even that wasn't possible). I asked how long it would be until they take non-warranty orders, and they said they didn't know, but had been told it would be months. They offered no alternatives. When my daughter dropped my phone, there was no external damage, but they charging cable doesn't fit properly anymore (it just slides in and out without holding - I used a rubber band to hold it in for a while, but that eventually stopped working). Since this is a relatively rare phone, there are very few (if any) third-party places that can repair it properly, and I read a bunch of online reports from people who said it came back worse than they sent it from third-party places. So now I have a very expensive and shiny paperweight, and am wishing that I had just bought a Samsung, or iPhone, or anything common enough that I could get it fixed here in the US. It is a real shame since this is my third Sony Xperia phone, and I am a true and faithful fan. Heartbreaking that there is no way to get it fixed now. Things happen to phones - if you get this one, you will always be one freak drop damage accident away from completely losing your investment, and these are not cheap.",5,"Sony"

Sony does not care about you as a customer. My phone ended up bricking about 5 months after I bought it. The phone did not turn on, no lights even when charging. You would think it was an open and shut case and I will get a warranty. Nope, once I shipped it (under my dime) to their facility it seems like they just opened my box, made up some bull about physical damage (No signs of being dropped or abuse whatsoever mind you) and just shipped it back. I was not notified or anything. I found out when I received the phone. To make matters worse I called prior to receiving my device back for a status update and they told me the phone was being inspected by quality control to check the repair was done right.

I look around at the newest, flashiest cell phones and think about that as some form of madness. I'm 40 years old and just bought a cell phone for the first time. Seems like all things are going mobile and soon you won't be able to do anything without a cell number. I chose this one for a number of reasons. Yes, the aesthetics are one of those reasons. I don't know what it is about Sony. They have their own designs for whatever they make. It's not for everyone, but if it catches your eye you will know what I mean. When a lot of designs seem curvy, Sony looks like a pointy edged box design. So simple yet it speaks to me. I love it, and have bought their devices all the way back to the mini disc player. I bought the international version with the finger print reader enabled. The trade off is that it isn't compatible with 4g. I don't know what any of that means. The finger print lock is nice. I like it. But it's a phone. And the first one I've ever owned. I don't know why I should care about 4 or 5 g or whatever. It's fast enough for me. Look, I spent time trawling through all these expert reviews criticising every tiny detail about a phone, 4gb ram isn't enough, the screen is poor, the camera doesn't do well enough. I don't know who these people are or what they need all the fancy stuff for. I don't care! The screen on this is nice and clear. It seems fast enough to do whatever I need it to do. The camera takes nice pictures. I didn't need to pay way too much money for all kinds of elaborate nonsense on a phone. This one has all kinds of stuff it can do and apps to play with.

"1143","B01M1HY1E3",4,"false","UPDATE: 9Jan 2017: Enjoying the phone especially for the media handling as mentioned in the review, but have lowered my rating now due to ""insufficient memory"" notices. To be fair I downloaded a library of music from Spotify and have a healthy amount of apps. But as a flagship phone, the internal memory is just not competitive with other flagships. That being noted, I've started using my Sennheiser 650 headphones with Cardas cables, and the sound is nothing short of amazing. Apple, Samsung, HTC, LG and now Google have been the names, perhaps, most shoppers of a new flagship phone consider. But Sony has had their own cutting edge innovations, like the first waterproof body, dating back to 2012. Does this new XZ offer enough to make you consider it over it’s excellent competition? I’ve owned it for a month now and so can give my impressions. The phone itself has a slate, squared profile that makes it unique from other designs. The entire front is gorilla glass with slightly rounded edges at the sides with the display extending almost to the edges of both sides giving it a modern, minimalistic look. The back is made out of a unique Alkeleido metal, which is a premium, super smooth aluminum with solid feel. The display is 5.2” which places it midway between the 2 new Google Pixel phones and the 2 iPhone 7 models. I’ve been using a 5.7” Samsung Note 4 and was afraid this smaller size would feel lacking. Surprisingly, I find it much easier to hold and operate and I like the compromise between super large and compact. The display is full 1080p offering 424 pixel density. Color management makes photos very vivid and white backgrounds are much whiter and true than previous phones I’ve owned. The display, for lack of a better comparison, has that wet vivid shine like your car after it's had carnauba wax applied with a power buffing. Videos look fantastic. This body is, again waterproof, rated IP68, meaning it can be submerged in 3 feet of water. So if it slips into the sink or drops into the toilet or pool, you won’t see your investment instantly DOA. I’ve never done that, but it only takes one time I suppose. The processor is the Snapdragon 820 so the operation is fast and fluid. The camera is 23 Megapixels rear and 13 megapixels front selfie. When I show my photos to friends they all comment on the vividness of the rendering. Ram is less than some competitors at 3GB vs other’s 4GB which concerned me, until I realized that my Google Pixel C tablet also has “only” 3GB of RAM and the operation has been superb. But here are the two items that were huge for me. I was never excited about listening to music on any other phone I’ve had so was expecting the same vanilla experience with the XZ. I plugged in some Denon earbuds and opened Spotify albums downloaded at the Extreme Quality setting and the sound was amazing. I plugged in some high end Shure earbuds and was completely blown away. Not surprising, I suppose, considering Sony’s expertise in high quality audio, like their 1200 dollar digital Walkman. If you appreciate higher quality sound, give this XZ a listen. The second thing that will give this phone an edge in some people’s mind is memory. It comes with 32gb, but offers the option of adding up to 200gb of additional memory via SD card. Apple’s iPhone 7 with that much total memory would add three hundred dollars to its price. Google's max is 128GB. So if you need lots of storage that’s something to consider. One small detail is that the XZ uses the new USB-C interface and for charging. The USB-C is great because the shape is a consistent oval so it fits in the phone opening no matter which way you hold the plug. So no more aggravating flipping back and forth trying to insert the plug with possible damage to the plug and the jack. A small detail but it is a nice change. Are there any negatives I don’t like? I loved having the ability to swap out batteries in my old Samsung Note 4, which I can’t do with this XZ. In fairness, that’s one cost of having the waterproof construction, and other flagships don’t allow this either. In total, I really love this new phone, especially it’s incredible handling of digital music files, it’s clean, modern slate design, the monster storage capacity at a reasonable cost, as well as the vivid almost 3d color display and bright white background rendering, the easy insertion USB-C port, all in a 5.2” screen size that’s large but easy to hold and operate with one hand. All that being said, the price is still high compared with similarly priced flagship phones including iPhone 7 and the new Google Pixel phone, both of which are considered a higher state of the art offerings with options of larger screen size and higher resolution. I have not heard their fidelity as far as media, especially audio files. But if premium Audio is high on your priority list, I believe this Sony XZ is still a phone you should at least sample at a retailer near you before making your phone purchase, not withstanding it's lofty price point.",NA,"Sony"

Sony has always been ahead of the game for me but since is not popular over here in the states I guess not many buy it.

The phone is fantastic, works flawlessly after a month of use, and only about once or twice has the battery life been a problem after consistent use. It is difficult to find a case that looks good and protects fully, but that's what we get for wanting a relatively obscure device. My only gripe about the phone itself is that finger print scanner can be a tiny bit hit or miss, but I found adding the same finger multiple times allow for fluid use of this feature. Lastly, I would say I'm extremely disappointed in the glass screen protector options for this phone due to the slightly curved edges of the screen, but I place blame on the third party screen protector manufacturing than on the Sony.

"1191","B01M1HY1E3",2,"false","If you treat your customers like garbage, it doesn't matter how sleek your products are. I should have heeded the warnings of others who had to deal with Sony's ""repair"" process. (Has anyone successfully done so?) A month after buying my phone, the headphone jack stopped working correctly. ""Fine,"" I thought. ""It's under warranty."" Since I need my phone, I waited a little while to send it in, but still well within the warranty period. I call Sony, and I send them my phone (at my expense) for repairs. A couple of weeks later, it's returned to me unrepaired. So, having gone without my expensive phone for three weeks, I call Sony. When I ask for an explanation, they say the warranty was voided. So, to recap: My expensive new phone stops working correctly a month after I buy it. I pay to send it in to Sony, so that they can fix it. They then send me back the phone in a box, not even bothering to explain why they didn't fix the headphone jack, which probably would have cost them next to nothing to do. My phone was kept in an aluminum protective case and returned to Sony in pristine condition. There isn't so much as a scratch on it, and it has never been submerged in water (even though the phone is supposedly waterproof, but it's Sony, so they could be lying). This is outrageous. Pissed, I ""escalated"" the issue, had the opportunity to wait and see if I'd have the *privilege* of sending my phone back to Sony again and waiting another few weeks for them to decide if they want to repair it. How did that work out? I received an e-mail with some photos supposedly showing my phone was beyond repair. They showed a photo of a hairline fracture on the SIM/SD card slot. I check my phone, and I don't see anything wrong, and I certainly don't see the discoloration shown in the photo. Keep in mind that there were no functional problems with the SIM/SD card slot. Even more pissed, I reply to the e-mail from support, explaining that my phone doesn't, and never has, had this kind of discoloration, that it was housing both a SIM and SD card at that very moment with no apparent problems, and that, more importantly, it has nothing to do with the *headphone jack* for which I sent it in for repair. They eventually replied, asking for a screenshot for my IMEI. I provided it, and they agreed to take my phone back again. All of this is completely unnecessary. Every time they do this, I must wipe and reset my phone, and use an older backup phone until they return it. It is extremely inconvenient. Do a web search for ""xperia won't honor warranty."" There's a pattern. UPDATE: After multiple calls, broken assurances to get back to me, and eventually sending my phone back two times for repair, Sony finally fixed my phone. So I'm raising the review from one star to two. The phone itself is fine, but after what I went through, I'm still pissed.",3,"Sony"
"1192","B01M1HY1E3",5,"false","This review turned out a lot longer than originally thought but this is a big purchase and the professional reviews I have seen are pretty mixed so I did not want to miss anything and wanted to share my experience with you. I know I would appreciate what I have to say below. Amazon was sold out of Forest Blue when I purchased this item so I bought it from another store but wanted to share my experience wit the large amazon consumer base :) I bought this phone to replace my 4.5 year-old lg optimus that had grown outdated but still was in great working condition. As I have an iPhone for work and do not care for it much, I researched phones heavily this past year and narrowed it down to making the tough choice between the Xperia XZ and the Galaxy s7 Edge. Since I was finally getting a new phone I did not just want to get the one everyone said was the 'best', I wanted to put my money towards the phone that would provide me with a unique experience with top of the line specs and I am very happy I went with the Xperia XZ. First off the phone is beautiful. Many online reviews said this phone was not particularly attractive to non-Sony Phone buyers and after having the phone for a few weeks I respectfully disagree. Maybe it is just the Forest Blue color, but I have repeatedly been asked what kind of phone I had while at work or in-line in stores by people who think the phone is ""really cool"" or in another case ""super cute"". It is a design/color that seems to appeal to a lot of people. I thought I would have a problem with the increase in screen size from my old phone, but I am a tall guy with big hands and have no problem reaching the entire screen with my thumb while holding it in one hand. My girlfriend uses two hands but she does so with her iPhone as well so I would not hold that against the Xperia but just thought I would note it because the one hand use was important to me. As for the phone itself I have no complaints. Again I note the age of my old phone, so any phone would probably be a nice change in speed and such, but it was very easy to transfer my old data to the XZ and it is incredibly quick and responsive when using apps. The display is stunning with excellent color contrast. The camera takes excellent pictures, haven't tried too many selfies but scenes look great and capture motion very well. I am a big fan of the camera shutter button and notification light, quick charge is nice. The battery goes a day of occasionally gaming and internet browsing once you fine-tune the settings. I was initially upset about the lack of the fingerprint scanner but I saw the hardware for it is on the US version and you can enable with a little software work around, but it will void the warranty so I have not gotten around to trying that yet. But honestly with the smart-lock and security settings, the phone is unlocked whenever it is near me so it is really not a big deal at all. The Lifelog and Xperia Lounge apps are cool and provide great exercise feedback and free perks respectively. I am also happy to report the water proofing does work to at least some degree as the first thing I did when I received the phone was run it under the sink for a while and it worked no problem. I am a big Sony fan so I was very interested to see how it faired remote playing my ps4. Once I paired my controller with my phone it was smooth sailing and playing Dark Souls was far easier than I expected it would be. I did not try playing online multiplayer through remote play yet but even with my Vita that can be very leggy so I expect it would be similar with the XZ. In conclusion, I love my other Sony products and am happy to have the Xperia XZ join that list of awesome products. I disagree with the professional reviews about the phones appearance design wise as well as their BIG issue with lack of fingerprint reader. It's design seems to draw lots of appeal in my experience and is a welcome change to the similarly designed Galaxy, iPhone, and Pixel. The phone is definitely not cheap, but if you are looking to upgrade your old phone and want to put your money towards a phone that is at the very least equivalent to if not better than the other flagship phones out there in addition to catching peoples attention and providing a more unique experience, than the Xperia XZ is the perfect choice. As I said my old phone was outdated and I am a big Sony fan so I may be bias, but comparing this to my friends new galaxy and my girlfriends iPhone 6s, I know I made the right choice going with the Xperia XZ. As an added note, I will say finding special cases will be hard for the XZ as it is not a very common phone, but if you get the Forest Blue I would recommend a clear color because the phone looks great as is",2,"Sony"
"1193","B01M1HY1E3",4,"false","I confess. This is my first grown-up smartphone that isn't some limited, older model from a pay-as-you-go service. Not that I haven't been a grown up. I just did not have much use for even a basic cell phone, as I am usually at home and in reach of the landline. I was, however, missing having the digital organization capabilities (desperately needed and avoided for too long by this creative, but ADD/ADHD brain) and a camera on me at all times that I can stow in my tiny purse. The Sony Xperia XZ definitely fulfills those desires. It is a larger phone, but it still is thin and lithe enough to fit in my smaller, arthritic (stiff and not as grippy as they once were) hands. I'm sure adding a rubbery case to it will improve my grip on things, and I plan to do so eventually. The design is such that the phone really disappears when you are using the screen (previous ipods, iphones I have setup for my parents, and other smartphones I have played with tend to get grubby and the designs make me feel like I am holding a phone and watching something on a phone(or similar digital device)... The Xperia XZ makes me feel like I am just one on one with the image. It's a lovely feeling and really sucks one into the viewing experience. Images (still and motion) are beautiful. The screen brightness is, of course, adjustable. It can go bright enough that I can use it in bright sunlight and see everything crisply (even without my reading glasses). The processing speed is marvelous, and makes the old ipad mini I was using for similar tasks feel pathetic. There is just no waiting (unless you fill up the memory. Get a card. Learn how to transfer bulkier files to the memory card.). I am using this with Ting. In our area it operates on T-Mobile's network (at Ting prices). So far, so good. I have been using this since mid-October without a case or screen protector. I realize I'm asking for trouble, but I wanted to sample the durability and Sony was delayed in getting their official cases to market (I still can only find them from sites based in the UK, as of beginning of December 2016, though plenty of 3rd party solutions are available via Amazon's Prime program. I have not vetted those cases yet.). So far, with almost 2 months of being thrown in my backpack (dropped, though not violently... it slipped off my desk chair to tile over concrete), and constant use it still looks pristine. Not a ding or scratch. The screen really does resist smudging and is easily cleaned with a quick rub on a t-shirt. Everything still looks brand new. As far as photography goes, it takes lovely pictures. It does have manual adjustment but I am having great difficulty adapting to non-tactile controls and I'm not fast enough yet, on this particular interface, to capture the fleeting moments I wanted to capture when I was contemplating adding a phone to my daily bag in manual mode. Automatic mode does a fine job, especially for images for posting on social media and even projected on my TV (a 4k LG). Pixel-peeping types might scoff at things like highlights and shadows, but when I am shooting in JPEG and automatic modes on any camera, I am more interested in capturing a moment clearly than worrying about those bits- for those I use my A7, a good legacy lens, and everything manual and RAW. I don't have this phone to replace that camera. I have it to fill in the gaps where my camera is left home or in photo-emergencies (the perfect sunset on the way home... for example). The on board camera does just fine. I like that it does have tactile buttons for adjusting one setting (the volume button, so anything up or down can be set to use those) and a button to snap the image. In that way it feels like a more traditional camera, which helps this old-school being use it more effectively and consistently. As far as video goes, it takes lovely video, but for me it is only working on HD mode. Maybe it's just my particular, individual phone, but I have found that at HD it works fine and takes lovely, fluid video without a problem. At FULL HD (either 30 or 60), it is choppy and appears to be lagging and buffering. Everything breaks up. On 4K, it takes segments of a few seconds, the overheats or the 4K app crashes. I feel like Sony jumped the gun on boasting 4K on this....Even if you need a super fast memory card, or nearly empty internal storage, to make it function properly the overheating is annoying, the frequent warnings before it overheats are annoying...It makes me hesitate even attempting to use anything other than plain HD as I want reliable, continuous shooting when something interests me enough to switch from still to motion, otherwise moments are missed trying to get the darn thing to work and then you can't even watch it or share it. That's all I have for now... I will update this as I continue to use it. Right now, I'm thrilled just to be finally up to speed and able to use all of these nifty apps to organize my world and communicate with others without being tied to my wifi and I get to capture and share bits of my day with others, without lugging the digital/mechanical love of my life (my Sony A7 with Minolta legacy glass) everywhere. So yes, I'm happy I got the Sony Xperia XZ and if anything changes, I will post updates right here.",1,"Sony"

I've had very bad karma and dropped and cracked a few of them, so I am constantly replacing them with the latest version. I was happy with Z5 and Z5 Premium, but I really really wanted a USB C type phone as micro USB really pisses me off. Cables always go bad at some point. I honestly love the form factor of the Xperia xz and really wanted to keep it forever. I have however, been humiliated several times in front of my iPhone touting friends, when the xz decides to grind down to a halt for no particular reason. It's painful and a reboot doesn't always help. I have performed three hard resets, been very careful with app selections, etc. I tried developer options, disabling the cleaning app features and battery saver, pretty much everything except the pc repair feature. I know that Sony phones have a history of overheating, it's everywhere. I love Sony products and I know that they eventually break, but I am stubborn. It's time to splurge into the xz premium, which promises to be the end all. Everyone online swears by it. I will recommend to you, to skip this phone and go for the xz premium, or simply, if you can't afford it, go back to the Z5. The Z5 is a good smartphone, nothing wrong with it, except the micro USB port of course. But you can just buy a dozen cables and dispose of them as they stop working. I will probably keep the xz as a backup to the premium. Maybe future firmware versions will fix the overheat, slow down problem.",1,"Sony"
"1195","B01M1HY1E3",4,"false","This is a fairly large phone with a good camera. The camera is important to me because my old smartphone had one that did not have very good color balance, especially indoors. The Xperia's camera is 100% better in picture quality. However, I have a couple of concerns about it. For one thing, the lens is positioned near the edge of the camera so it is very easy to partially block the lens with your finger. I ruined several shots that way. Also, the gizmo that switches from regular lens to selfie lens is easily hit by accident. I thought I was taking some stunning sunset pictures but all I got was ugly selfies! The phone was fairly easy to set up. I purchased a SIM card for my carrier at the big store with the giant red balls out front. (Do check that your carrier uses a GSM/LTE network.) My carrier was a bit hard to work with this time because their ""system was down."" (Isn't it odd that communications companies are often bad at communications?) Once their system was back up, they were backlogged so I had to hold longer than usual. However, this was not the phone's fault, it was Consumer Cellular's problem. Finally they activated the phone and I was able to use it. It's best to allow yourself some time for unexpected delays when setting up ANY phone. Once activation was done, the Sony Xperia was easy to start using. It does not work exactly like my old Huawei phone but mostly it is intuitive. Still, I have not figured out why my pictures don't upload to FB. Hopefully you will be more adept with technology than I am. I did get it set up to communicate with my laptop via Bluetooth and that works well. This phone is a bit large for my feminine hands; that is, I have to stretch my fingers to hold it properly, and I wish it were a little lighter. But the voice quality sounds good, better than my old phone. Also the battery holds a charge longer than some phones I've had in the past. So technology marches forward and Sony is keeping pace.",1,"Sony"

Although it's not the best, the camera good enough for social media snaps. The stereo speakers are cool, but it's pretty weak. The LED flash is weak. There's hardly any bloat compared to other brands or carrier phones, so it's very smooth with great battery life. Due to its sleek design with Snapdragon 820, it can overheat (with warning) from heavy usage especially when hot spot is enabled. I'm not a heavy user anyway.

This one is the last nail in the coffin. 6 months in and my phone, mid Spotify jam, died. It stopped working and wouldn't turn on. Dealing with Sony's customer service was a headache since they're hard to get a hold of (no weekends and after 5pm business days) and you'll be speaking to a foreign representative. My turn around time was 1.5 months. Yup that's right. My representative put the wrong address. Standard turn around is 1 month. Luckily I had a back up phone meanwhile. After I received my phone, all was well until my screen became unresponsive because my phone was picking up a phantom signal indicating that it had a phone cover on it. That lasted a few days. And as I type this my phones scroll down menu keeps sliding up and down.. Maybe it was the luck (bad) of the drawl but I won't be revisiting any sony models any time soon. Bianca Bianca",3,"Sony"

"1219","B01M1HY1E3",5,"true","I have been an Android user for years now, and I've been around the block with the OS, and hardware manufacturers after being exhausted with Apple's lack of progress with their phones and iOS itself. I've used HTC, LG, SAMSUNG, etc. you name the brand, I've probably used it at some point or another. Of all these manufacturers, Sony Mobile Communication's line of XPERIA smartphones have been my personal favorite, and the XPERIA XZ is currently my favorite of them all. Yes, the design is drastically different the the previous XPERIA Z5 and XPERIA X series of phones, but it's so much more appealing to the eye, and comfortable to hold. So let's get to the strengths of this phone: - Excellent build quality; the phone is all metal, except for the screen, and it definitely feels like a premium handset. - Unique design; Sony seems to have a fairly unique design that while it's not flashy, it certainly looks elegant and appealing to the eyes. - Expandable memory up to 256GB; which many other hardware manufacturers seem to lack - A 3.5MM Headphone Jack, which seems to be vanishing from their competitors. Other Pros: - The pre-installed software ins't intrusive, and in some cases useful; the SONY Walkman-Music App is simple, clean and has plenty of features that have pushed me to transfer my music files from Google's App, to the Walkman-Music App. - PlayStation Network (including PlayStation App, Remote Play, and PlayStation Music) If you're a PlayStation Gamer like me, and you're invested in PS3, PS Vita and/ or PS4, the PlayStation App allows you to message your friends, download games, check system settings, control your PS4 via Second Screen, or Remotely, etc. the Remote Play App allows XPERIA users to stream their PlayStation 4 Games to their phone with a DualShock 4 Controller, which is great when I have friends over and they want to watch YouTube in my living room where my PS4 is. - The rear-facing camera takes some gorgeous pictures, and when set to manual, they look even better! - Aside from Sony's pre-installed apps, Sony doesn't drastically change or manipulate Android to the point where it's unrecognizable like other brands do. Some Cons: - Price; Sony's phones are priced more than others, which can turn potential buyers away - Availability; Why Sony Mobile Communications doesn't partner with Sprint or T-Mobile and create some worthwhile marketing campaigns for these phones is beyond me - Software Updates; because Sony Mobile Communications manufacturers so many different XPERIA smartphones and tablets, Android updates can take longer, but this can be excusable for most, but it's worth mentioning anyway. To Summarize: Sony Mobile Communications is, in my opinion, THE place to go to for Android-based smartphones, the cameras are great, there's features like expandable memory and headphone jacks that seem to be disappearing from their competition, and the design is unique enough to where I have curious passer-byes asking in admiration what kind of phone I have.",20,"Sony"
"1220","B01M1HY1E3",2,"true","Phone is decent, but the charging port broke 3 weeks in. Phone has a 1 year warranty and Sony fixed the (took 2 weeks). Upon receiving it I noticed that the screen had been damaged during the repair. I contacted them out and they said they'd have to call back. They never did can back, even after checking in a few times. About a month after the repair the earpiece speaker stopped working reliably during calls, the proximity sensor stopped working (so screen stays off during calls and got can't hang up), and later the screen started falling off. So don't expect Sony to do good repairs or to stand by their repairs. After all that I bought a different brand of phone.",3,"Sony"

I like the omni design and the screen size. It's just perfect for one hand operation. The most disappointing for me was the image processing. The camera sensor is top notch and the focus system they implemented was on point and fast. In low light it really does suffer even with enough light or in day light the images looks bad when you start zooming in photos. I did update my Xperia xz to nougat but the image processing is just bad. I have the LG g4 and it's almost comparable to Xperia xz well except the cpu and it does a better job. Hopefully Sony will do a better job with their image processing. Looking forward for their upcoming xperia though, but for now I end up having a ZTE axon 7 more bang for my buck.",NA,"Sony"
"1238","B01M1HY1E3",3,"false","Just listing the negatives in this review. Phone feels nice and and fast enough. I kept it because I got it for about $400 which was reasonable for a brand new unlocked phone and it's slim and strong so it doesn't feel bulky in my pocket. Sound quality for music is great but I've heard complaints that my mic sounds muffled. Le Bad: 1. Screen is small-ish relative to the size of the phone. What makes it worse is that part of the screen (about 1 cm) is devoted to the navigation buttons. This leads to #2 2. The empty space next to the lower speaker (by the mic) could have been used for the button area, like my Samsung J7. 3. Charges pretty fast - but battery drain is unbelievable. I have to turn off excessive sync and background data for all the programs except the most essential like email and Google. Also I set screen brightness to bare minimum. 4. It updates to Android 7 but LOTS of OS updates on the first boot and you'll be waiting for about 40 minutes watching the Android with the spinning cube in its belly during that time. 5. Minus 1 star for the non-removable battery. Period. 6. The built in previous phone transfer tool would constantly time-out when connecting to my J7. Basically ended up copying to the SD card with my old phone and using dropbox for other items. 7. Low-light focus is about the same as less expensive phones. 8.

"1243","B01M1HY1E3",5,"false","Well, I'm finally able to write my review. I've been through a lot with my Sony Xperia XZ during the past few weeks. It is my first ever phone of this caliber -- my previous phone is a Nokia. My first challenge when I got my phone was the lack of a sim card. Since I didn't realize that being unlocked meant that it came without a sim card, I got in touch with the nice people at Amazon who set me straight. Then came choosing a service provider. After some research I decided on a plan and went to the storefront where I signed up, got my sim card, and got set up with my phone number and my new Google email account, which you need to have with this phone. The people at the said that Sony makes and excellent phone although they seem to be somewhat overlooked. It has been a steep learning curve for me, but I've come a long way -- added contacts, messaged and made calls, added apps, taken pictures and have used the Ok! Google feature. I love this phone.

They also have software on their website that lets you repair your phone if it ever comes to that. I thought that was incredible. The music player, I love that too and the speakers play music loud and clear and I still have room to turn up the volume more if I wish. The phone has a lot of memory compared to Pre-Paid phones like Go-Phones and takes great pictures but is it really worth $600, when you can buy a Samsung Pre-Paid for much less. The camera is obviously awesome and I like that you can zoom in or out, just by pinching the screen. The phone is easy to hold although slippery without a case. I dropped it twice before my case came. If you really want a phone that can take great pictures and play loud music, and you need some decent memory, this is the phone for you.

After stalling me and ignoring my calls for a month, the tech report comes back that this isn't covered by Warranty as charging the phone was considered Customer abuse. They claimed that since the phone still technically powers up, there is no manufacturer fault as the reason I can no longer charge it is because the USB plate slid out and therefore not their problem. I used it with a Sony Charger too. I argued with them back and forth on the matter but they really don't care at all. I would certainly have thought that whether the fault was on the Charger or phone they would have replaced the dang phone. I have Sony branded everything. Tablets, TV, consoles.

"1251","B01M1HY1E3",5,"true","This review is for the Sony Xperia XZ. To start, I'm running T-Mobile here in the northeast. Also, we have other Xperia phones (Z Ultra, Z3 and Z5), and this is replacing a Samsung Galaxy S7, as my patience with Samsung and Apple is exhausted. (My wife has always had Samsungs and even she was getting ticked off) First, I'm 100% convinced that so called ""Experts"" who review phones are being paid by the phone manufacturers, and I'll explain. Take screen resolution. They complain that a particular phone is weak based on specs. Never mind that your eye can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p with screen sizes less than 46"", any 5"" phone that doesn't have 1080p is committing the ultimate sin in the view, as long as it's not Apple. For me, the order of importance in a phone is the following (starting with the most important): A) It should be able to get a good signal from a cell tower. B) The WiFi should work well and be stable C) The camera should take nice quality pictures. D) It should be snappy and respond quickly E) The build quality of the device and display. My wife has the S7. Wherever we traveled, she'd hit weak spots and lose connectivity, while those of us with the Sony phones never have issues (she has had issues in the heart of Manhattan, while I'm getting 5 bars with my old Ultra). At home, I have 3 access points, and the channels are spread out. All the Sony phones have no issues switching from one AP to another, while the Samsung would lose it's mind. The Cameras are equivalent (edge to Sony), the Samsung has a nicer display, but the build and feel of the XZ is just at another level. As the older Xperias Z's are superior to any of the Samsungs, the new XZ is magnitudes better (there is just no comparison). and that's why I brought up the issue of ""professional"" reviews. This phone makes the previous Xperias look cheap and they are great phones in and of themselves. How Sony is not dominating the market is beyond me. I don't know much about the LG and HTC phones, but having owned an iPhone and various Samsung Galaxy phones, they can't hold a candle compared to this new XZ",205,"Sony"

Case: Great idea to put the SIM card and Memory Port in one place you don't need to open everyday. Also, it's great that the charging port has it's own place at the bottom. Material/Design: Coming from someone who used to own a Sony Xperia Z2 (made of metal and glass), they messed up with the materials used in this one. It's made of a kind of hard plastic with a matte color finish. It looks cheap, far from the real value of this smartphone. Anyway, I'm gonna use a case to protect it so I don't care so much about it. Fingerprint: Does not come with the finger print scanner (I can live without it). Software: Recently updated with Android 7.0 Nougat. I love it! It's like they finally listen to us, very easy to navigate, very organized. Also I used Xperia Transfer Mobile, it was very easy to transfer everything from my last Xperia. Color/Brightness: Great, clear view, realistic! Just amazing. Camera: TOP! The best camera in the market. Sound: This feature is very important for me. At first, I was dissatisfied, the sound was super low and I was going crazy. I was used to the high performance of the Xperia Z2 with great sound. I don't know what happend but It fixed itself, don't know if it was the film I took off the smartphone or the software update, but It sounds great, just as my last Xperia.

Sony lightly skins the UI, so the phone is really fast and yet customizable. They also have very nice touches everywhere. Like for example they have what's called stamina mode, which kicks in and manages battery life when the battery drops below a certain percent charge. I have had an HTC flagship, Motorola (Moto X 2014), and one other Sony flagship phone. Of all of them the Sony manages battery life really well. In fact my older Sony phone the Still being used as a miniature tablet even while the battery of my Motorola has become completely useless. Another thing that Sony does well is their cell phone cameras. A little known fact is that most sensors in every cell phone is actually a Sony sensor -- all with the exception of HTC who uses ultra pixels. However, Sony keeps proprietary image processing algorithms to themselves. The colors of an HTC camera is a little bit more natural looking, while Sony tends to slightly saturate the colors. With this newer phone I was able to customize and dial down that behavior. I wish Sony included a fingerprint sensor on this phone. I was looking forward to playing around with that, but I must wait for my next smartphone. The display is nice. The screen of my previous Sony phone was a little bit soft and plasticky. Just by sliding in and out of my front pockets I scratched the screen. This newer screen feels harder and in tougher environments hasn't scratched after a month of being tossed around. The antenna design was thoughtful. The Motorola had weak reception in a few places. Surprisingly this one handled them better.",3,"Sony"

"1261","B01M1HY1E3",2,"false","I purchased this phone and regret it. This Sony product has many glitches. Sony has the attitude that it is the consumer who should buy their product and then work to fix their bad product. Some of the many issues. 1. The screen on the phone goes blank when making a phone call. There appears to be no way to restore the screen- and that leaves one unable to access the dial pad, or adjust the volume, etc. This one problem has resulted in many dropped calls. The attempt to reset the phone does not fix this issue. Very, very frustrating. 2. The phone comes loaded with bloatware that only serves to aggravate the user. Facebook is but one of many examples. Facebook is a horrible company that routinely violates the privacy of its users- and I want nothing to do with this. Yet one has to go through the phone to disable multiple apps that one does not want- and these can not be deleted from the phone. 3. The advertised 4K video is misleading. When one wants to shoot 4K video, a third party application has to be found and turned on- this function should be a inherent part of the camera... One more aggravation. 4. Using 4K video causes the phone to heat up, and it causes the phone to shut down. Very, very poor design. 5. The basic features of the phone are not user friendly. It takes hard work to get the setting all set so the phone can even be used for basic functions- like MMS messages. 6. The pictures the phone takes are of poor quality when shooting indoors. Bottom line- avoid this phone. This is a Sony boondoggle.",1,"Sony"

I couldn't seem to find a good comparison between the 2, maybe there wasn't any interest, but I bought both to compare. The short answer is the XZ feels and performs like a modern flagship phone aught to. The X Performance performs like a modern flagship, but the ""feel"" is not there. This is superficial at best. But to me, makes the phone worth it's slightly higher price. If you're looking for bargain, unique and high quality phone though, the X Performance aught to be on your list. Sony's ecosystem is great, and hopefully the 2017 XZ Premium and XZs make them a serious contender in the US market.",4,"Sony"

"1279","B01M1HY1E3",5,"true","Beautiful design. Feels expensive and good in the hand, not too big not too small but of course is is relative as we all have difference size hands. Amazing screen! The colors are rich and vibrant when using it, viewing pics, or watching videos. Powerful! It flew threw setup and installing my last Android backup in record time. Also it updated to Nougat while I was setting it up for the first time, so the latest Android OS right from the start was a great bonus! Yes the international version is 64GB of internal memory vs the US's 32, but with up to 256 MicroSD expandable memory, that's not really an issue. Plus not all US carriers provide full bandwidth support for the international version (i.e. you might not get LTE, only 4G) so do your research before buying based on specs alone. Price is right compared to other phones on the market, i.e. the new Google Pixel. I had already pre-ordered my XZ but watched the Pixel announcement and really liked what they are finally doing, but also had some concerns: 1) it's first gen tech. Google is an amazing company but i've been burned before and make it a point to never buy 'the first' of any new tech that's released. 2) it's expensive! if you get the big 128GB model and the insurance it's going to sent you back just under $900 bucks. That's asking a lot for a smartphone, even one that's 100% Google made. So when i looked at the two, i stuck with my XZ and couldn't be happier. And battery life has been really good. Using it all day (8AM to 9PM) without charging and still have 30-40% juice left. Mine came with Sony's rapid charging wall-plug, and I bought some Anker 3.0 USB-C cables (bought through Amazon of course ^_^), so she charges very quickly. I think in under 10 minutes I went from under 50% battery life to 100%. I'm not a tech professional by any means, I'm just your average consumer that's tech savvy and values my dollars going to quality products that I'll get at least 2-3 years solid use out. Yes, there are other Android phones on the market with bigger/better technical specs, but not everything needs to be 100% top-end. If you do that you get crap battery life because that bigger processor and better screen and finger print scanner and all those other 'nice to haves' need juice to run. The more you tack on, the harder the phone has to work, the hotter it runs and the crappier the battery life is. So I'm happy with the Sony XZ because it takes advantage of everything I want in a premium phone, has high-end specs that work in its beautiful design, and they made it so it works as hard without over doing it. All in all it's one of the best Android phones I've ever used, and I've used all the majors (Samsung, Motorola, and HTC) and none of them compare to this. I only hope it sells well so that Sony further invests in the US market because we've been waiting for high-end Android phones like the XZ for years.",35,"Sony"

"1286","B01M1HY1E3",4,"true","I bought this phone back in May when it was available for closer to $350, and so far I am very satisfied with it. I came from a mid-range Xperia before this (C4), and before that had an Xperia Z2. While I loved the software experience with both, I had issues with the camera and Bluetooth. I was excited to upgrade back to a flagship quality phone and so far things have been great. The 5.2"" display seems like a great compromise between some of the smaller options and phablets that have also graced the market. The screen on this phone is excellent. There is so much talk these days about AMOLED and other emerging technologies, but Sony still manages to make a killer IPS LCD display. There's simply no need for 2K or 4K on a phone in my opinion, so Sony doesn't waste their time on the specs competition with this device. Contrast is great, sunlight readability is perfect, and reviewing my pictures on the phone is always a very pleasing experience. This phone zips through day to day tasks incredibly well. It has handled everything I've thrown at it with complete ease. Sometimes the camera will load with a blank screen, but all I need to do is re-launch the app to resolve that . Other than that, I really am yet to deal with any software/functionality glitches whatsoever with this phone. The thing that really excited me about the Xperia XZ was the thought of getting a flagship-grade camera for a sub-$400 price. I was well aware of Sony's struggles with cameras on their phones, but I have always thought it was a bit overblown. The one thing that does drive me nuts about this camera is the wide angle lens. I see clear blur of foliage in the left corner of all the pictures I take, and it is incredibly frustrating once you notice it and effectively can't ""unsee"" it. While this is a known issue with wide-angle lens, there is no way it should be this prominent on what was once a $700 phone. Another issue I have with the camera is the postprocessing algorithm - photos usually come out over-sharpened, and textures tend to have a blurred, oil pastel appearance when zooming in. However, it's not all bad, as colors are reproduced very well and macro shots look fantastic. Battery life is above average for this phone, and can be great if you are willing to make some small changes. I have never had an issue getting through the day. I'm not someone who spends a ton of time on social media, but between Reddit, internet browsing, YouTube videos, GPS navigation and taking a lot of photos this phone has always gotten it done for me. I highly recommend installing an application from the Play Store called Greenify, which closes out all apps running in the background when your phone is not in use. It has definitely added the extra bump I needed to get through closer to 2 days instead of 1-1/4 with the original setup. Overall, I would recommend this phone at the $400 price point. There are some known concerns about the USB-C port on the bottom, but I think more than anything treating it fragile will be good enough to ensure it holds up. Beyond that, it's hard to pass up a phone that comes across as so reliable between the battery and software experience. I have never had an issue really with performance on a Sony device - their Android optimization is just that good. I definitely see this as being a nice, flashier alternative to some of the phones Moto has been putting out. If you want something with better all around specs yet that reliability of good software and battery, this is by far one of your best bets.",5,"Sony"

Great camera, overall phone feels quick and responsive. However I do want to make any potential US buyers aware. I am on the AT&T network and am unable to access their LTE network. After hours of troubleshooting with AT&T and on my own, many different APN settings, I have discovered the issue. Because it is a non AT&T phone they aren't likely to help you, but if you can get them to set your account an AT&T IMEI number, a demo phone maybe, or you could purchase a cheap LTE go phone, you could have it work then. You are simply tricking their network to think you are on an AT&T phone. I've had a lot of frustration so hope I can help out someone here.

First of all the phone looks very elegant and at first glance looks like it should be priced way above the current asking. Functionally it's great, I have not ran into any slow downs or hiccups. Setting it up was a snap and I had no problems throwing in a sim card from ATT and a micro SD for more storage and using it immediately. The screen itself has great contrast and can easily be used in direct sunlight. The built in speaker leaves something to be desired when listening to music but the built in headphone jack makes up for it, the built in speaker works great for speaker calls and general use.

Once you know that, you'll realize that sometimes it's a pain to connect to devices at first (it magically gets better over time), and if you leave BT on all day, it will drain your battery. However, that's my only complaint. Otherwise, this phone is fantastic. Oh yeah, one other thing - the led on the back (the flash and flashlight) is frigging hot. It's bright as hell, but if you ever try to use it to read your heart rate, you'll straight up burn your finger.",6,"Sony"

"1329","B06X9HVVC5",4,"false","This was just supposed to fill in for a few weeks for me until the new XZ1 Compact is released, at which point I'll either sell it or keep it as a backup. I put in my pre-order today, but I have to say I've been pleasantly surprised by this device, especially for the price (I picked one up open-box for under $200 on a certain auction site). It almost has me second guessing whether I really need to spend so much money on a high-end device. It's a little tall for my taste (taller than an iPhone), but the only thing I really miss here is a fingerprint reader. I'm not a big picture taker and I rarely do video calls so I won't comment on the cameras, other than to say that the few pictures I've taken look fine to my eye. Performance-wise, everyday tasks are pretty smooth about 95% of the time. It's packing 3GB of RAM, which is plenty for normal use. The CPU/GPU leave a little to be desired if you do any gaming. I normally play a couple of rounds of Hearthstone during the day and that really taxes this device, though it's still playable enough. For browsing, messaging, social media, and all that, you really don't need any more than this. Physically, as I said before it's a bit tall for my taste (can be a bit annoying in the pocket when sitting down) but the width and thickness are fine. The whole device really looks more high-end than it claims to be. The screen is pretty much edge to edge, which looks nice. The 720p resolution will get some laughs from spec snobs, but it honestly looks fine. In fact, with the mid-range CPU and the modest screen resolution, battery life is quite good, even with the relatively small battery. I'm typically still over 30% when I go to plug it in at bedtime. Anyway, it gets the job done for a pretty fantastic price, especially if you nab it on sale, and with an Oreo update confirmed from Sony it won't go obsolete on you as quickly as most mid-range Android devices do. Hard to argue against the XA1 right now if value is your top priority!",4,"Sony"

The only good thing I can say about the XA1 phone is the battery life is good, and still good after 1.5 years. Otherwise, performance is laggy and slow, like an old Droid X, and the touch screen is absolute trash. The right edge of my screen and my cascade button are all dead, and the home and back buttons are dying. Touch fidelity is terrible, and I have to really press down hard to register an input. It also really struggles to sync up with bluetooth devices. Say what you will about the poor app environment of Windows phones, but they were definitely better than this piece of junk.

"1360","B06X9HVVC5",3,"true","This review is not so much a review of the phone, which probably will work fine with the mobile operator of your choice, but a description of the challenge initially encountered to get it activated on the AT&T network. We purchased this phone as a replacement for a two year old Lumia 640 Windows phone which is still working fine but has dwindling app support. Day 1: Since the Xperia XA1 requires a nano-SIM card while the Lumia 640 uses a micro-SIM we visited our local AT&T store to get one. The charge for a new SIM card is currently $5. The agent stated that it would not work as AT&T does not support Sony phones. As we insisted it would, he inserted a SIM card in the Xperia XA1 with reported ""No service"". He then demonstrated that the SIM card was working by inserting it in an iPhone 8. We left the store somewhat frustrated but with the new nano-SIM card in the phone. We then contacted AT&T Tech support by chat. Level 1 was not able to make it work and offered to escalate to level 2. Level 2 suspected that the SIM card had already been activated in the past and stated that the issue would have to be handled by the ""Backend"" team and that it would take up to four hours. He promised to call back. As it was late we went to bed. Callback never came. Day 2: In the morning the Xperia still reported ""No Service"". We contacted Tech support again by chat. This time the agent reported that the ""Backend"" team had indeed done what it was supposed to and that the phone could now be activated. The phone was activated within a couple of minutes. HOWEVER, by the end of the day the phone was back to ""No Service"" Started another chat. Agent suggested getting another SIM card. Went back to store to get one. Still ""No Service"" Came back home. Started yet another chat. Another ticket was created. Day 3: After further chat with AT&T, agreed that the problem was probably an hardware issue. Contacted Sony's technical support which made me ""repair"" the phone (i.e. reformat it). It obviously did not help. Then Sony offered me to send it to a repair center in Canada for further assessment, which would take 14 business days (3 weeks including week-ends). I declined the offer and simply requested an exchange on Amazon, which was granted (Amazon service is great!). Day 11: Received new phone from Amazon. Moved SIM card in it and it worked right away. Most likely explanation is that cell antenna in first phone was defective or unplugged. To conclude: a good mid-range Android phone that works well on the AT&T network, but if the the one you get does not work properly do not waste too much time dealing with AT&T or Sony and just get replacement from Amazon... UPDATE 04-FEB-2018 One month later, replacement phone continues to work fine. Clearly the first one had an hardware issue. It is a good midrange phone and I am happy with the purchase but you should know the XA2 has now been announced by Sony and you therefore have to decide if you would rather purchase the XA1 today (at a discounted price) or wait a few weeks for the XA2 (and probably pay full price for it)... UPDATE 19-MAR-2018 The XA1 received the Android 8 (aka Oreo) update over the week-end and it works very well. Price has dropped further now that the XA2 is available for purchase. The XA1 is now a very good buy although you may want to spend more and get the XA2 if your budget allows.",7,"Sony"

"1363","B06X9HVVC5",3,"true","This phone looks good, isn't particularly heavy, and has a great camera. I purchased it for a year studying abroad so that I could use a sim card in the country I'd be studying in. It works well with vodafone and connects to the internet fine. This phone is great, if a little slow, and it doesn't have that much storage. This problem can be easily solved by purchasing a micro SD card. These are pretty cheap and I recommend getting one with your phone, especially if you want to listen to music or take a lot of pictures. The screen and the back of the phone do scratch quickly, so try to get a case or not put it in your pocket with keys. The real problem with this phone is the touchscreen. The corners and edges of the screen do not have any sensitivity. It takes a long time to press the enter key, and half of the time it will register as a nearby key (usually a period or the letter m). The backspace key is also on the side of the screen and it takes a while to get rid of these unintentionally typed letters. Sometimes you have to just lock the phone and reopen it so that it gets rid of the letters since backspacing is not possible. I've had friends try pressing backspace and enter and it doesn't work for them either, so it's not just my fingers. If you want to use the letter 'P' you're better off hoping the autocorrect knows what you're trying to say, since it takes ages to touch the screen just right and have it register. Get used to flipping the phone over to portrait mode and typing horizontally - it's the only way you can fully use the keyboard. If you plan on using this for a short trip I think you'll be fine, but if you want to use it for a long time the touchscreen issues really get annoying and I'm only a month into my year abroad. I hope it doesn't get worse, since I can't send it back or use the warranty while over here.",4,"Sony"

"1393","B06X9HVVC5",4,"true","I have been a Windows Phone user since 2012. I was lured by a few things - the design of the phones themselves, the customizability of the interface, the relatively low price of the handsets, and the superiority of Nokia imaging technology. My favorite of my Windows Phones was the Lumia 1020, possessor of the famed 41-megapixel camera. My most recent phone has been the Lumia 950, which has a 20-mp shooter. But things have been looking down for Microsoft's mobile ambitions of late, and I've been looking for an Android phone that would give me something close. The Sony XA1 wound up being my choice, based on design, value for the dollar, the claimed camera prowess, and dedicated shutter button. So how has the XA1 lived up to my expectations? In short, quite well, allowing for a few imperfections. DESIGN and HARDWARE My oh my, this is a pretty phone. The front is covered by a single sheet of Gorilla Glass. The screen is nearly bezel-less on the sides - not quite the effect of the new Samsung handsets, but quite close. The top and bottom do have quite tall bezels, but the effect is to make the phone tall and svelte-feeling. The back is a poly-carbonate with a metallic texture. The top and bottom edges, as well as the camera, feature a very understated chrome accent. The IPS-LCD, 5"" diagonal screen is 720p. This is a sacrifice to keep the price down, but to my mind it ends up not being much of one. The contrast level is reasonable punchy, with dark blacks and bright whites. At normal reading distances, I cannot see any jagged edges, and I have good vision. It is easy to read in most sunny conditions. It's not a premium screen by any stretch, but it looks good. Personally, I'll take increased battery life and decreased CPU load over a higher-res screen. The mono speaker at bottom is mediocre - but the headphone jack will give you the ability to supplement a great pair of headphones (none are included). USB-C is the connection for data and charging, and it is fast, functional and clicky-firm. All in all, if you show this to friends and ask them to guess how much it cost, I think most will overshoot the XA1's price. It looks really luxurious. CAMERA This is my number one priority in a smartphone. Sony has included the 23-megapixel Xmor RS sensor that formerly graced its 2015 flagship phone, the Xperia Z5. The back-side illuminated sensor is sized at 1/2.3”, and receives light through a f/2.0 aperture 24mm lens. These specs are comparable or superior to most flagships on the market in 2017, which is a big deal for such an inexpensive phone. If the sensor performs as well as it is specced, this makes the XA1 a real bargain for someone who prioritizes imaging over other features (which I do). All told, I would say that this sensor does mostly live up to the billing. In good lighting conditions, it wasn't far off in quality from my Lumia 950 (which launched for $549 18 months ago) and regularly equaled my wife's iPhone 7 ($649). Color is excellent, and detail is quite good. Low light performance is fairly good but not class-leading, though it is competitive with most of the mid-range competition. Attached you will see some sample shots I took (check the comments for an imgur link to full-sized snaps). 5x digital ""Clear Zoom"" is a hyped feature - predictably, it looks like garbage, as it does on any other smart phone. There is also the typical aggressive Sony edge enhancement when shooting in ""Superior Auto"" mode. This is attenuated somewhat in Manual mode, but not entirely. I wish Sony would ditch the edge enhancement completely, or at least allow RAW shooting. The single LED flash is OK as a last resort, but is not powerful enough to provide fill lighting when shooting subjects illuminated from the rear (as on a sunny day when the subjects are in the shade). At the end of the day, no camera, not the iPhone 7-plus, not the Samsung Galaxy S8, not even my beloved Lumia 1020, can equal the optics of a dedicated mirrorless or DSLR camera. But the XA1 is good to excellent for impromptu snaps, social media sharing, and macro photography, especially shooting in manual mode. PERFORMANCE The Helios P20 CPU provides smooth, stutter-free performance. I suffered no lags on regular tasks like Facebook, Messenger, web browsing, or light game playing (e.g. Threes). App switching and dismissal was buttery smooth. Heat generation is minimal. I was very pleasantly surprised, coming from a series of phones that use the Qualcomm Snapdragon series of CPUs. The 3gb of RAM probably helps, too, especially in crunching the numbers on the large camera sensor. Basically, I'd say this CPU/RAM solution equals or beats any 600-series Snapdragon. Battery life was quite good, probably owing to the lower-res screen and less power-hungry CPU. I just completed a long 14 hour day of heavy use with web browsing, photography, emailing, and text messaging - the battery is just under 50%. A day and a half should be easily reachable with medium use. The phone uses very little juice in standby - probably only 1-2% per hour. SOFTWARE Sony has shipped this phone with a lightly skinned version of Android 7.0 Nougat. While the Sony skin is inoffensive and is quite close to ""stock,"" I ended up going with the Square Home 2 launcher (pictured) to give me a more Windows 10-style feel. The phone handles this launcher like a champ, and I have noticed no increased battery drain. Manufacturer-installed software included a few Sony programs for Music, Photos, TV Schedules and the like, and all can be easily bypassed for other defaults if you don't like them. CONCLUSION The value for the money is pretty high here. You're getting above average for the price range camera performance and 3gb of RAM with otherwise mid-range internals. Android performance is snappier than many mid-range competitors. The build quality looks more expensive than it is. What are you giving up? There is no fingerprint scanner, you're not getting the ""brand name"" Snapdragon CPU, and the screen is less than 1080p. Since these are not high priorities for me, I find the value proposition here to be quite a good one. So the XA1 has some very nice aspects, a few sacrifices and no glaring issues. As such, I think 4 stars is a good rating. I don't think anyone who ponies up the asking price will feel cheated.",202,"Sony"

"1403","B06X9HVVC5",3,"true","I've had this phone for over 18 months now, it's been decent with one major drawback... My top pro: Truly unlocked phone. Doesn't come with all the junk you get with a Verizon phone for example (this one is actually GSM tho) All my previous phones have been from Verizon. They seem to lock out all of the good stuff (FM radio for example) so you have to use their services... I like that there isn't all that extra junk and software on it. The TOP con: My touch screen is bad... The phone is still fully usable, but quite annoying. I wish I had returned it or sent it in under warranty. The problem is that I cannot touch the edges of the phone very easily. Whenever I have to send a text with the letter ""P"" in it, it takes me a while because P is on the very edge of the screen. I thought it might be the protective case, but it does this in and out of the case. Within the last few months though, the top edge has started acting up. So now it's difficult to swipe down the top menu, I have to try several times. Again, this started while under warranty, but I was too lazy to deal with it at the time.",1,"Sony"

"1408","B06X9HVVC5",2,"true","This phone is not dependable. For the following reasons, after not even a month of usage, a) MOST of the time, calls are forwarded to a voicemail, b) camera does not focus every time, it has to be restarted or some time has to go by since last blurry picture for the camera to be able to gain focus again, and c) media volume is very low, it is hard to hear, even with the media volume at 100%. I figured it would be a good phone since I do not use it most of the time. Battery life can last for about 5-6 days for me, that is how often I use the phone. However, besides, calls being forwarded to a voicemail, I am unable to place a call successful, every time. For example, when I place a call, it looks like it is fine, the phone shows 'calling' on the screen but I cannot hear ringing at all. Sometime, I have to try a couple of times to make a successful call. Besides, it gets scratched very easily. Its quality is worse compared to for example any one of the Moto G phones I had previously. However, the screen on this phone seem to be good. I had purchased Honor 8 and returned it thinking that I will be fine with this lesser quality phone. But I was wrong, I purchased Honor 8 again and I placed a return order for this phone. Honor 8 is the most flashy (but very fast and well build phone) phone and it is worth buying and right now it is similar price as this phone. Doesn't make sense to keep this phone.",3,"Sony"

"1410","B06X9HVVC5",2,"false","I was hoping for a good replacement for my HTC M9 that finally died (another slightly buggy phone). T-Mobile had nothing worth the trouble as a replacement, so I went with an unlocked phone. I chose the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra for the camera; 23 megapixel. The Sony turned out to be merely ""acceptable"" as a replacement. It's got a great looking display. The display it's self is a little buggy, sometimes being unresponsive. The edge to edge touch screen is annoying (symptomatic of most edge to edge phones) and is compounded by the lack of phone cases available to chose from (not the phones fault, I know). It seems to have some issues multitasking media based apps. Occasionally the web browser (Firefox or Chrome) will lock up if YouTube is still in memory, for example. I'll have to clear recent apps to get the browser to work again. There are two big annoyances I have with the phone; one personal and one functional. First is the amount of Sony bloatware that is on the phone to start with. I mean, I get it, the manufacturer wants to give you a specific experience, but I really don't need news feeds, photo editing, movies, music... Basically anything that Google built in to Android OS is enough for me. That's a personal taste thing, I like a minimal and efficient setup. The second issue is the flash with the camera. Under some indirect or low-light environments the flash produces some whiteout on the edge of the photo. It so happens that this area is where the flash on the back of the phone is installed. It's easily defeated by turning flash off, and fortunately the camera is sensitive enough to work fairly well under low light conditions. Still, it's limiting. Overall, for my first Sony phone, it's been an acceptable, but not awesome, replacement phone.",4,"Sony"
"1411","B06X9HVVC5",5,"false","I've been keeping an eye out for a mid-range phone with a great camera for some time. Prior to the XA1 I had a Sony Xperia Z3 compact, but being 3+ yrs old, it was time to upgrade. The XA1 is a gorgeous phone. The screen looks amazing, despite the 720p resolution. The Sony UI overlay is simple and looks great. Build quality is absolutely stunning. By far the best feature of the XA1 is the camera - which is the same as that in the last-gen Z5 series (which got an 87 camera score on DxOmark.com). It launches extremely fast, and the focus / snap is by far the quickest of any phone I've ever used. My absolute favorite feature of this, and all Sony phones, is the physical camera shutter button. It makes it so much easier to take great pics, by pressing half way to focus, then the rest of the way to snap the pic. The pics themselves are very good. Low-light pictures are better than my past phones (LG G3, Xperia Z3 Compact) but still not perfect. I wish Sony would add OIS to all their phones - it would make the camera perfect. The other XA1 features are pretty standard, I'd say. I have had no problems with reception or use of the actual phone. Who would like this phone? If you want a mid-range, ""smaller"" phone with a great camera, look no further. I am very happy with my purchase after a week of use. There will be haters who are appalled at its less-than-flagship screen and processor. If you want those things, get yourself a XZs for $600.

Keep in mind that it is always charging at a desk or a night stand. Sony support sucked on top of that for a warranty service. They asked that we use the repair feature of their companion software which did not do anything, but before that, it didn't even do the backup. It didn't matter what computer we tried. somehow Sony support felt that is was software driven After hours of dealing with their software then they finally decided to have us send it in. Here's the kick, it takes up to 14 days to turn it around, they provide no loaner phone and this is only after 4 months of usage. What shall you expect when it is out of warranty?",NA,"Sony"

But unfortunately I am extremely disappointed with the performance of the phone. The phone itself looks good. But I am not sure why they have such extended bezels. The length of the phone could easily have been reduced by 0.5 inches without affecting screen size. The camera is very bad in night shots/indoor lighting. The images are distorted. Normal daytime pictures are alright. The response of the touch screen is not reliable. I am already having problems with upper portion of screen where the touch is not responsive. Simple things like connecting to a tele-conf line where you have dial multiple numbers in a sequence is difficult because the response of the number button is slow. All in all a very disappointing experience. I have been a fan of Sony products but did not expect this inferior product. Please look for phones from Xiaomi or Huawei in this price bracket",1,"Sony"

Looking at them The XA 1 still took the lead, but using the Iphone 6+ for about a year (I used a 6+ back when it first came out and then broke), and the feel is very differ. For 1. the 6+ had the main lacking of the Memory card slot, and relied on the ICould storage, Wail the XA1 can have the cards that get up to 258GB. 2. the camera on the 6+ was very nice and Enjoyable, using the XA1 camera with its 23MP setting made it seem more sharp cut edge. 3. the running on both are great and reliable. I do have to admit that the 6+ is more open for everyone that has Apple devices. The same applies for the android side. over all they both are good looking at the price the XA1 is cheaper and seems great.

Camera (far superior with 23 MP rear), size and resolution. It is also less expensive than this phone, I paid $175 for it when it was on sale on Amazon. In all respects, the Xperia L1 is a much lesser phone, but yet costs more. Cameras has less resolutions (13MP vs. 23MP) and feels plastic cheap in the hand. About the only thing that is better is the L1 uses USB-C for connection and charging, which is a better technology than micro USB. But that also presents a problem: you can find micro USB cable anywhere, but USB-C is a bit hard to come by. L1 also has less on-board memory, only 16GB instead of 32GB. Android is also much more exciting than iOS, the radio app alone should be a key consideration. Something the iPhone world could only dream off.

Sony's design language is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing. Personally, I adore it. The L1 is reminiscent of my last Clie PDA, thrust into the future. Build quality is excellent for this price range, and quite good relative to more expensive phones. There were no creaks or gaps to speak of, and the display is clear and bright. Their implementation of Android is not only current, but very thoughtfully left alone, for the most part. It isn't quite stock Android, but the UI very rarely gets in the way of letting you do things. Coming from an XZ, the slower CPU isn't too apparent in normal productivity use, but there is a substantial difference when you get into games and other apps that are more resource intensive. While I'd normally complain about the tiny 16GB storage, the addition of a MicroSD slot (which aren't present on some flagship phones, let alone one in this range) is excellent. Dropping a 200GB SanDisk card full of media gave me hours to put this phone through its paces. So, would I buy one? If money was a constraint, absolutely. I'm not giving up my XZ for it (and may still pick up the new XZ Premium), but as a replacement for a device that's two years old, or a first Android device, it's an outstanding choice.",3,"Sony"

"1564","B06XGZHSBS",4,"false","Call connection is clear, but the sound quality isn’t the best. The speaker is at the bottom of the phone and sounds fuzzy/muffled even on high volume. Headphones or a Bluetooth speaker are highly recommended for music. HD video playback can be laggy, especially without a good WiFi connection. The battery is terrible and needs to be charged daily if the phone is being used regularly. Conveniently, the L1 comes with a battery saver and data saver option that really help with the bad battery life. The slide the SIM card fits into is quite difficult to pull out. The manual says use your fingernails to pry the slide out, but I could not do this without tweezers. Aesthetically, the L1 is pretty. Rectangular, but with rounded edges, similar to the old Nokia Lumia phones. It’s also lightweight but the materials are on the cheap side, and the screen most definitely cracks if dropped in a parking lot. Overall, this is an excellent value-priced smart phone with decent visual appeal.",1,"Sony"
"1565","B06XGZHSBS",4,"false","This is our second Sony phone(other is last years xperia x, which I am a fan of other than battery life), I have the white version of this phone. the case is plastic and pearlized (gives a pinkish glow when light refracts off it giving it a femine feel.) The phone is as big as the xperia x in a case (little bigger than I like but wife thinks its fine and the rounded back helps, the plus of this is the screen seems a lot bigger. Where the x has rounded corners and rounded front glass the L1 the front is flat making the front corners more square and have a sharper feeling (could be negated with case). The phone is easy to set up and responds well (signalwise in a rural Ohio with ATT) you may want to check what bands are available in your area, some of the other models support more (when setting up the phone in store took a little as they don't see many Sony phones and are unfamiliar and curious) It is fine for your internet browsing, you tube videos, calls, texts, etc. the lower ram does hurt it's performance if you are trying to watch movies on this. This phone also does not support fast charging if you are use to that it will seem like a step back. One thing Sony does that a lot of other companies do not do, is it has the FM radio unlocked, plug in headphones and you can listen to the radio (is not as big of drain on battery nor does it use data to listen unlike streaming, a nice plus) I would recommend this phone for people on a budget or looking for a basic phone and something different. Side note and may not represent all experiences The phone was dropped twice by accident (cringed both times) once in the driveway gravel face down no scratches, and once waist high on back on concrete neither cracked the screen but I would recommend a case for this phone",7,"Sony"
"1566","B06XGZHSBS",3,"false","The phone is quite basic. It does have nice display, and the touch works well. Sound is OK. But this thing loses wifi signal and needs to be rebooted to connect again - shows authentication problem. It is not the signal strength - my other phone works perfectly right next to this one with no problems at all. The sound quality is not too good. I can hear the other side, but sometimes not very clear. Watching videos is a pain because of the poor sound. The phone is basic, so it lacks many features my Samsung S6 has. It does not have sensors to enable it to play many of the games and use it for 3D viewing (google Cardboard does not work due to lack of sensors). It has geomagnetic field, accelerometer, light and proximity sensors. There is no fingerprint sensor or heart and O2 sensors. It is noticeably slower. And screen resolution is way lower. I liked that there is much less software installed on the phone compared with Samsung.",2,"Sony"

"1590","B06XGZHSBS",2,"false","Not horrible for a low end phone but many complaints right out of the box. Bought this phone about 6 months ago and keep hitting more and more disappointments. Too many apps come with the phone and are not removable or movable taking up way to much on 16GB internal memory. The phone lags badly at times. Sometimes can not even connect to my home wifi when I am sitting right next to the router. Started having the phone just freeze up or be a blank screen, have to hard reset and hope the phone will re-boot, very stressful and very time consuming (very slow start-up if you ask me). In the past 2 months the charger has started acting up. Sometimes I plug it in and it doesn't acknowledge that it is even plugged in but immediately starts to overheat to the point that I have been burnt by the charger cord twice now while unplugging it (within 15-20 seconds of plugging it in), VERY SCARY! Do not leave this phone unattended plugged in. Now I am lucky when I can get the charger to work it will charge for hours and only charge about 25% above what it started at, very,very slow charging now (appears to be trickle charging when phone is below 30%).",2,"Sony"

"1594","B06XGZHSBS",2,"true","It was a pretty good phone, but then it froze and stopped booting up. There's a message saying that the System UI doesn't work anymore. Bought it ""New"", never dropped it, never tossed it around, never downloaded anything shady, probably downloaded only up to five apps anyways, barely used it. Seems that this isn't an uncommon problem for the Sony Xperia, but it's more alarming that this phone has become completely unusable in less than a month of use. Sony has a Software Repair program called Xperia Companion. Tried it a dozen times with different cables, different computers, restarting, reinstalling. Still didn't work. Talked to two different Sony representatives. Didn't really help, but they're also not technicians so it's understandable. I'm not really sure what they do, but you'll get more information from just searching on the internet so don't bother with them. They kept saying that it was probably due to my cables, my computers, my firewall, my anti-virus that I don't have, the USA market, a bunch of other reasons. I was probably talking to them for an hour and the only interesting thing either of them said was that it's probably a glitch. I just really wanted a refund at this point. However, Amazon was suuuper polite and helpful. I actually ended up opting for a replacement and hoping that the first one was just a dud. Probably the wrong decision, but I have to make use of all the crap I bought for this phone. I really wish I didn't buy this phone though.",2,"Sony"
"1595","B06XGZHSBS",1,"true","Horrible!",1,"Sony"
"1596","B06XGZHSBS",4,"false","Pros: Camera is slightly above expectations No bloatware Android 7.0 Nougat, With November 2017 Security Update Performance (for price point) Screen size Construction is all plastic, but very durable NFC USB-C Port Cons: No fingerprint sensor Face scanner doesn't work in low-light conditions Will not receive Android Oreo Does not include quick charger in the box Overall, I am very happy with the phone, especially at this price point. I believe this is one of the best value smartphones currently out, assuming you are not a power user. Sony is typically generous with software and security updates, but this phone will not be receiving Android 8.0 Oreo. The display on this phone is 5.5 inches, putting it in the size category of flagship phones. However, the screen resolution is only HD 720p, which is quite a bit below the pixel density of flagship phones. However, Sony is using a very good screen on this phone, with great white balance and viewing angles. I'm using the phone on AT&T, and it has full connectivity over LTE. The lack of a fingerprint sensor is an annoyance, but that is a reasonable sacrifice for such a good value. Facial recognition seems to work fine for me in well-lit areas, but does not work at all in low-light situations. Performance is what you'd expect for this class of phone - there are occasional stutters, but they don't hamper day-to-day use. Battery charges quickly with a quick charger, but the charger included in the box works at a standard, slow speed. The phone seems to hold a charge all day with normal use, which is in part due to the lower resolution screen. This phone includes support for NFC, which is quite rare at this price point. This allows you to use Android Pay in stores, as well as share files with other NFC-supporting phones. This phone is a great value at this price point, especially if you want USB-C and a large screen, but do not want a flagship. If you are looking for sheer amount of features, there may be better options at this price point. Sony quality, in my experience, is worth a small price premium.",1,"Sony"

"1598","B06XGZHSBS",5,"false","Great phone. I can't understand the few low reviews - not sure they are real. Sad. There is absolutely No bloatware on this phone. It is an unlocked...$200 dollar phone. Every app nearly every app is removable. I have had carrier Samsung phones crazy apps you cant use like GPS apps you pay for monthly to AT&T - crap no one uses. This phone has none of that. So refreshing. Other criticisms I see here ""phone is heavy"" and ""build quality"". Again, those things do not make sense. This phone feels every bit as well-built as my previous Samsung S7 Edge. (plus it cost less than just trying to fix my S7s cracked screen). The phone feelings awesome- it has some weight but it feels built like a tank. I could not recommend this phone more. Cheaper than a repair to your cracked ""premium"" phone - I feel like this phone is an absolute home run. Only downsides, no finger print scanner, and not lightning fast (but not at all sluggish). I am done buying the latest feature phone - this phone is that good.",9,"Sony"

One day it restarted and had lines on it that would not go away. Not only did the warranty not cover it but Sony basically said it was my problem. So before you buy this expensive coaster, please think again!!",NA,"Sony"
"1608","B06XGZHSBS",5,"false","I have used Sony Xperia smartphones exclusively for over four years including the Z ultra, Z3, T2 Ultra, Z1 compact and now the L1. All of them were excellent but this is my favorite so far. I did not order this phone from Amazon, I bought it at a retail store because my most recent smartphone was misplaced and I needed a replacement immediately. I generally do not run any background apps and always close them when not in use. I have noticed some minor bugs with all of them except this phone including some difficulty connecting to wifi networks when not in close proximity. They tend to show 3 or 4 bars of signal when detected but when I select ""connect"" it drops to one little dot and fails to connect. This will generally happen repeatedly until I either give up or move to better range of the router and it has been something I have learned to get used to but this doesn't occur with the L1. I think it has something to do with the new Mediatek processor. I was always irked by the need to pair with my bluetooth headset anew on my MacBook Pro every time I had paired it to my previous Xperia models which I thought was caused by Apple unpairing from it, but I do not have that problem with this phone. It seemed a strange bug, and I just got used to it. Now I can switch back and forth from my devices with my bluetooth headset very quickly and smoothly. I don't see the small apps when I tap the square and I don't miss them, now the square seems to only bring up background running apps so I can close them and save battery and performance. To me this is a welcome change. In all other ways it is the same old Sony user interface, simple, Spartan and neat. It has been the UI that has kept Sony Smartphones in my pocket for so long as my dependable tool in every situation. The display isn't 4k. It doesn't seem to me to be necessary to have an extremely high definition display for a handheld device, even for consuming entertainment media. It just eats through the battery and costs a lot. The display is still quite nice and in fact, I have noticed another improvement over my previous Xperia phones. When I select the dimmest back lighting with the slider it is much dimmer than with those previous models. It always seemed to me to still be more than adequately bright on the dimmest setting before and I had wondered if I could extend the battery life yet more by having it dimmer. Now I can. The touch sensitivity seems to me as responsive as any previous Xperia model. Very pocketable 5.5 inches. I have had a couple of phones which were excessively thin and have wondered if an extra couple of milimeters of thickness would be OK if it meant a slightly bigger battery. Well the battery is still only 2620 MaH. However with the toned down specs, smooth performance and average display it still seems to last as well as previous models if not better (excluding the T2 ultra which was just a beast). With the near lack of a bezel it is the perfect size for me as the T2 ultra was just too big. Excellent build quality. The matte black version feels great in my hand and at this price point for an unlocked phone I suspect that negative reviews are paid for by competitors. It feels like a very high quality device and not at all cheap feeling like a Samsung phone. It is elegant and yet durable. For $200 US, this phone is peerless. The camera is only adequate. This may be the most important detail for me. I am a photographer and I travel with several cameras and lenses, including some highly portable combinations so I simply have no need for an overblown and expensive smartphone camera. If I need to snap a quick shot of something, it is fine and has a flash in case lighting is insufficient for a shot. For those of you who need an incredible camera on your smartphone, I will try to keep my disdain to myself and suggest one of the models designed for selfies for your instagram but this model will achieve decent shots if you need it to.",1,"Sony"

"1611","B06XGZHSBS",4,"true","I purchased this as an upgrade to a Moto G4 Play which was running LineageOS 14.1 (AOSP 7.1.2 Nougat). I needed a phone with a more reliable GPS, and the NFC option (for things like Android Pay) greatly enticed me (though I've yet to really try it out just yet). After having the phone a few days, here are my thoughts: + The Xperia L1's GPS includes GLONASS (Russian satellite support), something the entire Moto G series desperately needed. Satellite lock is almost instant and very accurate. The L1 also has a magnetometer (digital compass) which was absent in the Moto G series. + The Xperia L1's screen, while lower pixel density (267ppi vs 294 on the G4 Play), has much better color saturation. The screen is also half an inch larger, ideal for using Nougat's multi-window mode. = The L1's 13MP camera is about on par with the Moto G4 Play's 8MP camera when using auto-focus. However, the manual shot mode on the L1 does appear to have a decent array of options which might give it a competitive edge in the hands of an experienced photographer. = The Xperia L1 comes with Android 7.0 out of the box, while the G4 Play claims it will update to 7.1.1 through standard OTA. Motorola has had numerous delays in deploying this update, hence the initial need to use a custom ROM. There aren't too many differences, honestly, and the L1 is already getting a steady stream of support updates, making them evenly matched in software. = Bluetooth problems seem to be inherent on all Nougat devices right now, including Google's own flagship Pixel devices. The G4 Play running Lineage 14.1 will often disconnect from Bluetooth when connecting/disconnecting a Wi-Fi network, and phone calls on Bluetooth can occasionally force a reboot. Meanwhile, on the Xperia L1, the connection is stable but much shorter. Audio becomes finicky as far away as 5 meters on a device with a max range of 30 meters. = The L1's USB-C connector is still using the 2.0 standard, giving it roughly the same data transfer and charge rates as the G4 Play's MicroUSB port. However, the Type-C port feels a lot sturdier than the old MicroUSB port, which justifies the necessity of newer (better) cables. - The L1's MediaTek 6737T, despite having better benchmarks than the G4 Play's Snapdragon 410, has considerably more lag. This was a major disappointment for me as someone who uses their phone for EVERYTHING. Apps take a bit longer to open, and the keyboard has a slightly poorer response rate. - The L1 has a glass screen with a hardness of 6. However, it's so thick that if you try and place a tempered glass screen protector on top of it, the touch screen struggles to register much of anything. This means you need to go without and be a lot more careful than you would need to be with the G4 Play, which happily accepts tempered glass screen protectors. Is the Xperia L1 worth $200? I would say it's worth close enough to $200 not to matter. It more than makes up for the limitations of the Moto G4 Play, though it would have done better with a processor to match. It can beat out some phones in its class (like the Nokia 3), but other phones (like the upcoming Moto E4) might give it a run for its money (provided Motorola does not make the same mistakes twice).",78,"Sony"

This L1 is so great that it makes me writing this long review, also my first review for online shopping. Sony's software engineers did great work making that Android System so comfortable and very user-friendly. This L1 is cheaper than the other two phones, but it feels faster than my Galaxy S7, which has a lot better hardwares even is made 1yr before. There is no glitch or crash, and everything is so smooth to run. I can only give 4 stars because of the camera. After all, it's an affordable smartphone, I don't expect too much.

"1633","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","While it has only been a couple of weeks of ownership I am really liking this device. I had first seen its release in Barcelona at MWC where it won Best of Show. I also had one of the first Xperia Z's which had been a lukewarm experience over time and kept me out of returning to Sony, until now. Some random observations are as follows: This isn't my primary phone and more of backup, leisure/weekend and travel device. I'm indifferent on the current lack of the fingerprint recognition and quite pleased that it has a dedicated camera button. I really like the dual SIM (currently one prepaid SIM and one data-only SIM). Strong dislike for carriers means I can ditch either/or both SIMs/accounts without recourse. I expect with frequent travel I'll continue SIM swapping for location. I love the beautiful display for video watching as well as its overall design. I'm not yet sure if I've watched anything in 4K. WiFi reception is quite good whereas Bluetooth music/streaming connections seems less strong than the iPhone/iPad. Works as expected with Chrome/Google Cast which is particularly important to me. It is heavier than I expected which I actually appreciate (heft). However, given weight and beautiful/slippery finish I've found a case is necessary (don't like cases on flagship devices). Overall, and so far, a great device for my needs/wants.",3,"Sony"

"1648","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","coming from the HTC 10 the this phone is leaps ahead in my opinion and that phone was a beast also. Beautiful display, quality build, the battery is amazing I've only charged it once since Sunday and this is posted on a Thursday, and that's with browsing, photos, slo-mo videos, and installing all my apps (at 30% since Tuesday at time of review). My HTC 10 would of needed charging at least 6 times, one of the reasons I upgraded to this. I keep Bluetooth on all the time(which has better range, faster to connect to devices and sounds way better streaming to my car radio.) I also keep Wi-Fi on all the time. Everything works like it should, love the ""lifelog"", been using that since I got it. The remote play works flawlessly to your PS4 f you have one. Another selling point for me. Signal is strong, I have full bars most of the time where my HTC 10 never was really full. The screen is top notch, I don't see what the point of the new edges, that would cause me problems more than anything, I like my bezels. The screen hue/colors even on normal are great, there's also a vivid color mode that even brightens that up, Ill stick to normal though. 4k display and the HDR samples were beautiful. The camera 960fps slow motion is awesome I was playing with it at a theme park and got some great videos. Vr effects are pretty cool and more are downloadable. The apps on this phone are minimal, its not loaded with games and other useless apps, there is a couple but they are great apps, like the lifelog, movie creator, news, etc. I really like how its more of a stock google experience, the dialer and messenger are close to stock or if I'm wrong stock google. Icon packs can be purchased from the play store and used, no need for launchers like Nova and the like, so that's customizable. Dpi is editable, same with icons grid and sizes. some cons: the new sony lenses, they will be in other devices also, will have a minor distortion to straight line objects, not really noticeable unless your looking for it, and if your picky can be fix with minor image edits. sony has commented on this and says its just the way the new lenses will be, and will start being visible on other devices as they are used. they will look to improve in the future. software updates may also help. Me personally only notice when trying to duplicate it to show someone. normal photos I took looks great. another is it is a fingerprint magnet. Trying to find an good case at this point has been a challenge, have a few more on order to see if they are better. speakers could be a bit better, but I've been using HTC boom sound for years, these match up to the HTC 10 but not so much the front facing older gen HTC phones, cant compare to U11 since ive never heard one. But using headphones or Bluetooth audio it seem the Sony does a better job at sound. I definitely will be using this phone till it breaks or goes too obsolete, which I doubt.",11,"Sony"

"1654","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","I recently purchased the Sony Xperia XZ Premium as a replacement for my iPhone 6. Simply put, the Sony is a superior product in any measurable way. Moving my iTunes library over to an Android environment was a bit of a pain, but that was the only challenge in this migration and it was successfully resolved within a day. The Sony phone's display is stunning, and 4K programming from Amazon Prime video is particularly impressive. Sound quality of music through my headphones is also noticeably better thanks to Sony's attention to audio playback. The phone's functionality is best described as lightening fast and very smooth. There is no noticeable lag as I scroll through websites or move from app to app. Some reviews are critical of the design, but I like the bezels and the overall look of the device. The Xperia XZ Premium also feels good in the hand and is easy to hold and operate. I have just started to explore the camera, but did have great luck taking shots from a ski lift the other day. The shutter button on the side of the device proved to be quite useful in doing that. Finally, it is also an excellent phone. We live in a part of Vermont noted for spotty coverage, but so far there has been no issue with dropped calls, etc. My iPhone was a bit more prone to cut out. In summary, do yourself a favor and look a bit beyond Samsung or Apple if you are in the market for a new phone. Consider the Sony Xperia XZ Premium.",3,"Sony"

It feels very premium and high quality in the hand. The 4K HDR screen is phenomenal especially when you turn on the super vivid mode combined with the X-reality engine on and full brightness. The screen blows away any other phone on the market and my colleagues who have S8 and iPhone 7s plus are blown away with the deep black levels, sharp contrasts and really vibrant colors. The battery life is quite good with the 3300 mAH battery. I get about 2 - 3 days out of it. Cameras both front and rear facing are amazing. I have shot some 4K HDR videos and pictures and they come out incredible. Have not tried the slow motion yet, but saw the stock videos it comes with.

Not to mention the really bad ergonomics of the edge screen. Whenever I reached across with my thumb typing one handed my palm would hit the curved edge and activate any button there. Very bad practical design, looks cool but in everyday practice was a nightmare. Xz premium looks amazing, is by far the fastest responding Android phone I've owned. The only thing faster seems to be a Google pixel. Not a Samsung hater here, I just found a better a phone for me. Camera is great, Sony software is light feeling and battery easily lasts a day and a half under normal use. I didn't get the US version, I bought an unlocked international version so the thumb scanner works. However I will say there is facial recognition on all of them that is super fast as well. No issues with international version, have had the phone for 2 weeks. Literally took the Sim out of my s7 popped it in the Sony, turned it on, told it to look for att network and boom, done. LTE on my existing att data plan. Didn't have to call anyone or go-to the att store. I'm not a techy person, it was easy.. anyway, couldn't be more pleased with this phone. Oh the camera is amazing too!",29,"Sony"
"1663","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"false","Let's get the really important stuff out of the way first: I love my new phone. It's super fast and the screen is beautiful. Now for the details. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium is a top-of-the-line phone with the latest (for now) processor and a 4K display. Because the ROM is not delivered by my carrier (which means an additional layer of testing), it's always going to be more up to date; in fact, several updates have been pushed out since I started using the phone about a month ago. So if you want an authentic Android experience with the latest bells and whistles, you won't be disappointed. Sony has added a couple things on top of the stock Android but it's not loaded with bloatware and the Sony-specific stuff doesn't get in the way. I lose T-Mobile's Wi-Fi calling feature, but T-Mobile's network is better than it used to be so I don't miss it. The phone does have a bezel all the way around and the market is moving away from this toward screens that go all the way to the edge, but I personally don't mind. It makes it easier to fit a case on it, and easier to handle. It's still lightweight and slim in my pocket. Battery life/battery management is the best I've seen in several generations of smartphones. By way of example: I started one morning with a full charge. During the course of the day I drove from Southern California to Las Vegas, a 4-5 hour drive, using Waze the whole way with the screen on the entire journey. I also used the phone as usual the rest of the day, reading news, sending texts, etc. When I went to bed that night I had about 20% charge left. I was extremely satisfied with the battery life that day and every other day too. One reason why battery life might be so good is because of the battery care mode: The phone will charge slowly if you plug it in overnight; this minimizes heating up of the battery. The camera is really good too. Picture quality is excellent but what really sets it apart is the video recording. It'll do full HD at 60 fps and 720p in two super slow motion modes: 120 fps with the ability to adjust slow-motion playback after capture, or a ""one-shot"" mode where you press a button during recording to capture about one second of action at 960 fps. So to reiterate: 4K pictures, full HD video at 30 or 60 fps, or slow motion at 720p. There are also many settings to explore in the camera to customize your experience, too many to list here. Sony has succeeded in creating a flagship phone that competes well with the market leaders. I look forward to seeing more from them.",2,"Sony"

"1672","B06Y2GX8K8",1,"true","I know Sony lovers will hate my review. But this is the truth about this phone: It's a joke. I used many phones and almost every flagship phone, and thought this phone at least may compete with some good phones, but it's not. I think sony lives in its own world to price this phone 800$. I used it for less than an hour to decide to return it. At the time of writing this review, it's the most expensive phone among its similar phones and the least to give you value for your money. I compare it to S8+, U11, G6 and even Axon 7 , and all better than this phone. Design wise: It's ugly, huge and wastage of space. And the front facing speakers don't justify the size. Speakers: Sony is raving about them, but they are the worst and weakest I've ever heard. Camera: Poor interface and poor quality. You have dig into menus for basic things. Make it useless. Screen: come on. No comparison to the S8+ ir even the U11 or axon 7. All better. Interface: Just look at the S8+ and you realize how much sony is poor. They even don't include headphone. For 800 dollars this is a joke phone. Do your self a favor and try something else before committing to this overpriced phone. Pleae note: I'm not a Sony hater. In fact all my cameras and lenses are Sony. However when you use this phone, you realize that sony is either cheating its customers or they don't know what they are doing. I'll give you an example: They have great hopes for the camera to the point they put a dedicated button for it. However, you can not pause the video while recording, no Kelvin WB, no good menu and many basic stuffs are missing. The sony engineers did not bother to look at other manufacturers interface, like LG and Huawei so they inspire them. I""m not sure even if the sony employees use sony phones. For the 1st time I test a phone and from the 1st few minutes I realize I was deceived by its manufacturer. The axon 7 was sold for 329 and this trash for 800!

"1674","B06Y2GX8K8",4,"true","The speakers on the XZ Premium, though stereo, are No match for the HTC One line of phones front facing speakers. XZ Premium loses low end detail that HTC had. This might be due to the XZ Premium's all Glorilla Glass build, instead of metal on HTC. The stock keyboard is not intuitive when using the swipe to type function. It has an error rate of 40%, I'm constantly getting the wrong words suggested to me. The screen could be larger as it is bigger than the current iPhone #+. But then again the extra mass is probably attributed to the fact that it's a gaming phone also and it's comfortable to hold when in landscape orientation. It's a wide phone to hold and use one handed. The store I ordered from was a good price at $599 flat, New. I'm satisfied with the ordering and delivery process . The native gallery functionality is the worse. The native file manager app is confusing to use when filing photos and videos together. You have to be familiar with tech just to understand how to navigate the file manager. The phone is a solid 4 stars. Not easy to use but the battery life is decent for a continuously on 4k screen.

Battery last's all day even with heavy use (I listen to music while running deliveries 4-6 hours a day) and I come home with ~65% battery. If you are looking for a great phone and don't need a bunch of bloatware or a heavily skinned Android version I can honestly recommend this phone.",3,"Sony"
"1676","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","Best phone ever with a few tweaks. I went from the s8+ to this after researching all the smart phones on the market. After a few tweaks the finger print scanner is amazing and best position ever on a phone. This can be enabled without rooting the device. Just flash European firmware to the phone. I didn't like how the navigation buttons were so luckily the phone was able to have these swapped with an app so my back button is now on the right side and also added more buttons on the bottom to open apps of my nav bar. If your into customizing your phones this is the phone for you. The camera button is awesome as well. The speed makes my s8+ seem slow. Holding it is a lot more comfortable is well. Added gestures for quick launching apps and scroll bar of apps at bottom. I couldn't of asked for a better phone. The mirrored back and 4k video is amazing if your into vlogging etc. So if you spend a little time researching this phone on how to enable a few things or just buy the UK version you will be in for a treat.",10,"Sony"

I can't speak for any other smartphone, but the XZ's camera is a disappointment. Sony dropped the ball on the software end of it. I've wrapped my XZ in a LoveMei case and couldn't be happier with the duo. 1/2 in rubber surrounding phone with cast alum plates top and bottom. Bulky, you betcha. Machine shop ready, I think so. Update: 6 months in and things are still going great. I have even come to be very pleased with the camera. The ability to bring up the camera by double tapping the power button it awesome. The super slow motion camera has been amazing. From RC cars to CNC machines, Ive taken some impressive clips. The trick is to get a super bright LED light that only has an on/off switch with nothing fancy. Super slow motion will pick up the frequency that some LED's use to control their brightness. The LoveMei case has been a god send. The case includes its own glass screen that has a protective, two layer mesh that keeps the phones microphone and speaker protected from the outside world.

The chrome finish turns a lot of heads too which can be kinda fun. The xperia fork of android is minimalistic without being bare so the device is very clean cut and smooth running.

"1688","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","This phone is amazing in many aspect, although there are also some downside. However, it's really nice of the vendor to send me a selfie stick along with this phone, so thanks for the extra item! As always, the fingerprint wasn't available for the US version due to legal issue in my guess and pretty much the only downside of this phone. Phone comes with near stock android, which is one of the best, and you can disable pretty much the few Sony apps if you want to, though some are useful, especially if you're using for PS4 remote play. The feel of the phone is really solid, slight heavy but that's how I like the feel, making the phone feels really premium. This phone doesn't overheat on my use so far, unlike the problem in the Z5 Premium. Battery last me pretty much from morning wake to night bed time, and I'm a heavy user so this is really good. If you're a minimal user, this phone could easily last up to two days. My network speed for this phone is ridiculously fast in comparison to other phones out there. Speedtest with above 60mbps and up to 100mbps on my LTE network alone. Charging is also fast, half an hour charge for the phone gives about 30+% and that can last a few hours. Camera is snappy, although I haven't get a chance to test in many condition yet so I can't really say much on that at the moment. The large bezel is a bit of a let down since this is in 2017, but considering this phone belong to the XZ family design language, that can be overlook. It would be nice if Sony actually have the notification LED in a different location that's not too obvious since the LED for this phone is very awkward positioned (If you get the black color this is not going to be an eyesore). All in all, I'm really happy with this phone, SD835, 4GB RAM, 64GB+microSD, 4K resolution, a day worth of battery for heavy user, it got all the things I need...for now.... Pro: Snappy 4K eyecandy screen Choice of Dual-SIM or SIM+microSD Solid feel Long battery life Fast charging That LTE speed+++ Low on bloatwares (Can be disable) Bright screen Nice Contrast and color display Cons: No fingerprint (still...)

"1689","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","I. LOVE. THIS. PHONE. My husband says that I cannot manage to have a cell phone without problems, so he bought me this Sony. I had never heard of a Sony cell phone, but I own many other Sony products such as TV's, Sound systems and even my Sony a7R II full frame camera. One of the things I love about Sony products, besides the obvious high quality, is that they seamlessly work together. There is no confusion pairing this phone with any other Sony product to cast images, video etc., which by the way, is incredible. I have never had a cell phone with such good low light camera or video performance. The 4k video is out of this world! I also love the simplicity of the design of this phone. The size, color and design combination makes this phone look so sleek and upscale. The indented power button is so much easier to use (in my opinion). I really don't give a rat's tail about not having a fingerprint scanner, but I am sure people in Europe love it. I LOVE the dedicated camera button, and the sound quality is unbelievable for a cell phone. Comparing it to every other cell phone I have owned in my life, there is no lag when opening apps, or anything else for that matter. I have no problem sharing long videos via text message, email or social media platforms. This phone can even handle uploading, storing, and viewing the images taken with my a7r II, which is a full frame 42 mp camera!!

"1693","B06Y2GX8K8",2,"true","So I essentially chose this phone in hopes that the camera would be amazing. It is not. Sony's stock app is pretty bad. It doesn't even allow you to take full control of the camera. The ""superior auto"" mode is honestly only good for taking pictures with decent perspective with no effort. And that's only sometimes. Most pics I take with the ""superior auto"" mode are blurry. You're better off using the auto settings in manual mode. Also, there is a bug on Sony's end that doesn't allow 3rd party apps to utilize the full resolution of the back camera when using the Camera2 API. So I'm stuck with 8 MP and custom settings, or 19 MP and terrible to decent settings. So basically, I paid ~$700 for this phone in hopes that the camera would be great. But I couldn't even tell if you if it's actually great or not, because I can't fully utilize it. And from the research I've done, this phone isn't the only Sony phone with the issue. I took a chance on Sony, and I deeply regret it. Pros: 4K screen is pretty nice Audio recording is far better than my previous phone (S6 Active) 960fps slow-mo in great lighting is kinda awesome Cons: Cannot fully utilize camera 960fps slow-mo is generally useless The camera doesn't do well in low light. I can see the grain in the shadows even when I'm zoomed out of the pictures I take. I never had this problem with my S6 Active. Honestly, I'll never buy another Sony phone.

(1 month after purchase) -Performance and quality are instantly noticeable. -Pictures look great (front and back camera) -Slow-motion camera is amazing. If you time it just right, you've got yourself an awesome Instagram video. -I don't know why other people complain about the design, but I think it's stylish. -A lot more memory for storage. -I can go at least a day and half without charging my phone. (with Bluetooth on and about an hour worth of YouTube videos throughout my day) My only complaint: -I've had trouble with my Bluetooth connectivity to my car.When I'm listening to music, it sounds like a scratched CD because it skips and lags. My music plays just fine using an AUX cord, and it's not my car's Bluetooth because it never gave me that problem with my previous phone. I've read online that a lot other people have the same issue with other flag ship phones as well. It's really annoying that I have this problem. Minus one star for this.

The only drawback for this phone is it's camera although doing great shots in daylight, it tend to produce poor image quality in low-light conditions. The focusing is also not very good, lots of images are out of focus whenever used in Auto or manual focus. mode. My older Note 5 does superior photos not sure why Sony cannot do the same. Slow motion video is great feature when you least expect it to capture important moments in life of your family and friends. The phone itself works good the only problem is a contact app which for some reason freezes sometimes upon pressing app button and then unfreeze and self-call the last contact I pulled from the list before. The sound quality is really good that is probably because of both speakers being installed in the front face of the phone watching the videos experience excellent with clean clear straight sound.

"1698","B06Y2GX8K8",1,"true","SONY FAILS IN WARRANTY - DON'T RECOMMEND BUYING SINCE 2 TRIPS TO ITS REPAIR SERVICE RESULTED IN MY PHONE BEING SENT BACK UNFIXED. TWICE! Bought phone in November 2017. Was excited to try 4k screen. Reviewers raved about it, saying the resolution was stunning and that the difference was definitely noticeable. Not the case! The screen quality was just not that great, colors were bland and resolution was not noticeably different from a QHD screen. Was using the ZTE Axon 7 prior to switching to the Xperia XZ Premium. Immediately disappointed by the screen!! The ZTE Axon 7 uses AMOLED while Xperia XZ Premium uses LCD. With phones side by side playing the same videos in each respective resolution (4K on Xperia, QHD on Axon), the Axon 7 consistently had better looking images, with much richer blacks and contrasts. The difference in resolution is not noticeable, as much as I tried to see the differences between QHD and 4K, It was so minute I had to pause the videos and look very closely at the images to spot the slightest differences. In other words, it is a useless spec that looks good on paper, but underperforms in real world, because the AMOLED QHD screen on the Axon 7 looked better in every way. Even the HDR looked poor. I preferred the non HDR video coming out of the Axon 7's screen. Decided to keep the Xperia XZ Premium for the overall experience, decent camera, great processor, good OS without too many bloatware, water proofing etc. It is a decent phone overall, however, the GPS functionality decided to stop working all together, and this is where the nightmare began. Phone does not get any signal at all from satellites and so using Google Maps or any other location based service is useless. We all know how important GPS functionality is today on a phone, it is a feature we cannot be without. Called Sony and they recommended a full factory reset using their computer software that you download. No fix. Called Sony and they sent me a FEDEX label to ship phone to their repair center. Keep in mind they do not offer a loaner device, so I had to figure that out on my own. Sent phone, did not receive any news from them for 3 weeks. Call to get an update and they say that all they know is that the phone is in the repair shop, but they don't know the status. Another week goes by and I call and implore them to fix the phone already and send it back. They say they will try. Phone is sent back to me a few days later, and the paper from the repair shop says ""repaired, software reinstalled"" . Pop in SIM card and restart phone and GPS has SAME PROBLEM. Call them again and begin process again to send it back. Talk to a supervisor who states that the technicians do check and ensure phone is working properly. He states that if they cannot fix it, they will replace it. Send the phone again, and wait weeks before they send it back. Guess how it came back? Unrepaired!! Paper from repair shop said ""no fault found"". So in conclusion, this has been the worst cell phone experience I have ever had. And there is no way I will ever buy a phone from Sony again or any other product, since they failed so miserably in providing a warranty they claim to have.",1,"Sony"

Just think USB3 (the blue one) - but you don't have to wonder if your plug is upside down or not. Simple as that. And its pretty fast on its own, easily making it an essential piece, especially now given its becoming a new Universal norm. - The display is pretty, sharp, clean and responsive. - The camera is very nice and does some neat things with lighting in darker places, although you have to hold the phone perfectly still for a moment to let it 'Slowly' take its enhanced picture.

"1700","B06Y2GX8K8",4,"true","I am one of those people that are not tied to one brand or OS. I have had several iphones, sony, Samsung Note, Windows CE, etc. I was using a Note 5 and was eagerly awaiting the Note 8, but the placement of the fingerprint scanner and the rumored price turned me off. The new iPhone that is coming out intrigued me, but ultimately decided to pass (I use an iphone 6 for work). So I decided to give Sony another shot (previously owned a Z3). Asthetics - I actually do not mind the look of the Sony line despite the bezels and find it appealing. From the Note 8 and iPhone 8 leaks I think they will look better, for other than that I prefere the Sony look over other brands. Screen - the screen is gorgeous, but these days which major phone brand doesn't? The detail of viewing netflix in 4k is amazing though, although may be overkill with a small screen. Processor - Fast and fluent, no complaints, but it is the current Snapdragon that is coming out on the android phones. Camera - Love the fact they still have a dedicated camera button on the side, always enjoyed the software. I have not really come acress the distortion issue that some are experiencing. Video - This is where it shines, the 960 slow mo function and recording video in 4k is fantastic. I am disappointed that the fingerprint scanner is disabled in US versions, but there is a way around that with the firmware. Plus, with Gear S2 Classic, you can set it so you can unlock phone without passcode if you are within so many feet of your watch is nice. Overall, I like the phone, I would have liked to get the new Note 8, but I am not looking forward to spending roughly $1100 on new phone.",13,"Sony"
"1701","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"false","I took my time before I reviewed this phone because I've been searching for a phone I'd really like to use with ATT's Go Phone packages (prepaid). I understand they've dropped that name now but they still have the same pre-paid packages under a new name which I'm sure you can google should you be interested. First the much vaunted 4K screen. Well...it's stunning! It makes everything pop out in crystal clarity which is good on these tired old eyes...I know She Who Must Be Obeyed wasn't impressed...she said why would you want 4K on a tiny screen...but after she saw the clarity and the detail she too agreed that for our age group it's a real treat after all! It's fast as lightning on every app I've run so the processor is more than adequate. The body styling is classic and elegant. It's large, so you'll need to take that into account. I can't just slip it into my shirt pocket like I did the iPhone 6 it replaced (I'm done with Apple). The camera is incredible and can do all kinds of things. Of course I don't ever use it, I just tried out all the cool stuff for the review and I was impressed with the quality of the photos and the simplicity of using all the cool extras (thanks to my grand daughter who walked me through it step by step...she was really impressed with the 4K video capability). If you're like me you'll be glad to hear it has a dedicated camera button. The pictures are so good I'll probably use it to take up to date snap shots of the grand kids and everybody else in the family when they happen by. My grand son plugged his VR Headset into it (I didn't even know you could do that) and played a game and said that it was the best VR he'd seen coming from a phone...and he emphasized ANY phone...and he's tried them all...trust me. He did say that if you want it for the VR it's as good as any platform he's seen but you'll want to get at least 64gb Ram . He also said the sound reproduction on the phone was way way better than what he has on his iPhone 7 and that the 3.5 has to be the best he's heard. The battery life is very good with my only having to recharge it about every three days, but then I don't make 30 calls a day or text 100 messages to my friends. The twin stereo speakers that are built in are pretty darn good because I can distinguish dialogue in a movie I watched on the 5.5 screen (which when you're watching video is bigger than it sounds). It's not Carnegie Hall but it's a big improvement over my iPhone. I like the fact that you can access your carrier card from the side (tiny slot and you do have to learn to open and close it right) without having to go to the hassle of opening the back of the phone...especially if you keep a cover on it at all times like I do. The Xperia is a Sony product and to me that means quality. The XZ is the best of the line and certainly deserves 5 stars if not more as far as I'm concerned. Bottom line is that I highly recommend this phone from personal experience and constant use.",4,"Sony"

I will have to monitor the updates and hopefully they will fix the problem that worsens the sound. Music should have two speakers and speakerphone volume should be loud.

"1705","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","A great phone. Purchased after 4 iPhones over the years. Also thoroughly reviewed the newest Samsung and LG phones, and did like the Samsung, but not as much as this one. The 4K display is at the cutting edge, and those who say ""Who needs 4K on a tiny phone?"" have no idea the difference it can make! If you ever want to use a VR 3D viewer, then you'll SO notice the difference. And even if you don't, you'll see details you never saw on other phones. The design/styling is very ""Bauhaus"" and looks simple and elegant. Classic even. I really like the Galaxy too, but I'd call it a little over-styled. I like the curved glass edges on the Samsung - yeah, they're cool - but they can also be a source of reflected glare, making edge details hard to see or read. And while some don't like the edge bezels on the Sony, I think they look clean and refined. I also found that - holding the Samsung - I'm constantly covering up information on the screen edges that I want to see. On the Sony, I do wish that the speaker volume were a little louder, but it is very usable. I use some Sony headphones I've had for years, and they have a decently high 'sensitivity' rating, about 105 db, which gives a really strong volume for music and videos - it is not the least bit weak. I can blast my ears off with it. I think some may be using low sensitivity headphones, which can sound great with a lot of power - but they tax the power of weaker headphone outputs. Try a headphone with good sensitivity, and you'll be happy. The Camera is everything you could ask for in a modern phone - perhaps a half notch below that of the Galaxy. Not perfect, but nothing is - still excellent. And it does have that ultra-slow 960 fps slow-motion, and the 4K is outstanding. I have no issues with the still camera, the autofocus, and other features. But I have an excellent big camera for when I need true pro features. No phone is there yet, but they are improving each generation. And the XZ Premium still comes very close in quality to low-level pro cameras, and might actually be overkill for personal use. Speed of use is SUPER FAST opening apps, checking mail, using the phone, browsing - even viewing images and videos in full 4K - all you could want and more. Snapdragon 835 is no slouch - neck and neck with the very best! The touch screen is effortlessly smooth and a pleasure to use, gestures interpreted well. So you don't think I'm only positive, here's the mostly minor other side... I do hope that Sony will fix a few things in their First firmware update: 1. Do boost the volume, and dispense with the unnecessarily low 'loud limit,' which is too low (though you can always override it). Don't forget the ringer volume (or louder ringtones please?). 2. Make the Fingerprint Reader work for US customers!... What, are we so inferior to Europeans, Brits, and Japanese in your eyes, Sony? Not a deal-breaker, but really?? 3. Give us full control of the Resolution and Audio Settings for the phone, so that we can decide when full resolution - 4K - is important, and when battery life is more important. Sony can't know when we NEED something, but we are capable of making that choice ourselves, I think. 4. I'd take a few more ""modern"" ringtones, but I can do that myself ... If you use your phone a LOT, and the display image is important to you, then this is just about the only phone that jumps ahead in resolution - and the other phones WILL be upping theirs (perhaps in another generation or two), but the Sony has 4K now ... The stereo speakers will not knock your socks off or power your Block Party, but they are nice if you want a medium low background sound, and it's in Stereo. And the audio sounds beautiful and powerful through good, sensitive headphones or most any stereo input. It feels great and solid in your hand, and it can be operated with just one hand, though two is better due to size. The menus are really not bad at all - just takes a few minutes to get it after 4 iPhones. No prob. I'm loving this phone. I just can't stop myself finding reasons to look at everything on the 4K display. (3840 X 2160 pixels!) A very few detractions, but still five stars.",116,"Sony"
"1706","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","Summary: Great phone for the money. Shipped from Amazon, on time and in great condition. No faults can be seen on the device or its original packaging. Phone Review: This is definitely the best Sony phone to date, it comes with all the latest flagship specs. The only feature it's missing is wireless charging but I'll gladly stick to the general standard of plugging in the phone directly. One of the main contentions with buying the US model is the use of the fingerprint sensor. Truth be told, the hardware is there but the software (US firmware) prevents the use of it. To gain this functionality, I flashed a foreign firmware onto the phone using software from the XDA developers forum. Its fairly easy and once you download the necessary flashing software and firmware, the process literally took less than 10 - 15 mins. PS. If anyone needs advice on this, feel free to drop a comment. The camera is definitely an improvement over my Z5, it captures at low light much better, 4K video stabilisation has definitely improved and HDR although it may not be as well executed as the Google Pixel, still it shows improvement over the Z5. The 960 fps slow motion is breath-taking even though it is shot in 720p the level of detail seen in a slow motion shot will give you a greater appreciation for the finer details in life. The phone's display is superb, 4K videos are astounding and even though the general interface is in standard 1080p you won't be bothered by this as the colours are still vibrant and the content still looks sharp, also this improves battery life since 4K tends to drain battery capacity quite quickly. Performance wise, this phone competes with the big names like Samsung, LG, HTC, OnePlus you name it. It's actually snappier than the S8 in certain situations therefore lagging is unheard of on this phone. Although I will admit, when I now got the phone, Facebook would crash without warning, however, after an update for the Facebook app, no such issues have happened since. Which simply means that Facebook was the source of the problem, not the phone's software/hardware. Overall, if you're a Xperia fan, you're gonna love this phone. If you're an Android fan, you're gonna love it, if you like being on the cutting edge of smartphone technology, you're gonna love it. Yes, it may not have the thinnest bezels, but the industrial design is classic, timeless and holds a certain level of appeal that you just can't get with any other manufacturer.",27,"Sony"

The camera takes excellent photos and wakes up fast for those fleeting moments you want to capture. The video quality and audio quality is excellent. Responsiveness is extremely well-received.The battery is long-lasting (My battery went from 75% to 42% in 4 hours from active gaming, watching movies, and playing music). I appreciate the bezels on top and bottom of the phone as it makes holding the unit very easy and reduces the chances of accidental dropping. Many reviewers say that this phone appears outdated (physically), but I believe that if something isn't broken, don't fix it. This phone does not get as much praise as it should because it does not endorse gimmicks provided by more marketed smartphones such as Samsung and Apple (dual lens cameras, infinity displays). There's a reason as to why Sony has lasted so long in this game. Try this phone out for yourself and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",14,"Sony"
"1709","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","This is an excellent smartphone, and my favorite. Deepsea Black and 4K screen are both gorgeous. Two front firing speakers, and aIl real headphone jack. Handles 2 SIMS if you need 'em or substitute the 2nd with a huge capacity micro-SD card. Cameras are really good, and fast, and steady-shot works very well. Android Oreo is very smooth and refined. The Snapdragon 835 is easy on the battery and blazingly fast. Bluetooth 5.0 pairs quickly and provides great sound with wireless headphones, and HD music through Sony's music app is pure bliss. The phone works in places I've never had a signal before such as my metal buildings or in dead zones in my regular travel routes - totally unexpected. I have it paired with an Asus Zenwatch 2 - they work very well together. Both can make it through my 16-18 hour days with over 30% battery remaining. I listen to podcasts, books, and watch TV shows, TED, movies, YouTube, and training courses on this. I really appreciate the 2 front firing speakers and the ability to plug in my headphones. This is great phone for consuming media. Its also water resistant. If there is one thing I'd ask for, it's a functioning fingerprint scanner - I'd miss it more, but the phone stays unlocked with my watch on my wrist, so it's not a big problem. Oh, and where's the FM Radio? In my opinion, this beats my HTC phones, my GS8, and the iPhones I've used.",7,"Sony"
"1710","B06Y2GX8K8",4,"true","Overall, I like this phone very much. First, the good: As soon as I turned it on for the first time, it was ready to update to Android 8.0 (Oreo) and it did so flawlessly. This is a big deal for me, as I hate waiting for new updates. The display is pretty good (not on par with Pixel or LG30, but it's $400 less) and the performance is very smooth and fast as you would expect from the 835 processor (currently the fastest available.) Others have suggested the styling is old-fashioned, but I like it, and find it sleek and modern looking; regardless, I'm more concerned with how a phone works than with how it looks. On the other hand, the camera--while much better than what you'd have gotten two years ago--is not the greatest. It's occasionally slow to focus and images have less than perfect color cast to them. It's not great in low light, but it's certainly a serviceable camera for most situations, especially if you use an app like Snapseed or Aviary to process the pictures before posting them. The design can be a drawback: This phone is very sleek, but also VERY slippery and hard to hold on to. I have already dropped this more times in a month than I've dropped all my other phones ever (it's pretty rugged, as it's still running well). If you set it on even a slightly sloped surface (like the arm of a chair), it's going to slide right off. I bought a ten dollar rubberized case which has fixed it, but now it's harder to slide in and out of a pocket. My only real complaint about this is that Sony has, for some reason, disabled adaptive storage on this, meaning the Micro USB Card (up to 256 G) can only be used for external storage, not mounted as a part of internal storage. I have a lot of apps on my phone and really appreciated my older phone's ability to add internal storage via the Micro card.",4,"Sony"
"1711","B06Y2GX8K8",4,"true","My phone is currently being repaired with Sony. My biggest decision is whether I keep buying Sony products is if they are able to fix it or give me a warranty replacement. It suddenly turned off while I was charging it and wouldn't turn back on. Pros: - Red color, and a sleek build with a large display - 4K DISPLAY - Camera quality is one of the best that I've used. And what's even better is that I'm able to view it in 4k, right after shooting it. No other phones can do that currently, besides the Z5 Premium. - Shutter button for the camera is super convenient. - Still has headphone jack. - Had expandable storage with two sim card trays. Cons: - SOUND VOLUME is sooo low. Hardly able to hear it most the times - The bevels are too big, but you get used to it. - Bluetooth is the worse... I didn't know what was wrong with it sometimes. It would cycle through and take almost a minute to connect to the one I wanted. Sony needs to fix this through a software update. - Camera is not very good in low light conditions - Fingerprint scanner does not work for US versions. You could jailbreak the phone, but it probably would void the warranty. Hoping my issue gets resolved so that I can keep my trust with Sony products.",NA,"Sony"

"1725","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","Pros -3.5 mm Jack -Old Design, very much welcomed -4k Screen (can be tampered a bit to be always 4k) This is the last Sony phone being released with a 3.5mm Jack, sadly they're going wireless or needing an adapter. This phone can handle 2 Sim Cards or 1 sim and 1 SD, depending on your situation. I like the boxy design it has, and it's the last phone I know that they are releasing with this design. Everything coming up has no jagged edges. The screen isn't always 4k, but you can use another program to fix that if that's what you desire (takes no more than a few minutes to do). The screen sticks to 1080p unless it's a video. At default settings the phone would last me a full work day, but now I'd say I lost an hour or two from it, being always 4k, that's not bad actually. Cons -FM Tuner Unavailable -Using outdoors is difficult during the day -Audio is clear, but not obnoxiously loud I'm hoping they update it to work using FM Tuner, I really enjoyed not having to have a separate device to listen to the radio. I don't always use the radio, but when I want to it's not there. There aren't any apps to replace it, unless you don't mind finding a radio on the web (using internet data). The screen sucks when in the sun. Difficult to use, it might be the brightness, but that doesn't bother me. The picture quality is very nice, I can live with it. When I'm outdoors I'm moving, so viewing my screen isn't that much of an issue to me. The speakers on the phone is clear, but if you're looking for loud... well... you might want to look elsewhere.",NA,"Sony"
"1726","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","I love this phone. The screen and performance is amazing, the battery lasts me from 730am to 930pm (I have 2 jobs), even with listening to my Bluetooth headphones for part of the day. The slow motion camera is very fun and the 4k recording will be awesome when I start making YouTube vids. I love that's its waterproof, one thing I don't have to worry about as a gardener.",NA,"Sony"
"1727","B06Y2GX8K8",4,"false","Day 1 - First impression: Wow! What a handsome phone. lol Feels good in my hand. Thought it'd be heavier. A little big though, but it didn't bother me too mucht. It's actually lighter than my iPhone 7 with Smart Battery case. I haven't had or used an android phone in over a year so it took a bit of time to adjust. A case and screen protector is a must. This phone is just too beautiful to risk scratching. (As you all know, this is definitely a finger print magnet naked) Protect your phone! Setting up and transferring all my contacts and music over to this phone from my iPhone was too easy and I was so happy to see that all my ALAC music was compatible. In fact I prefer the Music app built into this phone over the iOS apple music app. Love the album art search option built in the app too. I also purchased the Sony 1000x headphone and was very impressed with the LDAC quality bluetooth codec. I compared regular bluetooth from my MacBook vs this LDAC from the Sony phone with the headphones. The LDAC definitely wins here. Wow! What a treat to have HiFi wireless music to your headphones. Simply amazing! It's definitely my favorite feature so far. The screen resolution is impressive! Over 800ppi! Yowza! Overkill? Yeah, maybe! Watching youtube videos in 2160p is a sight to behold at such a high density of pixels. The black levels are about the same as any other lcd screen. Not as impressive as any oled/amoled phone, but not horrible. About average. It's the bright scenes in a video that shine here. Especially at higher resolutions. Day 2: I just transferred my SIM card over to this phone. I will confirm this phone works with AT&T. I haven't had any issues with the LTE connectivity. Although the signal strength logo in the notification bar had an ""H+"" logo next to it. I'm not sure what that was even though i still had a decent internet connection. I went to settings, clicked on ""..."" 'More' then 'Mobile Networks' then 'Preferred network type' and clicked on the 'LTE option.' the logo changes to LTE. Hope that helps. I'm not sure if i'm just used to the rediculous amount of battery life i got using the smart battery case with my iPhone 7, but this phone's battery drained pretty quickly today. I wasn't even half way through the day and it was at 27%. Though, I am a heavy user and am always listening to music while I search the web or watch youtube videos. But I lost 11% in standby mode over a course of 3-4 hours. Needless to say I was disappointed as I read the battery life was supposed to last all day. I can handle a few hiccups, but battery life is a big deal to me. I found myself missing my iPhone at the end of the day. Day 3: I had mixed feeling today, but had a positive outlook by the end of it. AM: I played with the phone and lost almost 50% of the battery within the first 4 hours. I put the SIM card back into my iPhone. Put this back on the charger and thought maybe I should sell it. PM: While in bed, I checked the settings to see what was going on. Turns out I didn't have ""Stamina mode"" turned on. There are 2 versions: Stamina Mode & Ultra Stamina mode. The latter seems like overkill unless you just want to use the basic phone features. (No wifi and mobile date) The basic Stamina mode has 3 levels: Device performance, Balanced Power, & Battery Time preferences. I chose 'battery time preferred' and it went from a predicted 8+ battery life to 15+ battery life. (whaaat!) So far i've noticed it has slowed down the drainage of battery. I see only slight performance issues through normal use. (Animations, slow scrolling, etc. on some apps) I'll keep it at this setting for now, but might op of the balanced option tomorrow. If this mode can deliver with the promised battery life (or close to it) with it on then I'll definitely keep the phone. I'll sleep with a sigh of relief tonight. :) Also, I paired this phone with a couple of Sony XB40 speakers synced together for stereo sound and, although you don't get LDAC quality on more than one speaker at a time. That was kind of a bummer. I still love the speakers though. I couldn't find any information about LDAC working on more than one speaker or headphone at a time online so thought i'd share my experience. DAY 4: Still loving this phone. Not much to say today. The battery life's better than yesterday. The 'Stamina' feature works pretty well as far as i can see. CHECK BACK FOR MORE UPDATES.",26,"Sony"

"1733","B06Y2GX8K8",2,"true","I switched to this phone after using a Sony Xperia Z5 compact for over a year and it isn't the upgrade I was hoping for. There are a lot of nice things about the phone but it isn't worth the price. Pros: Sound quality is good Phone looks nice in general Front and Back cameras take great photos 4k video recording works and looks great (looks better cast to a 4k tv than on the phone) Cons: My device has moments where the touch screen doesn't respond which makes typing extremely difficult. letters are skipped and games are interrupted. (working with support on this one) The screen isn't noticeably better than my z5 compact and 4k videos don't look spectacular on the screen at all. It is also difficult to find 4k streaming for mobile devices. The battery life is horrible. I will drop my brightness down to 35% and play words with friends for about 15 minutes and that alone drains roughly 12% of my battery. Dual sim is useless to me because the sim2 slot shares the sd card slot instead of allowing 2 sims and an sd card. I'm not a fan of SwiftKey keyboard and for some reason it comes as your default keyboard. I'm also not a fan of google sms and that is the default sms app. I find it strange that there is no fingerprint sensor. it gives the impression that the phone was not ready for release and was rushed on to the market. I find that my device lags a lot and has to be restarted more frequently than my z5 compact. When Stamina mode is on my touch screen is even less responsive than normal. I am working to get some issues resolved but it really isn't a jaw dropping phone either way. The 4k screen doesn't make up for the lack of other features and really doesn't stand out against other hd screens. The camera is very nice but not as nice as my older model xperia so that was a bust. I recommend buying a cheaper model sony xperia or wait for their next mobile device to debut.",NA,"Sony"

It's waterproof, so I can clean it, use it with wet hands, take rain photos... record water dripping onto the camera in slow motion. Google cardboard looks amazing, though it's hit or miss if the apps adhere to your viewer profile. Dual shock 4 works perfectly for gaming. I could do almost everything I would on a daily basis with the pre-installed apps. Check out Lifelog if you haven't, even if you have a different phone. Battery is lasting the whole day with moderate-heavy use. It keeps track of your charging habits and adjusts. Fingerprint sensor is disabled, but I'm not missing it.

Whether or not you like the design, there is one thing that is undeniable: this Glass Loop surface is unique to the XPERIA XZ Premium, couple that with the glass to aluminum design, and this is in my opinion, the most beautiful smartphone I have ever owned, and it certainly catches passerby's attention as I often get asked ""What kind of phone is that?""

"1747","B06Y2GX8K8",2,"true","I really wanted to love this phone, and despite the negative reviews I read I decided to give it a try anyway. The good: Outside aesthetics look gorgeous, performance is mostly quick, stereo and 4K display are nice. Those are about the only good things I have to say. It is overpriced for a phone riddled with bugs that just feels unfinished. Also, US version of phone has to be modified if you want the fingerprint scanner function. It freezes up at times and often requires system reboot, this was on android os 8.0. Certain things to note: The 4K is not always usable. For example on YouTube, if you are on a wifi connection and want 4K quality, the connection has to be fast enough to handle the 4K streaming. So you won't be using it everywhere. And the slow motion capture is kind of a ""gimmick"" like another reviewer put it. It was too grainy to use at times, and don't even mention night shots with this camera, it was not up to par. I like the Sony design language but the width combined with the thinness makes the phone feel too angular in the palm of my hand, and it can be painful. It also has more of a feminine look than masculine if that is important to you. The phone is not very practical, they could have given the camera button some programmability, like ability to add a flashlight shortcut, which the light itself was very poor for a phone this pricey. The phone was not very popular with case manufacturers and as a result there are not many options out there. For these reasons I decided to move onto something else, but I would reconsider this phone if the bugs were worked out and the price was much lower. To be fair, there are a few hacks and work around available for the finger print scanner and flashlight on XDA, but I just prefer having these things working correctly out of the box instead of tinkering with them. However, I still encourage you to give it a try if curious because you may definitely have a better experience than I, especially if you don't mind tinkering with your phone.",NA,"Sony"

"1754","B06Y2GX8K8",4,"false","This is going to be a sketchy review, because I'm still feeling my way into the capabilities of this phone. (See update below.) I currently have an iPhone 7 Plus which is maxed out with memory. I got this phone as an Amazon reviewer, and mainly because I was intrigued by the built-in camera features. I could see using this primarily as a photography tool with web browsing capabilities - and as a phone if I find it can get better cellular reception where I live. Here's some initial impressions. It's about the same length and width as an iPhone 7 Plus, and a little thicker. Unlike the iPhone, the corners are not rounded. There are no big buttons on the front - they're all on the sides or on screen. The look and feel is gorgeous; the sleek finish is very attractive - but you may find yourself becoming conscious of every smear of grease, dirt, and fingerprints on it. The screen size looks identical, but it has 2160 x 3840 pixels compared to 1080 x 1920 for the iPhone Plus. The aspect ratio is the same, but the Sony packs more pixels into the display. Does that matter? I'm guessing not, for watching funny cat videos. Watching movies, taking photographs - possibly. I'm going to have to compare to see if it really makes that much of a difference. Unlike the iPhone, you can swap out memory cards. You don't have to pay extra to max it out on memory if you're prepared to carry spare memory cards around. The thing about a phone like this and others of its class is that they're not primarily phones any more. The apps they run, the hardware extras like cameras and displays, the internet/media capabilities they can offer, their connection speeds - all of these are where the real battle takes place between competing models. That's not to say the phone part doesn't matter though. *** Before you shell out for an unlocked phone, check to see if your current phone company supports that model. Some networks limit your choices and you may have to choose a new service provider if you really want to use a particular phone.*** I hope to update this review as I spend more time exploring the capabilities of this phone. So far, it looks interesting - but time will tell. UPDATE: I finally got the phone set up with a phone company because I needed a second dedicated line. It's been interesting. As a longtime iPhone user, adjusting to Android has been a bit of a job. I'm finding the placement of the buttons on the side of the phone give me problems - I keep disconnecting when trying to take an incoming call for one thing. I've also had to spend the first 2-3 days repeatedly downloading updates for the Android operating system, a problem for me because the net access speeds I have at home over my wireless router aren't great, and the phone company signal strength isn't either. After one particularly big update failed to load, I went back to the phone store and sat there using their wireless to download it - and it still took forever. Along with all the system updates, apps keep updating too. It's been about a week now, and the torrent of updates has finally slowed. The phone still looks great, but I'm not terribly impressed with its functionality yet. I'll have to see how its media capabilities stack up - photo and video.",4,"Sony"
"1755","B06Y2GX8K8",4,"false","Camera and speed are amazing. Battery isn't as large as some but lasts better than most due to better battery management. Lasts longer than my s8.

Speaker sound quality is great, but they don't get loud enough. Wireless headphones work great though, like, really great. LDAC connection over Bluetooth works incredibly well, and I don't miss headphone jack and wires. Even though this phone has one. I may upgrade to the xz2 premium which has omitted the headphone jack. The battery life has held up well over the heavy usage over a year. The battery charge app will reduce the time the phone is over 90 percent in order to preserve the battery life. So far it works great. It's 8pm here and I have 37% left for the day. It was a relatively light usage day. Only about 3 to 4 hours screen on time so far. I recently cleaned out the phone by removing unused apps and old videos to free up space. And the phone seems to run smoother now that the memory isn't all used up. But trust me, this is the best phone I've ever had. Better than my wife's s8, and better than my s6 and s7. I purchased my phone at launch and paid over 700 usd. To get this phone new for only 500 ish is a steal. It's the fastest, most well rounded phone I've ever had, and that's including all the faults. Sure, a lot of people don't like the bezels, but you learn to appreciate them more when you don't accidentally hit the screen by accident all the time like the slim bezel phones. Maybe I'll go for the xz2 premium, but this phone has been so good, I may not need to upgrade this year. It's strange how nobody has this phone. When my friends ask, they're so jealous of this phones capabilities, yet Sony don't seem to get the attention they deserve. I'd say give em a shot. You may find a new favorite. I did.",NA,"Sony"

I can vouch that this phone is durable...just needs better software....I've dropped it and only had minor scratches on the gorilla glass. ..but when I threw it on the ground...it bent a bit and was still kicking..try can't stay on when I need to update lol...wanted to love the phone but it was more of an inconvenience now that I look back.",2,"Sony"
"1761","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"false","The XZ Premium is the first Sony-made smartphone that finally gets most of the important details right. The glass front and back covers a gorgeous gloss black case that feels great in the hand… it’s really smooth and there’s good grip. Which is critical on this phone because it’s BIG. Not really any bigger than other devices in the 5.5” screen arena, but still big. What really sets the XZ Premium apart from other devices is a few things: that 4k screen, the super-high speed video capture, and the lack of any biometric way to login to the device (which has turned out to be a device-killer for me). The screen is everything you’d imagine a 4k screen to be. Color reproduction is amazing and 4k content (I recommend “Landscapes” on YouTube for testing) looks better than real life. Likewise, switching over to Netflix and watching Stranger Things or House of Cards in 4k on a device that fits in your pocket is awesome. That said, 4k content is still a bit limited and streaming it eats up data like crazy… so to really enjoy the screen you’d want to ensure you’re on a relatively fast Wi-Fi connection. Netflix requires the purchase of their top streaming plan in order to get 4k HDR video, but it IS natively supported on the XZ Premium… once you add that plan to your account you can browse around and stream 4k content . Nice! You won’t use the 4k HDR features much… but when you do, you’ll really appreciate them. The high-speed camera can record slow motion video at 960 frames per second… which is insane. Some of the video you can capture with this is truly mind-blowing. The high-speed camera really needs good, strong light to capture anything (as you’d expect). Apart from high-speed capture, it has a 19MP Sony sensor and photos look good in both low and bright light. The place where the XZ Premium really falls down is in unlocking the device. For whatever reason the European model of this phone has a fingerprint reader built in to the power button on the side, but the US version does not. Man… I didn’t think it would be a big deal but after being able to unlock every device I’ve owned with my fingerprint for a couple years, entering a PIN to unlock feels like a step back in to the past. This is the ONLY feature that might cause me to suggest other devices instead of the Sony. I read that it has something to do with some patent issue, but whatever it is… Sony needs to get this figured out. I’ve heard that Sony might enable the fingerprint reader (apparently the reader is in the phone, but turned off in the firmware) later this year. Here’s hoping it happens! The rest of the phone is awesome… button feel is excellent, battery life is good and easily makes it through 1-1.5 days with moderate use, the remote play feature (if you own a PS4) is awesome and works really well, speakers are ok, and the SnapDragon processor is really fast… so the UI and apps run well. As a guy that floats between iPhone and Androids, the Sony is my current top pick for an Android phone (even vs. the Pixel 2) really due to this 4k screen and high-speed camera. Sony got SO much right with this phone… if the disabled fingerprint reader doesn’t bother you, this phone will not disappoint you.",9,"Sony"

High Dynamic Range photography, 4K Video, 1080p 60fps, 720p 960fps super slow motion, 19MP 4:3 stills, or 17MP 16:9 stills.

"1764","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"true","Fantastic smartphone by Sony, I love it so far. (I bought the Deepsea Black version. ) I also tried the HTC U11 for a few days last week, but I returned it. I definitely like the XZ Premium better. Surprisingly, the audio performance in particular made the biggest difference for me between these two flagships. The ""acoustic chamber"" of the HTC U11 makes the highs in audio playback sound distant, but on the XZ Premium they are crystal clear. (Lows do sound slightly better on the U11.) I played ""The Ecstasy Of Gold"" on both, and the mids and highs were much better on the Sony. Also, I appreciate that Sony still includes a stock email client with the built-in ability to reduce photo attachment sizes. That may sound insignificant, but for me it's pretty important. Only Samsung and LG seem to still do so as well, so good on ya, Sony. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, signal reception is top notch with this phone, you won't be disappointed. I work in a weak cell reception area, but the XZ Premium performs like a champ there. I also love Sony's Album (gallery app) which you can theme dark, and it allows you to pinch the gallery in and out as you scan through photos and videos. Again, this may be insignificant to some, but for me it is very important. The total price for the XZ Premium is a bit steep; I think that it should've been around $700.00 instead of $800.00, but I still believe that it will be worth it in the long run.

"1781","B06Y2GX8K8",5,"false","Overall I really like this phone. Since the focus of this phone is the camera I will concentrate my comments on those features. Photo quality is as good or better than competitors’ options (iPhone, Galaxy, etc.). Controls are simple to use; however, the large size of the phone can make it difficult to operate the camera one-handed. Sony’s Intelligent Auto mode works very well and takes most of the thinking out of your hands. I don’t have anything to back this up, but it seemed to accommodate for lighting situations better than other phone cameras. In manual mode, you can adjust focus, exposure, white balance, and shutter speed, which offers more creative control over your photos. The autofocus does a great job tracking moving targets. HDR function is not as easy to turn on and off as it is on other cameras. Instead of having an option right on the screen, you have to enter the camera menu to access HDR controls. This is only an issue if you don’t always use that function. I would choose to leave it on all the time, as it tends to result in better photos most of the time. As in all other phones, the selfie/back camera is not as good as the main camera, but the image quality is still pretty good, and it’s a wider-angle lens than a lot of competitor selfie cameras. One potential show-stopper for the avid photographer is the lack of a RAW format capability, which significantly limits what you can do in post-production with the files. The Apple and Samsung are starting to offer a RAW option, and there are plenty of 3rd party apps that shoot in RAW for those platforms, but I’m not aware of any for the Sony as of yet. At 960fps the super slow-motion capability is a huge leap forward for any camera, not just a smart phone camera, but it is limited and seems a little gimmicky at this point. Shooting at 960fps only lasts for a few seconds and timing the slow-motion capture is very difficult. It takes a lot of trial and error to figure it out, and even then it’s still hard to capture the moment. The slow-motion camera also needs a ton of light to maintain quality video. Quality of the slow-motion in low-light situations is significantly degraded. There’s also no regular speed video at the beginning and end of the shot, as in most other smart phone slow-motion features. Overall, the camera is a really nice feature and gives you more creative control over your photos than in other leading smart phone cameras. That being said, it’s not THAT much of a difference from the competitors, and the slow-motion feature is more impressive on paper than in practice. I wouldn’t recommend getting this phone just for the camera. The 4K screen resolution is amazing and a noticeable step up from other smartphones for watching videos and movies. As a phone, call quality is very good. I use the speakerphone often and again, quality and sound are good for calls and streaming music. The device is well crafted and feels far more sturdy in my hand than my iPhone. And the finishes are sleek and elegant. So even though I wouldn't recommend buying this for the camera features alone, overall it is an excellent device.",3,"Sony"

UI constantly locks up, apps will randomly crash, it'll suddenly go crazy, on its own, and start draining the battery, with nothing running. On top of that, the phone gets easily bogged down if you try to do more than one thing at a time. Certain features that should be great, like the battery saver, give you no options to set optimal charge time. It's supposed to learn based on your habits, except if you change for a single day (go to bed earlier or later, or wake up later) it throws the entire schedule off, so instead of completing the charge at the regular time, it's now picked some arbitrary time unrelated to anything you've done.

"1803","B071JP8XDJ",4,"true","Still have the new car smell so can't leave to much of an impression yet. First, the phone is gorgeous. Much sexier than my old XA Ultra. I grew very fond of the Xperia XA Ultra large screen and 21mp camera that when it started to die after almost 3 years of hard use, I looked into another Xperia Ultra. The previous phone I had survived many, many drops, scratches, dents, and moments in the rain and snow with no case or screen protector, that I felt confident moving into the newer version. Though, I will be getting a screen protector and case this time round. I know that I'll have limited options since the phone is not very popular. Initial impressions are that the XA1 Ultra feels a tad faster than my previous phone and really appreciate the extra 16gb of internal storage. Anything less tham 32gb these days is a chore in storage management. It took nearly all night to run through the series of updates that Sony had queued up to land on a pretty solid build of Android 8.0. UI feels nearly identical to my previous phone, which is pleasant as I don't have to hunt for too many things and felt right at home in customizing my phone. The 23mp camera is great. I see a lot of reviews slamming the quality of the photos taken, but I am very pleased. HDR does appear to blur the sharpness slightly, but not enough to not appreciate the excellent quality for such a reasonable price. Colors can be corrected and should be if you are looking for the best quality. Video...disappointed that I can't shoot 4K like my previous XA Ultra could. That's why I dropped the rating from 5 stars to 4. After more time with the phone, I will update my review.

I have ample enough room for the apps I use with the 32 GB storage. I was pleased that the phone upgraded to the latest Android OS soon after I got it. The bad...this phone operates much warmer than I think it should, and I think whatever makes it operate so warm is the culprit that sucks the battery down way too fast. It has the shortest battery life of any phone I've ever owned. In fact, it's so bad I was inspired to buy a small battery pack to carry around in case I need it. When the phone is not running hot the battery doesn't drain nearly as fast. Also, I wish the speaker was on the front facing me instead of on the bottom. I bought some small headphones so I could hear my music better, but the volume in the headphones is way too low. I love the big screen display which makes watching Direct TV more enjoyable. However, the screen is hard to see in bright daylight. That makes it hard to operate the camera in the sunlight. I still give the phone a solid 4 stars.

The rear camera takes great photos (although the colors of photos look a little too intense by default, but that can be changed), and the front camera's front flash is a nice touch to the also-amazing 13mp front camera. The inclusion of a notification LED was a must for me, and although it's a little hard to differentiate the ""white"" from ""yellow"" LED indicating notifications for different apps, it's still a great feature to have. Sound quality is great, however I would have liked for the speaker to be front facing instead of downward firing. FM radio was a major selling point for me with so few phones supporting it in the USA, and the inclusion of it on this phone is one of my favorite features. There's not fingerprint reader, which is a let down coming from a phone that did have one, but entering in a quick PIN to unlock the phone isn't too much of a deal-breaker for me.

"1826","B071JP8XDJ",5,"true","I'll start off by saying this is the biggest phone I've ever owned, so it is taking a bit of adjustment for me to hold with one hand (I have pretty big hands,) to hold sideways and use the keyboard (even though I'm doing that right now for this review and the predictions and auto correct are pretty spot on,) and it feels noticeably bulkier in my pocket. All those things aside considering I knew I was buying a large phone... I love this thing. It's remarkable. It feels like there's no delay when I open games on my phone. Games like Pokémon Go, Brave Soul, Crusaders of Light, etc. all open on this phone quickly and look absolutely stunning. Not to mention the giant screen makes things easier to see. Double SIM slot, yeah. I threw in an old 64gb micro SD card along with my nano SIM and was immediately using this phone without any hiccups. All four buttons are on the right side of the phone - volume up/down, power (which is lock and unlock button, as per usual,) and the camera button. Though spaced apart perfectly enough where they're not in the way of each other, I kinda wish the power button was on top of the phone. That's just a preference of habit, though! The speaker is on the bottom of the phone alongside the charger port. Takes the C charger, which is gonna be the future universal charger in my opinion (kinda like going from cassette tape to CD,) due to the faster data and electrical transfer speeds. How's the speaker? I'd truthfully say mediocre. It's also in a spot that can easily and accidentally be covered by your index finger when holding the phone horizontal. That or maybe I just hold my phone weird. I consider the camera pretty stunning myself, but I'm also moving up from a phone that had half the MP on both cameras compared to this one. I don't see a single grain in new photos off this phone. Finally, the part I love most. This phone doesn't strong arm you into using the pre installed ""bloatware"" like other phones typically do. You don't wanna use the default music and photo apps? Don't give them permission. This phone asks you permission for pretty much every app that comes pre installed. When you say no, it's not a clingy girlfriend. It leaves you alone permanently until you attempt to use the app again. It may seem overwhelming when first setting up the phone (essentially, imagine a ""Do you wish to allow...?"" every 30 seconds for maybe 5-10 minutes,) but after that it's smooth sailing. And that minor and short-lived annoyance is a tiny price to pay in my opinion for Sony being nice enough to ask for my consent before bloatware assaulting my phone. Tl;Dr My rating speaks for itself. 5/5 stars. For the tech in this phone, the size, the midrange price... I'd highly recommend if you have a thing for large phones, but don't want one of the phones that are tablet sized.",106,"Sony"

"1832","B071JP8XDJ",4,"false","This is a lengthy review, a phone as sophisticated and noteworthy as this one deserves full attention to details. Because it is a new product of course complete testing will take additional time, this review will be updated as needed. I have always liked Sony products, especially their TV's and cameras. I don't think there's a room in my house without at least one Sony product. However I've only been able to admire their smartphones from afar, they generally are priced way out of my range. The XA1 series however, brings a lot of Sony niceness down to a more budget-friendly realm. This series has two phones, a 5"" model and this, the newer Ultra 6"" model. HOW BIG IS IT? Let's let the cat out of the bag right now ... this phone is huge, almost bordering on tablet territory. In fact its screen size is spec’d at exactly the same 6” size as a Kindle but in a device that’s a fraction of the size. This is NOT one of Sony's ultra-premium models and other than the better-than-average build quality (typically Sony) the overall performance is good, but not fantastic. Other phones offer higher resolution displays, not that this one looks bad; it's just not the best out there. Sound quality (something I would hope Sony would excel at) is better than some but not as good as the best, and surprisingly there are no stereo speakers. THE CAMERA And the camera? The one thing you absolutely expect Sony to be best-of-class at? Let me be clear that I am a pro photographer with a critical eye and I have a great deal of respect for Sony cameras. Despite mind-blowing specs on paper, the XA1's camera quality failed to make me go WOW. They brag about how quickly you can go from off to picture-taking mode (1.1 seconds) but once you actually press the button the camera is comparatively slow to complete the task, and sometimes misses the ideal setting completely. The results are not as good as I expected, and in low light they sometimes disappointed me. The selfie cam on the other hand is impressive ... wider angle than most to cram more friends in the frame, a real front flash that actually works and a cool shutter release that's activated by waving your hand (that only gets tricked once in a while). The full-face screen that goes almost to the very edge is sure to impress the Joneses, but the weird little gap with a tiny black border gives away the fact that this isn't Sony's best effort. The phone is chock-full of features and gimmicks, too many to list here. It ships with Android 7.0 Nougat and Sony' better than average overlay. Response (as you would expect) is lightning quick. Despite being huge in your hand it's not slippery and the beveled edges feel better than you would expect. The control buttons feel, um, very iPhone-like. That's a compliment. Get ready, though, to buy some new cables because this phone ditches the more common micro USB in favor of the incompatible USB-C. At least it still has a headphone jack! EXPLAINING THE SAMPLE PHOTOS A side-note about the size comparison and camera quality photos with this review. Why compare it to an iPhone? I assure you I understand that this phone and the iPhone are very different devices and my comparison is in no way intended to suggest one is better than the other. The IPhone 6s was used because it is the only other smartphone in our household and it was handy. The 6s is almost identical in size to the iPhone 7 and together the two of them represent a large percentage of phones people own, so I thought a size comparison might be useful to some people. As far as the photo sample comparison, as a professional photographer who has written books and taught classes on the subject I have said countless times that more megapixels does not mean better picture quality, there are so many other factors involved in a camera’s ability to take high-quality pictures. The samples I used weren't staged in any special way, just a spontaneous random snapshot taken at the same time from the same spot of a wall-hanging in our living room under low lighting conditions (the light of a 40 watt bulb). The settings on the two phones were whatever the camera defaulted to (and granted with user adjustment settings both photos could be enhanced). No flash was used because I wanted to see how they would do under a challenging low light condition. Finally, be aware that both photos were cropped identically to exactly 10% of the full frame, so you are seeing an extreme example of “digital zoom”. The samples you see are the result, you can draw your own conclusions. That being said, my random snapshot comparison was not counted by me in rating this phone, I plan to post some additional sample photos later. But I want to make it clear that the Sony's camera is extremely good and I've already taken some very nice photos with it. If anything the comparison only points out that (like most cameras with tiny sensors) this one is not perfect, especially under low light in which it seems to crank up the gain way too much. NON-POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS I was surprised and disappointed at the battery life, it’s not only bad it’s really bad. I could almost watch the battery-level meter ticking downward toward zero. I’ll offset that by saying that Sony packs numerous of their apps into the phone and with any new phone it takes a little time to customize how the device is set up. But even after deleting some apps and changing the settings battery life is still pretty bad. On one hand that is to be expected from a phone with a huge hi-res screen, I’ll see how it is after a few weeks of use. Another little quirk that has been an annoyance is that dedicated camera shutter release button. In concept I love the idea but it seems super sensitive to the point that I can hardly hold the phone in my hand without accidentally taking a picture. But, I don’t want to disable the feature either. It seems maybe Sony should have used a stronger spring in that button that would require a more firm push to activate. INITIAL SUMMARY Is this the best phone out there? No. Does it represent Sony's best effort? No. All things considered (including price) is it worth considering? A qualified yes on that one ... after using it I would rate it as one of a handful of phablets worth considering if you're into a lot of video playback and don't want to break the bank (although the lack of stereo speakers on a multimedia-aimed phone is a disappointment). As a camera phone when you want to leave the real camera home it should please most people most of the time (but there are definitely better camera phones out there). And used as strictly a cell phone for talking and texting it’s probably a lot of overkill but it's hard to imagine anyone being disappointed. But … remember this is not supposed to be Sony’s top of the line phone. When you consider what this phone sells for and how much value you get for the price, it is still very much one that should be on your short list of super-size smartphones to consider. As this phone is used more I will try to update this review as needed and of course answer any specific questions if I can.",165,"Sony"

"1846","B071JP8XDJ",3,"true","Updated from 4 to 5 Stars. Such an amazing cell phone and I simply love the camera. I plan to purchase another one as soon as I sell my prized CAT S60 cell phone. I bought this almost entirely for the camera in this phone and secondarily for its 6-inch display size and then the reasonably fast computational speed. So I'm going to review the camera primarily. The Android operating system and the apps work just like they would on any other phone. It has a big 6-inch display and if you leave it on the bright setting and use it all day, you're going to drain the battery fairly quickly. Even if you are being conservative, you will need to charge this phone daily or even multiple times a day or have an umbilical cord to a USB charger on it constantly. This phone comes with a standard USB to USB-C cable. It is not the fast charger cable. You need a double ended USB Cable and a high power source to do fast charging. I'm still selecting a high power AC wall charger with USB-C fast charger. I listed the one I'm about to purchase down below, but understand I haven't used it yet. I have used all the other accessories. The cell phone is lightweight and that means it has a lightweight battery which doesn't have sufficient power for a big 6-inch display and reasonably fast computer in it. If I were in charge of the battery decision, I would have insisted upon a much bigger battery in it and not even worry about how thick it was or what it weighed. It is a negative user experience to have to charge the battery so often just because some marketing guy wrote an unrealistic specification that the phone had to be thin and not weigh much at all. That's an artificial requirement that does not match the phone's functionality. Otherwise, it's a great phone. I wish and hope they come out with a thicker phone that's all battery inside so I don't have to purchase some giant auxiliary battery and double ended USB-C cable with fast charge rate to connect them. I'll show you the realistic setup to be mobile in a photo taken by another camera. It wouldn't have been necessary if they had put a decent sized battery inside this phone. This is the reason for a missing star and I was tempted to take off two stars, to be honest. Furthermore, they brag about how fast you can charge up the battery, but the AC wall charger that comes with this phone is inferior even to an ordinary AC USB charger. A normal USB charger produces 2.4 Amperes and this wall charger only produces 1.5 Amperes at 5 Volts. And it only has an ordinary USB receptacle - not a USB-C receptacle that doesn't matter which way you plug in the cable. So they included an adapter cable with an ordinary USB plug on one end and a USB-C plug on the other end. Now that's being really stingy considering I paid $400 for this phone. Then in the manual, they say to only use a Sony charger. If I do that, it will take next to forever to charge it. So now I need to buy a wall charger that meets the USB-C charging specification. So I had to purchase a separate USB-C to USB-C charging/data cable to use the fast charging port on the auxiliary battery I had to purchase because the internal battery is so lacking in power. I'm not in the least happy with the battery and the near worthless cheap charger they included. It's not even that useful for charging other electronics that always prefer 2.4 Ampere charging current. The camera is what offsets this cell phone from being a 3-star phone. But even the camera has a major shortcoming. Its flash is not a real flash. It's just a flashlight that's turned on momentarily to add additional light to the subject being photographed. To be a real flash, the flash speed should have been much higher intensity and faster than one-fifteen-thousandth (1/15,000) of a second and preferably one-fifty-thousandth (1/50,000) of a second to prevent blurred images of moving objects including people's faces and arms in group photos. There is a shutter speed option of 1/4000th of a second and an ISO speed of 3200. So the ISO speed is the light sensitivity number and is quite good. The shutter speed is also good. But the combination is still not good enough to prevent blurring. Otherwise, in a group photo, you've got to tell everybody to freeze their expression and absolutely don't move until I tell you that I'm finished with the photo. Useful tested accessories I have purchased and used are below (other colors are available for the protector case): Vinsic 20000mAh Power Bank, Ultra Slim External Battery Pack Backup Portable Charger with Quick Charger, Type C, Smart USB Outputs for All Smartphones (This 20,000 mAH battery is a near necessity. You can get smaller ones for emergencies, but you truly need this power for everyday use if you are frequently on the run and use your phone a lot. Yes, it is big and heavy.) I am about to purchase this wall charger. It has a good price, has good reviews and good charging rate. I will update this review after I receive it and get some actual experience with it. It seems versatile with other charging ports. Poweradd Quick Charge 3.0 USB Wall Charger with USB C Output, Foldable Plug for iPhone X / 8 / 8 Plus, iPad, Galaxy S8 / S7, Note 5 / 4, LG, Nexus, HTC and More AmazonBasics USB Type-C to USB Type-C 2.0 Cable - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) - White Dmax Armor- Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra [Tempered Glass] Screen Protector, (Full Screen Coverage) With Lifetime Replacement Warranty (Black) (Works with the cover below without any interference and that is important.) Xperia XA1 Ultra Covers, Terrapin Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra Case - TPU Gel - Slim Design - Durable Shock Absorbing - Back Protector - Solid Millennial Pink Matte Finish (Does not interfere with the custom form fitted glass screen protector above.) I went to a class reunion this weekend and the optical image-stabilization worked perfectly - absolutely no complaint about that. This is a feature where the optics shift in accordance with your hands' movement while taking a photo. So if you have jittery hands or you can't hold a camera very steady, it will compensate for that. Since I had to be in the group photo, my wife took the pictures. The wall background was always perfect - no movement from the camera. But people would turn their heads or shift over to get their face in the photo and at least one person would blur their face every time. That photo session was all done in the Auto Mode. Now if we had the phone long enough before this reunion, we could have had time to learn about all the camera adjustments in the Manual Mode. But Hurricane Harvey dumped a lot of water on us and mail service was shut down for a full week. Then it got hung up in Amazon's Fulfillment Center and I had to cancel the order and start over. I got the phone one day before departure for the reunion and it was a six-hour drive. All the photos got taken in Auto Mode. So first thing you do if you understand camera optics to a reasonable degree, go into the Manual Mode and set it up for the more demanding shots. You can switch back and forth between Auto and Manual easily. I think Sony could have readily installed a real flash on this camera instead of what amounts to an ordinary flashlight. It has red-eye pulsing to get your iris closed to reduce red-eye. I didn't have any red eyes in any photo, but I'm not sure I really tested it thoroughly. Indoor photography is phenomenal in static photos where nobody is moving very fast. Light sensitivity is just wonderful. Photo quality is simply outstanding. Now here is an important note on the number of megapixels. The only way to get 23 megapixels is in 4:3 format – somewhat of a square image. Always use this mode. Later you can crop it into widescreen 16:9 format or any other common photo format and even custom crop the image. If you always shoot in the 4:3 mode, it leaves you a lot of discretionary cropping that is otherwise taken away from you. Afterwards, you can shift the cropping up or down or side to side to optimize the composition of each photo. If you set the camera to 16:9, it's just going to take a photo right down the middle of the image sensor and simply chop off what is above and below the image on the camera sensor. It will definitely be a “what you see is what you get image”, but you just threw away a good percentage of your photo that you can never get back. Other than using up a little less memory on your auxiliary memory card, you just threw away the upper and lower part of the image sensor’s data. But the advantage of shooting in a particular format is you will not need to do any cropping later. You already cropped it when you took the photo. However, if you used the 4:3 mode, you have a lot of editing options when you do your post-production work on Photoshop Elements or even the photo editor in Windows 10 that is in many ways quite superior to Photoshop Elements. Cropping is so much easier in the Windows 10 photo tool. And the lighting and color optimization are also rather good and much faster and better than Photoshop Elements. I have the latest Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements 15, too. I’ve used it for decades. If this camera had optical zoom, I'd sell my Canon D5 Mark II and all my lenses immediately. This camera is equivalent to a wide angle 24 mm lens in the old 35 mm world. It's great for indoors shots and when you travel internationally; it's great outdoors taking photos of huge buildings and you don't have much space to back up to get the entire photo in the picture. Worst case, you can use stitching software to join the upper and lower halves of photos together. I've stitched as many as six photos together so seamlessly (3 across and 2 vertically) and it is mostly automated with a little help from you. You'd have to see the individual images separately to see where the boundaries are. It's that good. It's like a super wide angle lens in a software application.",55,"Sony"

"1897","B071JP8XDJ",5,"false","Edit: 09-21-17: I changed my mind. I love the phone. I still don't like that the mute isn't easy to use or that I can't buy an Otterbox, or that the TMZ app acts stupid, but I really love the phone. I have been using this phone for about two weeks and I'm going to give my opinion of it as a non-tech person. I'm not a soccer mom, I am a band mom to a trumpet player. First, the phone is large or as my go-to young person ( 21-YO son) calls it a fablet. It's what young people call large phones now-a-days. It is large for my hand, but smaller and easier to hold than my Blackberry Passport 10 (that is already obsolete after three years). I don't like the power switch on the right side since I'm left-handed. My thumb goes right over that spot and I have a habit of turning it off when I'm in the middle of something. The touch screen is nice and I had to get used to the lack of border; picture goes all the way to the edge. The touch screen is very sensitive. The OS is Android and my son was impressed that it was nugget...or something sweet and chewy. He began to explain it to me. I didn't care and tuned out after he told me it was fast. The apps come from google playstore. I like that because my BB Passport only had Blackberry and Amazon. There are tons of apps missing from those two including Facebook (yes, I'm serious). This app store is competing with Apple and not lagging behind. I even have more apps in this playstore than I do on my Nook Galaxy tablet which is also Google. The camera is very clear and shows wrinkles I didn't know were there. Bad camera! I have been taking selfies with my contacts for the address book. BTW, I still have not been able to transfer my address book. I am going to try again. In a way, it's a good thing. There are too many old numbers in it. And before you make fun of my Blackberry, it had no problems syncing with my Honda CRV three years ago. The Sony will not sync with my CRV which I really needed it to do on my long trip this past weekend as I had to take my young person back to college. Bad Bluetooth. The Bluetooth did work with my Jawbone Up band and that app loaded and is working correctly. The phone is okay. I think my problem is more with T-Mobile than with Sony. I went on YouTube and the sound quality is great along with the picture. The first time I used the camera, it was jumping all over the place. My techie at work, who was helping me with set-up, told me that the camera was ""smart"" and had to get used to me. The picture came out weird, but after that, it ""knew me"" and the rest of the pictures were fine. Like I said, the app store is full. I play a lot of Storm8 story games and I like that they don't crash like on my iPod or Nook. My iPod is also obsolete, but it still plays my tunes when the office gets loud. There is a lot of space on the Sony with 32GB. I was having problems with my Kindle and Nook because my apps were taking up too much space. Like my Blackberry, the Sony has ample space for several more apps. That's all I really have to say about it. I like it and its operating system. Except for the CRV Bluetooth issue, it has pretty much replaced my three other devices I used to carry to work. I don't have to worry about breaking my Galaxy Nook taking it to work to play my games, because I hate my job and internet games are what gets me through the day. One more thing, there was no adapter, just a cord. I thought that was pretty cheap of Sony since the phone costs $400 bucks.",12,"Sony"

"1899","B071JP8XDJ",1,"false","I want to start off by saying I don't write reviews. So the fact that I'm taking the time to write a review speaks for itself. I love Sony products, I have every single PlayStation console and they all still work! My original fat PS2 works without a hitch! I loved the PSP, the Vita and as a musician, I've always felt they made the best headphones for studio recordings. So when I was in the market for a new phone and heard that Sony was making smartphones, I was on board. When I compared the specs on this phone to other phones on the market I was very impressed especially for the price. It comes unlocked so that's a plus as well. I bought the phone. I don't know if I got a bad batch or what but this phone has a mind of it's own. If I don't restart it once a day it will freak out. It behaves as if the screen is being manipulated when it's not. It will open apps, settings, make or end phone calls. On one occasion I was using it to buy something on Amazon and it added about a dozen of a single item and confirmed the order before I could do anything to stop it. Luckily Amazon has amazing customer service and took care of it once I contacted them on my laptop. Everytime I take it off the charger and/or mount in the car, the camera starts by itself. I could go on and on about all the performance errors. In the beginning when I figured out that restarting it helped I was content to restart it daily, even though it takes forever to boot, however it now still freaks out even after restarting. I truly regret buying this phone, and I regret not taking it back when it started acting up because I loved Sony so much that I was blinded by loyalty to a company that was endeared to me from childhood. I wish I had taken it back and I wish I had bought a different phone. Stay away, this is high dollar crap. Sorry Sony, you let me down.",8,"Sony"

When I play games I've never had an issue like with other phones, where it freezes and such. This phone was really made to handle a lot. The only downfall so far has been the WiFi. When at home it will all of the sudden loose signal and/or give an authentication problem. I've discovered it really just has to fix itself. Sometimes that could be a couple minutes or an hour to a full day. I've been able to disconnect and retype in the password or restart my phone to fix it but can't count of it. This issue doesn't happen often, maybe once or twice a month. The camera isn't as great as I had expected, not being a professional, I love taking photos and it is good enough to get the job done and still look nice.

"1915","B071JP8XDJ",2,"true","Overall - I must say that I like the phone. It has done everything I bought it for well. BUT, here is why I have decided to write a review and to take three stars off the rating. I have been having issues with telemarketer/scammers calling my phone with bogus caller ID phone numbers. Many of them are disconnected numbers - but the more annoying ones are listing a local valid phone number - that is actually owned by actual local people or businesses – so you cannot block them without blocking people/businesses that are legit. So, I called AT&T about anything they could do and they told me to install AT&T Mobile Security and Call Protect – that this would help block these calls. I installed the AT&T Mobile Security App (which is maybe already bundled with Call Protect – not sure – odd wording). But I got an error during the install saying “Not Eligible – Your device must be enabled with AT&T HD-Voice to use this service”. So, I spent a while looking around on the internet and basically found that HD-Voice and Voice Over LTE is the same thing. It allows the voice portion of the call to go over LTE and data to still be usable while the voice call is in progress. I assume this is needed so their app can be receiving the call and checking against their app database system simultaneously to decide whether to allow or reject the call. I found YouTube videos of people with other brands of phones running Android that were able to go into Settings and enable the feature. But I couldn’t find the setting in my phone – different menu structure from the videos. I contacted Sony to see where they located this setting on their phone. To make the story short – two of their “support” reps confirmed that this phone (based on model and IMEI) supports HD-Voice. They then proceeded to give me instructions for how to configure the phone for some headset that I don’t have, nor do I have any headset, and that was their “solution” to my problem!?! I re-explained and told them that this is also known as Voice Over LTE (VOLTE) and that seemed to turn on a lightbulb in one of the rep’s head. At this point I was not confident at all that either of them had a clue about what I was actually talking about – but what else could I tell them! I explained all the steps I took – the apps involved, the exact error message!?! It was quite apparent that they had no idea what I was talking about and/or didn’t clearly read the issue and/or were simply setting there searching a support database with no inherent knowledge of this issue. In both cases I asked for a supervisor or more senior support tech – and in both cases they said no one else was available and they were it!!! Really Sony – you’ve got one rep for the USA and one for the UK and neither of them answer to anyone!?!?!?! At this point they both settled on that it was AT&T that would have to turn on the feature and for me to contact AT&T to resolve the issue!!! I re-iterated that I had seen videos of others that were able to turn the feature on/off from the Settings menu on their non-Sony phones and I didn’t understand why only AT&T could turn this feature on/off. By this time, they were talking in circles: It’s AT&T’s fault – call them!!! Back on the phone with AT&T!! Their Advanced Support – twice says – they phone is not HD-Voice capable and that they cannot provision it!?!?! Oh, and maybe I should just do a “free” upgrade and get a new phone. So – which is it? AT&T is pointing the finger at Sony (while trying to sell me a new phone contract) and Sony is pointing the finger at AT&T – probably (in my opinion) just to get me off their support line as they had no clue and wouldn’t spend any more time on the issue. In the end – no solution. I can’t install and run the Apps and most importantly to me at this point – I have no faith in Sony to provide any support on their phones. Yes – I lean towards Sony’s techs being wrong here as they were so oblivious and irrational throughout.",1,"Sony"
"1916","B071JP8XDJ",3,"true","I love Sony products and I was really excited to find this phone, but I'm afraid they let me down on this one. The cell service stayed either terrible or non-existent. I had to walk outside my house and hold the phone in the air just to get two bars, meanwhile my Moto X Pure and old Galaxy S4 are both showing four bars in the exact same location (we have a tower nearby as well). I used to have a Sony M4 Aqua, and cell service wasn't always the best with it, but it was enough to get by and I loved the phone. Read something about Sony phones not co-operating with US cell towers that well, but I don't know if that is true. May work great in bigger cities. I live near the southern tip of Ohio and it was giving me a lot of trouble. As far as the phone itself, it was BEAUTIFUL. The screen was awesome and the best part for me. The Gold was so pretty it would give a leprechaun a heart attack. The photos looked phenomenal. It was super fast and responsive and the phone's layout and functions differed little from other Sony phones, but I actually love that. Unfortunately, the cell service was just too bad and I had to return it.",2,"Sony"
"1917","B071JP8XDJ",3,"true","As soon as you leave the range of your WiFi router and it looses signal that's it. It will not reconnect to your WiFi again when you get back in range and in fact will tell you that there are ""No networks available"". So you have to restart the phone in order to get it to connect to the WiFi again. It took me far too long to figure this out; I was just wondering how my mobile data was being used up so quickly. Oh, because it literally never connects to the WiFi unless I restart completely. Great. Also, it seems to be a lot more fragile than phones I've had in the past. Still not the worst phone I've ever owned but definitely frustrating. Update, the WiFi problems get worse as time goes on. Sometimes the phone will just shut off WiFi for literally no reason and refuse to reconnect until you restart. I have never restarted another phone as often as this one. There is something fundamentally wrong with the WiFi antenna in this phone.",1,"Sony"

I am giving it 5 stars this time The battery did not decrease in performance, it hold power well and charge fast as it was 12 months ago. I was hoping it work with super charger but you can only use a super charger 3.0 that also support MTK Pump Express plus(PE2.0) technology or it will not works, sadly this phone comes with regular charger and cable, I found on Amazon the charger that can support super charge 3.0 with PE2. 0 and also USB-C cable that support fast charge and waiting for it to arrive, great phone for $280 no complains also it will be soon updated with Android 8.0 oreo according to Sony support website.",1,"Sony"

Now it just can't seem to locate wifi networks and in the rare case it does it will not stay connected. The GPS is crap always has me on the wrong street if I'm on the freeway it shows me as on the frontage road ect. It's preloaded with of corse a bunch of crap that I don't want or need and you are not able to unistall the apps so for instance Facebook which I do not use because they sell your data to third parties is always running even know I do not have an account so in a draconian way Sony is allowing a third part app to still collect data on me. The phone is so laggy its utterly ridiculous my Z3 runs much better than this phone its insane. This phone supposedly has more ram an double the memory tho, it must be cheap hardware. Sony makes all the cameras for their competitors but for some reason just can't seem to get it righ in their own phone which just doesn't make sense. It's either a lighting issue or movement that coupled with a really laggy shutter speed will drive you freaking nuts. So many times I just completely miss the photo opportunity due to the issues mentioned above and when I do get a shot it's just not good. The video is even worse, the z2 can do 4k and or 1080p at 60fps this is like video capturing from 2010. The X1 takes better pictures and definitely way better selfies. They toned this phone down so much from the Xperia series like no screen record ect but yet this phone runs like crap.

"1962","B071JP8XDJ",5,"true","This phone is AMAZING. I enjoyed various features of this phone. For being the largest phone I've ever owned it, I wasn't bothered by its size. I gave this phone a try to test out a large phone for the first time. I was amazed by the features of the phone. No preloaded apps that I had to uninstall, only the basic apps. I can use up my internal memory for other apps that are more important. The front camera was awesome, looked very similar to the camera of my Samsung S7. The amazing part was it was the FRONT camera. The back camera was even more amazing. Any vaction landscaping pictures will look absolutely amazing. The speaker was louder than any sony phone I've owned. I usally use the bluetooth for headphones or the car stereo. However, anyone looking to listen to jams this is great. The 4GB RAM was good enough for me. I ran multiple applications at once without a problem. The battery ran good throughout the day without dying. The last thing that to mention that other find important is the fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint sensor was disable on my phone. I personally don't mind it but to others its the end of the world. This phone feels, looks, and runs great.",1,"Sony"

"1968","B071JP8XDJ",2,"true","First off - I purchased this phone almost exclusively for the ""great camera""..... Sadly it was immediately evident that the camera is REALLY not as impressive as you would expect from looking at the specs. I did, however, love the phone itself so much that I decided to just accept the terrible picture quality and enjoy the phone for what it is. Unfortunately after owning it for a few months defects have quickly been emerging that are both frustrating and unexpected considering the phone itself wasn't exactly cheap. This has occurred, ironically, outside of Amazon's return window so I guess I paid several hundred dollars to get a bigger, unreliable phone with a terrible camera. Some of the glitches include: sound not playing, sound switching to the phone ear piece randomly when it shouldn't, the screen randomly locking itself, the phone freezing frequently, the phone not turning on, the touch screen randomly not working and several other issues. All of these problems require me to restart the phone to resolve them and, as I said before - sometimes it won't turn back on. I would definitely pass on getting this phone unless you just want a larger phone with tons of glitches and a faux ""bezel less"" screen that has you randomly hitting buttons just from holding the phone. I truly wish this had been a better experience.",NA,"Sony"
"1969","B071JP8XDJ",5,"true","Beautifully slim, sleek and elegant. So far no problems and the camera is awesome! The connectivity issue people are going on about doesn't happen to me.

"1971","B071JP8XDJ",2,"true","I purchased this phone in December of 2018 (just over eight months ago as of this writing) and about a month ago, I started having charge issues--it would be on the charger, and the slightest touch would stop it from charging. And even when it stays ""charging"" it often took a whole day to get even 40%. Apparently this is a problem with Sony phones across the board. Their customer service takes forever to respond, and at one point my phone ran out of battery and just wouldn't charge, at all. Luckily it's still under the company warranty, so I'm hoping to send it in and get it fixed, but it'll take 14 business days for them to do it. The phone itself works well when it is charged; the camera quality isn't quite what I'd hoped for but the screen resolution is great and it operates fast. But it is *not* worth the hassle.

This phone is quick, snappy and works well. The biggest downfall is the camera. The quality (especially low light) is miserable. I went from my Pure view Zeiss lens to this trashy camera, and what a difference. Slow, blurry, bad white balance, it goes on. Other than that, I love the phone. It seems like everything is faster, even my mobile data connection is faster. It's a huge phone, but still easy to handle. The side controls are placed where they should be. It's not overladen with bloatware from the manufacturer. A few simple tweaks and this phone is running like a boss. I picked mine up from Best Buy for $350 with a free $50 gift card, bringing the price to $300. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a phone this good at sub $400.

I can connect other Android devices to my car, watch, headphones and other home devices with no problem but this particular phone will not stay connected after it has successfully paired.

"2068","B071JP8XDJ",5,"false","No bloatware. Excellent battery life, camera, and UI. Sony has done minimal changes to the interface and is very close to the stock android experience. I can multitask with the phone, which is great because I use my phone a lot for both work and personal emails. It helps me keep up with meetings and appointments. 4 gigs of ram keeps the phone fast and responsive. I live the large screen area, it seems like the same size as the Moto Nexus 6, but with more screen size and nice rounded corners. Good thing there's an SD slot because I can easily imagine myself eating up the all of the onboard storage of the phone. On design, it is very nice to feel and look at... the nice rounded edges, chamfered edges, edge to edge picture (at least side to side, top and bottom still has a sizable bar). Sony picture quality is superior and the cameras front and back take great pics. Video quality is excellent, but I didn’t see how to take 4k video … Overall it's all high quality and it's fun to use. This is far better than the previous model of Xperia XA. The camera takes nice and clear selfie pictures and its wide. Works well with T-Mobile LTE. Nice screen 6 inch size and lighter than the previous model. Highly recommended.",7,"Sony"
"2069","B071JP8XDJ",3,"false","The Ultra is a is first and foremost a camera phone, emphasis on “camera”. the 60 megapixel camera with LED flash on the back allows for vivid picture/video capturing and the 8 megapixel camera in the front captures great lighting yet slightly grainy images. the phone is an ample 6 inches making it one of the bigger phones out there, it is the epitome of a phablet. saying that it is surprisingly light and if you do not mind maneuvering the phone with both hands it is overall very user friendly. It packs a ton of contrast and brightness, a great upgrade from the 5.5 Xperia XA1 which is lightly more opaque. At 3 GB of RAM the phone does a good job at multi tasking apps, and it works just fine if you use various simple apps at a time, I have had no issue interchanging between Facebook, you tube, and looking up several things on google chrome that re directed me to other websites not counting your basic texting and calling. The phone has a micro SD and SIM card slot on the bottom side, and its slot cover is attached to the holder for the chip, allowing for more manageable insertion and extraction. Design-wise, the Ultra although obviously big, makes up for it in sleekness and weightlessness. it is as thin as the iPhone and surprisingly light at 6 ounces. Screen wise, the phone’s frame is almost unnoticeable on on left and right sides when held vertically and its upper and lower frame sections obviously wider to accommodate for the camera lens up top and command bar on the bottom. The command bar blends well into the the screen and has no actual home push button, which was a bit of an adjustment for me as I am used to the iPhone design. Horizontally held, the dimensions are very well designed, allowing for great dimension video watching and landscape document viewing. One of the big design faux pas of the Ultra is shape of its four corners. They are rounded vertically not horizontally which make for an edgy grasp that is uncomfortable when extending the thumb. However, I really liked the positioning and ease of push of the side buttons as they are placed along the upper middle of the right side, and more responsive than the buttons on the iPhone in my opinion. I also was pleasantly surprised with the shutter button as it allows for easy picture taking without having to unlock the phone; a feature that further highlights the camera as its piece de resistance. Material wise, the screen glass is easy to clean, scratch resistant and has been surprisingly durable after a few drops. However, the backside cover, although a matte style material, it is prone to absorbing oils , making it look greasy and dirty with every use. I also noticed that the back side sinks in slightly, which brings to light that the phone material is equivalent to its price in many respects. Installation was a bit of a hassle with my provider (Tmobile) as I could not transfer my old SIM card to this phone because it did not fit. Finally, the 2,620mAh battery uses the Qnovo Adaptor which is supposed to extend its life and performance, allowing for up to 13 hours of talk and last up to 28 in stand by. I found that after continuous use throughout the day without watching videos, the battery life is at around 25% at the end of the day without any charge or placing STAMINA MODE, not bad as far as battery life in my opinion. It uses the USB Type-C port, which I do not like as those ports are less common and I constantly loose my chargers I so I have found myself buying two replacement adaptors already. Overall, I was pleased with the function of the phone, specially the camera, and liked that although large, the phone made good adjustments to compensate. I must say although this is not a travel or female clothing pocket friendly phone, so the fact that carrying it is a hassle in itself diminishes its capacity of use.",4,"Sony"

"2080","B071JP8XDJ",5,"false","This review is for the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra 6"" Factory Unlocked Phone - 32GB - White. It has a host of modern features, including a borderless 6"" edge to edge display in full 1080p HD, 2.5D curved 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass. The glass isn't curved like you see in those curved LED TVs but rather rounded/beveled at the edges. The XA1 also has image enhancement built in. The size of this phone is rather large. It is bigger than an iPhone 7. I suspect you might be challenged over bringing it aboard certain Middle East to London flights that have electronic device size restrictions currently in place. The main camera of the XA1 is 23MP, featuring Hybrid Autofocus, Quick Launch and Capture, 24mm wide-angle, 5x Clear Image Zoom, Low-light, and SteadyShot. The front facing camera is 16MP and features a 23mm wide-angle lens, Exmor R for mobile image sensor, Low-light, Smart Selfie Flash, and Optical Image Stabilizer. The MP rating doesn't mean a lot to me. MP quantity is only relative to the camera's sensor quality, its processor, and the optical quality of the lens being used. You'll also need good lighting, proper (auto) focus, exposure and other conditions. As a long term iPhone user, I find the image quality of iPhone shots sufficient for my needs. This phone produces fairly good shots on par with the iPhone 7. I like the image stabilization of the front facing camera. I find that this camera has some issues with very bright light and very low light. I don't buy a phone for its camera though (and selfies don't define me) so this isn't a deal-breaker for me. Sound is impressive, with xLOUD, Clear Audio+ and SmartAmp. The XA1 (non-Ultra) does not have the SmartAmp. I use Bluetooth Liberte XL headphones with it and the sound is pretty good. This phone comes with 32GB onboard storage space and can be expanded to 256GB with a suitable high speed mircroSD card. The OS utilizes 4GB internal RAM. The processor is a MediaTek Helio P20 Octa-core processor, built in a 16nm process using the ARM Cortex A53 architecture. This processor has a nice mix of good power efficiency and processing performance at its price point. This phone is unlocked and compatible with GSM/LTE carriers utilizing GSM network. It charges using USB-C which is something you might as well get ready for. I like USB-C because it is reversible (about time) and my laptop has a USB-C port. The SIM cards it takes are Single SIM (Nano-SIM) - G3221, G3223, Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by) - G3212, G3226. The OS is Android 7.0 (Nougat). WiFi is 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, Wi-Fi Direct, and it has hotspot support. My router is 802.11n so I am happy with the WiFi. Setup for me was easy and I did need to do some ""housecleaning"" as well as lots of updates. I am currently using this phone on international travel and it has worked well on all the networks I've roamed through or used local SIM cards in. Check with your cell provider on whether the hone will work with their network before you buy. Overall - this phone is a bit large for me but it has a lot of features for the price. The Sony name doesn't inspire awe as I just had a bad experience with one of their Bravia TV's, but the build quality of this phone is about what you would expect from a Sony at its mass production price point. I would recommend it to a friend or anyone wanting a larger phone with edge-to-edge display.",17,"Sony"

"2092","B071JP8XDJ",4,"false","I'm kind of surprised we're talking about a budget phone that cost just under $300. Used to get flip phones for $60. Somehow they have trained us we need smart phones and pay through the nose for them. The phone does have a good camera and does work well in low light. But there are other issues I have with this phone. First off, it is big. And I used to carry a Nexus 6 (which was huge). I don't like the larger form factor. Though you do get more screen for the buck here. Usable screen space is bigger than my Pixel XL. Setup did not go smoothly for me. I don't know if it is the phone or google that was the problem. I would get the confirm request on my primary phone (Pixel XL) but the XA1 didn't seem to get the acknowledgement. Finally turning the phone off and on again I was able to get past that point. It does have a nice augmented reality app to spice up your photos. Also runs Android v7.0. Though it only has the April 2017 security update so I'm not sure how timely Sony is pushing out security updates. So why not 5 stars? Well, there are a couple of other quirks. It does not see my 5G WiFi. I'm kind of surprised about that. I don't know how much money that is saving them thus keeping the price of this phone down. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing yet. Screen resolution is lower than I'd like. It is completely usable as it is. Just not great. Apps, including the Google apps, don't seem to always function. For example, it was updating apps from the Play store when all of the sudden it claimed that Google services was not responding. Restarting the phone seems to make apps function again. I'm hoping this is just the fact the phone is out of the box and needs to get all the updates to stabilize. So overall that phone is nice. Unlocked is always good because you can swap out your SIM if you are travelling. Certainly a much more affordable phone than the competition.",4,"Sony"

When I saw it was advertised as having a great camera, I was excited and initially I was very happy with it and all of the options. It's just not quite as crisp as I hoped it would be but I like the way it takes the photos and how easy it is to photograph objects. I like the larger size of this phone as well. Everything is clearer and much easier to see. If you aren't used to the size you will have to get used to it to feel comfortable. It definitely needs a case to makes it easier to hold. The setup was very easy - Google based. And it had a tutorial on there for me as a person coming from an iphone. You can choose from a menu of what you have been using and it tailors the tutorial to you based on what you choose. It works for ATT and T-Mobile it says. I'm an ATT customer and have no issues with this phone. I had been considering getting the iphone Plus but it won't be necessary now and I'm more comfortable with the Android than I thought I would be. I had heard that changing my icons and settings might feel more difficult but it was no big deal at all. It does have options for you to restore your data from your old phone as well. The only problem I've noticed after using it a few months is that it sometimes crashes when I'm using apps. It doesn't lose any of my data but I'm just not sure why it's doing that. It's not often enough to be an issue though - very rare. I'm very happy with this phone and it's all I need.",4,"Sony"

"2104","B074P62MW8",5,"false","I've had this phone for a month now and think it is amazing. The operating system is blazing fast, and screen resolution is astounding. Battery life has blown my mind.. Dont be put off by the 2800MaH battery.. I can go 2 days without charging it on medium use. Android 8.0 works perfectly and I have yet to run into a hardware problem too. If you're a music junky, this phone is for you. Paired with a high transfer rate SD card, this phone can hold 60 gb of my music without any slowing down due to high amounts of data storage. The music app from Sony is second-to-none. It is integrated with Spotify too and is the most seamless I've ever used. The only negative is the camera. Low light photos are limited... And the resolution is not as great as you'd expect from Sony. I'm a DSLR user and don't rely on my phone for images, so I personally don't care. Don't get me wrong, image quality is still 8/10 overall, but if you're a person that takes 50 gb of photos on your phone you might wanna look elsewhere. The front facing camera is 10/10 though.

"2105","B074P62MW8",4,"false","This is a quality phone that can compete with others in this price range. It doesn't really stand out, but it doesn't fall short either. Whether you want the phone or not might just come down to how you feel about the design, with its larger bezel and sleek black slab design. At 1080p the resolution is nothing special for a phone that costs 600+, but how many pixels do you really need on a screen this size? Sony screens have really vibrant colors and deep blacks, and look great. But if you feel you really need a super high def screen you can look elsewhere. It really runs smoothly and can handle any program from games to apps that I throw at it. With its metallic straight back and front and slightly rounded edges it feels comfortable in the hand. Battery life is also excellent. I can often get two days of use out of it without needing to charge it. The 19mp camera takes sharp, detailed photographs, even when the light is a bit low. One major shortcoming is the lack of a fingerprint scanner. I've read if you have some tech savvy you can unlock that ability. The phone is capable of scanning your fingerprint,but that's been disabled in some markets including the US due to patent issues. That and the phones design might be the deciding issue on whether you buy it or not. It does have a large bezel, while other high end phones seem to be moving towards no bezel designs. Personally I like the sleek, no frills slab like design.",2,"Sony"

"2107","B074P62MW8",1,"false","Since I got this phone I am seeing nothing but crap functionality on the device, and crap support forum Sony (aka: 90% of solutions suggested are ""update software"") and I seriously regret my purchase... Since I bought the Xperia XZ1 the following issues have arisen: 1) Alarm clock DOES NOT RING no matter what I do.. whether it's single-time or repeating alarms (I actually use my old Z5 as a alarm clock!). Already did 3 software updates (as per Sony's forums) and none of them worked! 2) Even BASIC PHONE FUNCTIONALITY is broken, as there is about a 75% chance that ANY CALL I get, I am unable to answer as the touchscreen freezes/stops working, and I have to try and relock/unlock 3 or 4 times until it actually responds (if at all!). 3) The ""Adaptive Display"" has become INFURIATING, as it doesn’t stop changing screen brightness up and down even when I don't move it at all! And turning it off is not even an option, as the screen the screen is LITERALLY invisible if I'm using the same setting between going outside and into my car, for example. I've tried backlight control and without it, and tried every setting i could find.. NOTHING. And just having it at high brightness all the time is not an option either since THE BATTERY DRAINS LIKE A SEWAGE PIPE! 4) I have PROVEN beyond a doubt in my mind and out of personal experience that Sony's software updates DO actually SLOW DOWN THE PHONE! After being happy with my Xperia Z5, thinking it just slowed down over a couple of years of use, it took a bad fall and the sim card stopped working properly (signal comes and goes)...And since ""fixing it"" was literally more expensive than buying a new one, I went out and bought an exact same BRAND NEW Xperia Z5 out of the box for 200 less. It was working GREAT. However, I kept getting notifications to update the software, so I did... after doing about 5 or 6 updates in a row, the phone LITERALLY went down to the EXACT SAME turtle-slow speed as the 2-YEAR-OLD one!!!! I've tried EVERYTHING, and until now the phone is as slow, sluggish and laggy as the phone I abused for over 2 years! Sony is OBVIOUSLY guilty of slowing phones down with their updates! 5) The GPS is absolute GARBAGE on this phone! On a DAILY basis the phone GPS stops working and just can't find a GPS signal on ALL apps that use GPS. I've tried everything from software updates to deleting cache to uninstalling and reinstalling apps...etc. NOTHING. And this all in the exact same house, office, and destinations I go to every day, and had used my old Z5 with no issues whatsoever, and still do! 6) The last and most important point is the fact that Sony keeps trying to FORCE ME to do MORE software updates, and I know FOR A FACT from personal experience that the software updates constantly slow down the phone, AND there is a high chance of them screwing something ELSE up. And yet, I still did 3 updates so far hoping it will fix ANY of these issues.. not ONE of them was resolved! Oh, and all this was posted on the Sony forums for support.. not even ONE reply from any of their support teams. So what the )(*&^!#*%^!#*)& is wrong with Sony?! Conclusion... Sony Never Again!",4,"Sony"

The selfie camera alone on this phone takes amazing pictures but I am getting quality shots like never before with any other phone which is great because we do a lot of hiking and camping and lake time and it doesn't make since to us to carry a huge camera around for awesome pictures. The phone with minimal use gets 3-4 days of battery and even when streaming or heavy use sti gets a full 2+ days. The quality I have always seen from Sony phones is here with the performance that makes me laugh at those who pay 2-3 times as much for inferior phones. Best buy I have made in quite some time.",1,"Sony"

"2114","B074P62MW8",4,"false","Sony’s new Xperia XZ1 delivers what you would expect from a Sony flagship - rock solid performance that’s not quite best in class, together with a distinctive design that you’ll either love or hate. Basic details. In case you’re wondering, this takes a nano-sim, charges through a USB-C port, and accepts microSDXC memory. (You can use the memory slot either for expanded memory or for a second sim). What’s great: - The phone is blazing fast, and somehow gets very good battery life out of a 2700 mAh battery. I'm a heavy user, and I can't quite make it to the end of day, but that's a lot longer than most android phones, and I suspect you could get a full day out of normal use. There are a huge number of battery settings, so you definitely have a lot of control of performance vs lifetime. - It’s designed with Asian flexibility: two sim card slots for any double-sim users, or you can put up to 256 mb of microSDX memory in the second sim slot to supplement the onboard 64 mb of memory. The controllers are quite good - I appreciate that there's a dedicated camera button for when you want to capture a shot right away in addition to a volume rocker and power button/fingerprint scanner. - The OS is very clean - this is one of the first phones to get Android 8, and has a clean version that's a pleasure to use. With the exception of an annoying sporadic ""Google connectivity services has stopped working"" error (that doesn't seem to actually prevent any services from working), I haven't seen any problems at all - between the fast hardware and the clean OS, everything just works. - Although not directly relevant to this model, it’s worth mentioning that Sony also makes one of the only high end compact android models, this phone’s sister model, the Xperia XZ1 Compact. While I’m OK with a 5.2 inch screen (plus bezels!) people looking for a one-hand phone should definitely check that out. What’s (very) good: - Screen: The screen is a 1080p LCD with HDR support. It looks very good, but there are better screens on the market. I actually think this is a good compromise, as the (relatively) limited screen increases battery life and speed, and looks great from my perspective, but if you want the absolute best looking screen you can get, this isn’t it.. - Camera: This packs a 19MP, 4k video camera on the back, with special software to take slow motion segments, burst shots, and various features designed to get better shots in motion and low light conditions. The pictures are certainly the best out of any phone I've owned, but Sony is still disappointing in low light condition, and from what I read, some of the competition's top end cameras take better pictures under low light conditions. - Speakers: Front stereo speakers produce relatively good sound for a phone. ""For a phone"" being the key qualifier - the speakers are still tinny compared to real speakers or a headset, but they're not bad. - Waterproof: This is rated IP65/68, which means it has successfully been tested resisting every possible size of dust as well as jets of water and submersion under at least a meter of water. You can wash this phone off under a flowing tap, and you can drop it in the sink without water damage. (Note that Sony doesn’t recommend using your phone underwater, and that it’s very important that your USB port be completely dry before you start to charge.) What could be better - Fingerprint sensor. My understanding is that due to a patent dispute, Sony phones like this one have their fingerprint sensor intentionally disabled in the US software. Unless you're prepared for some OS hacking, that means no fingerprint sensor, which is a drag. - Bezels: The new trend is for bezel-less phones, but Sony is bucking that trend (for now) It gives you a place to hold the phone, and allows for a very slim phone, but they do stand out. - XPeria Mobile Transfer: This is the second Xperia model my family has gotten, and I've never gotten Xperia Mobile Transfer to work. This time, I tried to transfer call logs and texts from my Nexus 6P - I probably tried 12 times, including wireless, PC, and NFC several times each, but could never get it to transfer. (I got to step 5 of 6 several times, though!) Finally I just used easybackup and dropbox. All in all, this is a nice piece of hardware. It's reliable, clean and fast and pretty good at everything it does. You can get a better camera, screen or speaker package if that's your thing, but this is a reasonable compromise and a phone I'm planning to use for at least a few years.",3,"Sony"

"2126","B074P62MW8",4,"false","Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  The Sony Xperia XZ1 is an Android phone with impressive speed and features. However, for me, there are a few issues that make me wonder if switching from my iPhone to this smartphone was the right choice? Some of those things are Android-based issues and I'll try not to focus on them in this review. Truly the biggest caveats I have about this smartphone is its lack of a fingerprint security in the US model, grainy photos when using zoom, and the flimsy SIM card door. ------------------------------------------------------ ☆ WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS PHONE ☆ ➤ The HD 1080P display in 'Super Vivid Mode' is glorious! Whether viewing photos on Pinterest or watching 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' on Amazon Prime Video, the 5.2"" screen is a joy to view. ➤ It has NFC (Near Field Communication) which iPhones lack and I enjoy using for sharing photos and transferring files between my phone and my Sony Vaio laptop. ➤ The case is metal and very sturdy. ➤ It has 3D photo capabilities for faces, whole heads, food or objects. Your 3D captures can be sent off to be printed or used in animated videos. Sony promises even more with this tech in the future as AR becomes a big thing. ➤ This phone takes amazing slo-mo video in 6-second bursts at the highest frame rate available (920 frames-per-second) on a smartphone at this time. ➤ Tutorials on the phone for adding VPN and similar are very helpful. ➤ Extra-wide selfie shots from the 13 MP front-facing camera on this phone are great! ➤ Sharp photos from the up to 19 MP rear-facing camera (adjustable in Settings) are better than similar ones taken with my iPhone 5S. ➤ Call quality using Cricket Wireless (AT&T) is excellent. ➤ Was able to easily pair this phone with my Uconnect system on my 2017 Jeep Cherokee for calls and to receive texts through the system. ➤ The phone is fast when opening apps and using WiFi. The Android 8.0 Oreo operating system with the 835 Snapdragon processor is wonderful. ➤ Excellent battery life if making calls and texting with the occasional photo. (This drops off significantly if taking video.) ➤ In Settings, you can adjust your battery's STAMINA level. With a 'balanced' setting my phone lasted 25 hours. This setting restricted my use with 15% battery left per my settings. ULTRA STAMINA mode is also available and limits available apps to save on battery usage. ➤ The sound is excellent! Whether using Bluetooth headphones or without any headphones at all, you can enjoy watching videos both; audio and video, with this phone. ➤Xperia Tips are helpful! Use 'Assist' in Settings. ➤ The touchscreen is very responsive. ➤ The side buttons for power and volume are well places and have a good feel to them. ➤ It still has a 3.5mm headphone jack! ➤ LED Flash - great for selfies. ➤ Expandable storage up to 256GB with (not included micro SD card). ➤ Predictive autofocus and photo taking with smile recognition. ➤ Dual SIM card capability. ➤ The phone charges quickly via the included USB cable. ➤ LTE data works well on the phone as does WiFi. ➤ It's water-resistant up to 3'! This means if it falls in the toilet, you'll probably still be able to use it and you don't have to worry about using it in the rain. ➤ Automatic Backup of your phone can be set up within Settings to go to a cloud-based storage or the micro-SD card (not included) in your phone. --------------------------------------------- ☀︎ WHAT I WISH WAS BETTER ☀︎ ➤ NO FINGERPRINT READER? At least not if you are purchasing this phone in the US. Makes no sense to me Sony. Not at this price point anyway. **There are tutorials on YouTube about how to enable this feature, but this should not be attempted by novice techies as it is possible to damage your phone. ** ➤ Photos can appear dark and many needed 'automatic' adjustment to suit me. Good lighting = great photos with this phone. Low lighting = not so much. ➤ Zoom on the camera works fine, but photos taken with the zoom on tend to be noisy with a grainy quality to them. ➤ Despite being water-resistant, the door to the SIM card and micro-SD card slots is flimsy. The door on my phone broke off upon the first gentle opening of it. It still works, but it doesn't pull out and pivot as it should. ➤ Directions that come with the phone are terrible. Small, incomplete and pretty much useless. Watching YouTube videos helped me figure out the SIM card installation and I've done this sort of thing probably a dozen times before with other phones. Novices may want to take their unlocked Xperia to their network provider for installation. ➤ The 5.2"" screen is not edge to edge due to a slightly curved, rectangular bezel. ➤ Only 6 seconds of slo-mo video bursts can be taken. They are fantastic, but it's easy to miss the shot. See attached video to this review. ➤ The 3D scanning and resulting 3D images are cool, but not sure how to use them or why I need them. A novelty for sure! ➤ The design of the phone is very plain and may be underwhelming to some users. ➤ Not compatible with Boost Mobile, Verizon Wireless Prepaid or Virgin Mobile. Did get it to work on the Cricket Wireless and T-Mobile prepaid networks. ➤ Using this phone to text an iPhone has its issues (this is for all Android devices though). I had to install the Pulse App to try and get an iMessage experience across multiple platforms. Not thrilled with it, but it does work with both my Mac and PC too using a paid version of the app. ➤ Android Oreo is fast, but I've had the phone freeze up when using the calling app and photos. Calls don't go through or they go through and won't hang up, which is the worst part of it. ----------------------------------------------- In conclusion, there's a lot to like about the Sony Xperia ZX1 Unlocked *US version smartphone, but at this price point, I wonder if it's enough? I still can't decide. It certainly has a beautiful display, great cameras and is super-zippy in its performance. However, it lacks a fingerprint reader (can be enabled if you watch YouTube videos and are daring enough to try) in the US version which even with a 3D camera and water-resistance may be a dealbreaker for some. ---------------------------------------- NOTE: Video was taken at the 2017 Nike Invitational XC meet in Portland, Oregon on 9/30/17. It shows regular video taken from the Xperia ZX1 interspersed with 6-second bursts of 920 fps slow-motion video. ------------- 10/3/17: Off of Ebay I purchased a USA SONY Style Cover Touch SCTG50 case for this phone. It's on the Sony site, but currently not available for US buyers from other sources. The case was sixty bucks, but well worth it as it protects the back and the front of the phone without hindering its usage. And for those who are moving from an iOS to an Android device and missing iMessage, check out the Pulse App (paid version is eleven bucks for a lifetime subscription). I have it on my Mac and now can text from my Mac instead of picking up my phone to do it. Works on Mac and PC's as well as Android tablets and iOS tablets via a web browser. ------------------ 10/16/17: So I've been using this phone with the Style Cover Touch and I like it for not adding bulk and protecting both the screen and back. Not great for bounce protection though, and pricey. It does come with an app that enables either using the screen through the front flap or as a sleep-wake feature. The more I use this ZX1 the less I feel committed to using it for the long haul. Part of it is the providers I have in my local area. Maybe it's just a matter of hitting upon the right combination? I have enjoyed how it pairs and works seamlessly with my Uconnect system in my 2017 Jeep. And it does have a beautiful display. However, I've also noticed that while this phone while super fast, looks and sounds fabulous and takes nice photos - the operating system is not as stable as I'd wish it to be. Some other issues... The lack of support for messaging between the Android atmosphere and iOS. Yes, this is not the fault of the hardware, but rather software not playing nice, but it's darned annoying! Several times I've had to put down my phone and use my iPad to message my daughter who uses an iPhone as messaging just wasn't playing nice. Messages on my end would not send despite multiple retries. Despite the volume being 'up' on the phone, sometimes I find it difficult to get my ear over the speaker to have consistently good audio. The speakerphone is fine, but I don't always want that or to use a Bluetooth headset. The phone has frozen on me six different times. It has happened when I've been trying to answer a call. Sometimes with all the bells and whistles, it's tough to remember that calls are important too, but they are... at least for me. Maybe I'm just asking too much for seven hundred dollars? ===================================",8,"Sony"

After several emails they have told me that 1. the phone was originally sold to Panama and they do not have the tools to fix it in the US. 2. I requested they replace the phone and Sony has stated that since it was sold to Panama Sony in the US is not able to replace the phone as warranties are different in each country. SO BEWARE OF THIS!

"2133","B074P62MW8",5,"true","I am an employee of Sony and have used the Xperia phones since the old ZL from 2013. Of course these were company phones, but we had a choice of using these phones which were free or paying for Samsung or iPhones. Of course I chose the Xperia. Since Sony ditched carrier based phones, the bloat-ware on these is almost non-existent. You get the Android OS with a minimal Sony overlay. But that is it...no AT&T apps, No T-mobile carp, and certainly no Verizon bloat or two year later updates. And I think that is the main reason why Sony ditched the carrier based phone- Updates. Anyway, the XZ1 is fast, thin and good looking. It does what I want, has lots of room for storage of pics and video that can be shot in normal mode or with their awesome slo-mo video. The only draw back I can find is that while it is dual sim, meaning you can have two sim cards with two different numbers. For example you can have a US based AT&T sim card then travel to Japan and use a Japanese based sim card at the same time and switch between the two. But the problem is, that second sim card is used at the expense of the SD Card, which will need to be removed. Other than that, the screen is huge and crystal clear, the buttons are where they should be, and it does exactly what it's supposed to. I highly recommend a case with a tactile feel as this phone is smooth and slippery..",4,"Sony"

"2135","B074P62MW8",1,"true","I have had a Sony Xperia Z5 for a few years. Loved the phone, but camera lens got scratched and Sony US won't fix since they can't get parts. Reasonable enough. Really liked the fingerprint reader on the old phone and it had also died recently. So I got this phone as a replacement. Man do I miss my old phone. The fingerprint reader was there during setup, then disappeared after it realized it was in the US. I know I can hack the system and download other country's OK, but why should I need to go through this. Can you imagine Apple users being asked to do this? There is no ""star"" feature on the text message to avoid deleting important texts, the address book's up/down slider is all odd - you have to flick down once, before you can use it. Once you start typing a text message, you can't tell which SIM it will use and you can't change the choice even if it is wrong.They took away the SIP phone (which was lumpy, but worked once you got used to it). So many steps backwards. Oh, and a big deal for me, you can have dual SIM, or one SIM and a memory card, but not all three. And Sony, what is up with not being able to restore an Xperia backup from one generation to the next generation? Why do a backup at all using Sony software? I'd still rather have this phone than a Samsung because Sony updates the OS frequently which I think is important, but otherwise really really disappointed in the management decisions.",5,"Sony"
"2136","B074P62MW8",4,"true","I got this phone in ""Used - Like New"" condition from the Amazon Warehouse and it came with the original box and accessories. The phone was in great condition with no noticeable flaws, so that was nice to see. As for the phone itself, it's pretty good, even now in late-2018. As has been mentioned a bunch before, the fingerprint sensor doesn't work on US models, so take that as you will. Flashing other firmware to enable it is possible, but I didn't feel like going through the hassle. I'm glad it keeps the headphone jack, the last Sony flagship to do so I believe. The software is nice with almost no major bloatware, aside from a few pre-installed apps, which can easily be disabled for the most part. The phone is also running Android 9.0 Pie, which is cool to see and Sony is fairly good about putting out security updates each month, although for how much longer that will continue is hard to say. There's no OLED display, just LCD, but Sony makes some amazing looking displays, so it hardly matters in this case. Battery life has also been good, not fantastic, but good. Sony's ""Stamina"" mode definitely helps to extend battery life when necessary. There are some other software tweaks that Sony has done which help make the things run more smoothly, but nothing major enough to distract from the standard Android experience. Aside from the fingerprint sensor not working, the only other downside is the camera. It's not terrible, but for a 2017 phone, I certainly expected more. It can take some good shots outdoors with good lighting, but they're average quality at best. Software updates have only marginally improved things. Overall, just okay. With all that being said, if you're still looking for something good in 2018/19 and you're alright with an average camera and no fingerprint sensor by default, this is still a great phone that has the latest updates and doesn't skip a beat.

Also, the lux sensor or the screen brightness adjustment is behaving as it should be a beta product. When the screen brightness adjusts according to the lighting environment, it does not shift smoothly, but in very annoying jumps. Can be avoided by having a fixt brightness level, but that is not good enough for a flagship phone. Also, Sony just dismisses these claims. Worst customer care.

"2158","B074P62MW8",2,"true","So before this I owned the Moto G4 (not a impressive phone and not impressed with what lenovo did to Motorola) and before that I owned a Motorola X Pure (my favorite android phone of all time) and seeing as how this was my first venture into a sony branded android phone I really wanted to love it... but I don't. What ruins this phone for me. Bezels- So to start with everyone talks about it but you don't realize it until you see it are the bezels, now I'm not looking for a bezelless display but this thing is ridiculous, there are 7 year old phones running symbian that have smaller sized bezels than this phone does. Photos and videos don't do it justice you have to get this thing in your hands and use it to understand how bad it is. It makes the device unnecessarily big, the screen feel smaller than it really is, and it makes the device looks cheap. Camera- On paper the camera should be great but in real world use it's just average at best. It doesn't perform particularly well in low light and no matter what the lighting conditions are pictures turn out blurry for some reason. I know it doesn't have optical image stabilization but neither do my other phones and I don't that issue with them. Bottom line the camera is good but it doesn't feel like it should be on a flagship phone at least not one in 2017. Sony apps- These things are annoying they constantly pop up with ads trying to get you to buy stuff you don't want and on top of that the stuff they sell is broken, for example the themes after a few days glitch out and don't display properly unless you reset your phone and on top of it you have to pay for them. The worst part is you can't disable or uninstall these, you might be able to disable notifications from them but they are always there. I paid $700 for a device only for it to show me ads? If I wanted that I would have brought a prime phone! Honestly I could keep going on like how the display is average, no fingerprint scanner, and the also mediocre battery life but I think you get the point by now. For $600 I would bump my rating up from 3 stars up to 4 but I didn't pay the $600 no I paid the $742 which is what this device cost when it came out just two months ago. The only real positives I can say about this device is the build quality is fantastic, the processor is top of the line, and the speakers are better than at least 95% of phones today. everything else is just bleh.",3,"Sony"

"2161","B074P62MW8",5,"false","I bought the international unlocked version because I was too impatient to wait until it was officially available in the US, but I had to come here and share my thoughts about the XZ1. First of all, this is finally what feels like a truly matured phone from Sony. From design to camera, it finally feels like Sony has something that can compete with the rest of the phones out there. I'm gonna break up my thoughts below by pros and cons. Pros: - I love the updated design with its curved back and slim profile. The phone is much easier to hold in the hand. - The display, even for a 1080p, it's gorgeous and more than what any mobile user needs. The color enhancements give you enough options to customize it to your liking. - HDR support on Amazon Prime and Youtube is sweet. - The battery is crazy good. I had the S8+ and it would only last from 6am to 9pm before I needed to recharge on a normal work day with heavy use. Not sure what Sony (and Oreo) did, but I can make it to 9pm and still packing 45% of the battery. CRAZY good. - The software is the usual smooth as silk from Sony. The light enhancements on top of the stock Android add character but doesn't take away from the performance in the least bit when compared to the Pixel. - The camera experience has been dramatically improved over the past Xperia phones. I tried out the XZs and hated the camera, and while the XZ1 packs the same camera sensor, they finally did something with the post processing and the results are impressive. The camera shutter is much more responsive, so no more missed or blurry shots. - The slow video is a cool feature, but you can only take advantage of it in good lighting. - Sony has the best fingerprint scanner implementation, period. Having it built as part of the power button is in the most ideal location and it's crazy fast and accurate. - Headphone jacks are still great, and I'm glad to see Sony isn't jumping on that bandwagon yet. Cons: - I'm not on the same anti-bezel craze that everyone is on, but it would be nice to see Sony start to move in that direction. I personally feel like the phone is much easier to use when compared to the S8+ and the likes, so I could care less either way. - The stereo speakers are nice and loud, but a little too ""high"" in note. - [UPDATE AFTER 1 WEEK OF USE] I'm noticing that the display's oleophobic (anti-fingerprint) coating isn't as good as some other phones. The screen gets packed with fingerprints very easily. It's definitely worse when compared to the Samsung or iPhone and much worse compared to the OnePlus 3T (which had the best oleophobic coating of any phone I've ever used). Again, you're probably saying ""those bezels in 2017?"" Don't, and don't get turned off by them. The phone is still a beautiful piece of hardware and the usability beats any edge-to-edge display.",66,"Sony"
"2162","B074P62MW8",4,"true","When I first got this telephone I gave you the high rating because it seems like it worked perfectly now probably less than 3 months later I am having nothing but absolute, excuse my expression, hell with it. Of course it is too late to exchange the phone, so my next step is going to be trying to find out what I have to do to get the warranty to either fix it or replace it and I am not happy at all.

I really wanted this phone for the materials, the processor, the storage, and the speakers, but the lack of basic ""flagship"" features at this price point makes this phone look like a tease.

"2166","B074P62MW8",5,"false","As one of the first non-Pixel/Nexus phones to be sold with Android 8 (Oreo), I had expected to be surprised by some new changes in functionality, but it appears that most of the differences between Android 7 and 8 are under the hood, and I was able to start using the XZ1 right away without much of a learning curve. Upon setup, SONY offered to sign me up for its own services, but I decided to stay with what I was used to for the time being. The built-in launcher is fast and efficient, but again, for purposes of comparison, I installed the Google Now Launcher and the GBoard keyboard, so as to have a direct means of comparison with my previous phones. The default keyboard is Swift. There are a number of SONY apps pre-installed on the phone, but with the exception of the [media and photo] Album, I have stuck to the standard Google-provided apps. I have to say that this phone is very fast! I did not notice any lagging or stuttering of any kind. Fingerprint reader As many readers probably already know, the fingerprint reader has been disabled in the USA firmware for all of SONY’s phones, due, as I understand it, to a patent restriction. This is unfortunate, but since I have not used a fingerprint reader on a regular basis, it was not really a problem for me personally. Speakers I listen to a lot of podcasts and radio, and the vast majority of telephone calls I make involve the use of the speakerphone, and here the results are somewhat mixed. Although the volume is generally sufficient, I can see that in a slightly noisier environment this may not be the case. The quality is pretty good, although there is noticeable distortion when the volume is turned up more than about ¾ of the way. There are a couple of audio effect modes that can be activated, although none of them seemed to particularly enhance the music that I listen to. It may be that the effects are more suited to game or movie soundtracks. Of recent phones that I’ve tried, the far less expensive Alcatel Idol 5s had better quality and volume, as did the ZTE Axon 7. In an era when it seems to be gradually disappearing, I am glad to see that the 3.5mm headphone jack has been retained on the XZ1. Bluetooth The XZ1 seems to reliably connect to all the Bluetooth devices I’ve tried it with, including a car audio system. The range is comparable to my other phones. EDIT: Oddly, no matter what the app being used for audio playback, remaining time for all tracks always appears as ""0:00"". Must be a limitation in the XZ1's implementation of Bluetooth. Screen The screen is a good size and is bright; I have no difficulty taking pictures outside in the sunlight. The resolution seems perfectly fine; the difference between this screen’s resolution and the higher resolution of its predecessor is not great enough to be of concern to me. Camera ***[Edit 10/23/2017: There is some distortion of the captured image towards the edges of the frame. This is most noticeable when you are photographing a subject with a regular pattern. Sony has announced that they have a software fix to address the problem, and will be releasing it by November, 2017.]*** The camera is very fast, and has the sometimes-useful feature whereby it will take a picture or two before you or your subject are actually posed and “ready”. This can sometimes result in a more natural shot, but it doesn’t always work out that way, of course. The camera is very quick to focus, especially where there is sufficient light. I have not experimented with the super-slow-motion video, but you can find examples of it easily in video reviews of this phone. I do appreciate being able to use a button on the side of the phone as a shutter key. It appears that the camera can focus on a subject as close as about 6 cm from the lens. Telephony and Wi-Fi I have not noticed any problems with dropped calls or Wi-Fi connections, and the cell reception seems about on par with what my other phones can do in the same areas. Battery Despite the relatively small size of the battery, I have been able to use the phone all day (06:00-22:00) starting from a single full charge. After using the phone for a number of calls, browsing the web, listening to podcasts and casting via Chromecast each for about an hour, I still had upwards of 40% battery charge by 22:00. I understand that there have been additional optimizations in power management capabilities in Android 8, and this must be an example of those improvements. Undoubtedly the fact that the screen is not of ultra-high resolution must be a factor as well. SONY has claimed that the specialized charging circuitry used helps to increase the long-term life of the battery, and there are a couple of modes that can be enabled if you are running short and cannot recharge the phone. Overall The phone feels good in the hand and has enough weight so that it inspires confidence in its construction. That said, I bought a clear TPU case for a better grip. The case also adds a millimeter or two to the thickness, which makes it easier to pick up the phone when it’s lying flat on a table. I like the fact that the buttons are located only on one side; when buttons are located on opposite sides I tend to accidentally touch one or the other. Conclusion The Sony Xperia XZ1 is an elegant, substantial phone. Both its general design and its specification are a good indication of its flagship status amongst SONY’s current offerings.",4,"Sony"

"2173","B074P62MW8",3,"true","This is a dual-SIM Sony model G8342, codename Poplar_US, Customization Version 1310-4358_R5B. As of November 2017 this phone runs on Sony build 47.1.A.2.374, Oreo 8.0.0, 2017-10-01 patch level. This is important: You may not be able to update the phone to October update over the air, but instead use official XPERIA Companion application from Sony and perform device reset. You definitely want to update your device to the latest version, since it fixes Camera freezes in third-party applications and stops Launcher from fighting you. Summary after almost a month of use: You should get this phone if: • You like metal design and screen size, and • You don't mind taking pictures of mediocre quality (not potato, but details are regularly lost), and • You must use two SIM cards, and • You live in an area with good 2G/3G coverage for regular phone calls, and • You don't need Wi-Fi calling or VoLTE. • You want HDR-capable screen. Otherwise, get the XPERIA XZ1 Compact or wait for other phones with Oreo. We probably should have got the Single-SIM variant, which had a higher chance of supporting Wi-Fi calling and VoLTE, but G8342 is what we now have to deal with. I am returning the phone and plan to get XPERIA XZ1 Compact instead, which has VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling listed as officially supported with a single SIM card. The Good: • Great screen which can slightly alter colors if the device detects broad daylight (see photo). You can adjust the color temperature and even switch between color profiles. • This is the first Android Oreo phone that comes with a headphone jack. You don't hear the hissing noise/clicks when DAC is turned on/off, and the sound feels... different. I like it. • Camera button, which works in lock screen as well. • Front-facing speakers that produce sound you are unlikely to cover with your fingers. • Android Auto works great. • Front-facing camera is a widescreen one, so it fits more of your face and people around you. The Bad: • The phone is not provisioned for VoLTE in the US market, so you won't have HD Audio, probably due to Dual-SIM support and lack of Sony interest. This makes this phone unusable for calls in areas where LTE is the only option available (such as in areas where only LTE Band 12 is deployed by T-Mobile). • The phone is not provisioned for Wi-Fi calling, so you won't be able to make or receive voice calls if you don't have cell coverage, also possibly due to Dual-SIM configuration. • You'll appreciate the headphone jack, since bluetooth may be unstable, depending on the device you're pairing with. • After a week the following stopped bothering me that much, but the status bar Wi-Fi and mobile internet icons display up/down arrows when activity happens. Unfortunately, when arrows show/hide, the icons to the left are shifted back and forth. The Ugly: • The main camera seems to be worse at details than LG Nexus 5 of 2013 (see sample image, top is XZ1, bottom is Nexus 5). It introduces noise and grain due to over-sharpening which cannot be turned off (don’t forget to complain about that to XPERIA Support). Those are not just JPEG artifacts, or settings you can adjust. You may be tempted to try other camera apps, but that won’t fix the issue. Additionally, camera produces wide-angle distortions, but Sony publicly announced an upcoming fix for that as a setting. Accessories: Unfortunately, neither TechArmor nor RhinoShield have plans to support this phone and Spigen did not react to my question to confirm or deny they are going to bring XZ1 accessories to the US and the currently available selection is disappointing. • Skinomi TechSkin Full Coverage Screen Protector - This is a soft film protector, which should help from scratches and does not change visibility. • Vigeer Crystal Clear Soft TPU Bumper - This is an OK case which will definitely protect the phone, but soft TPU sticks to other plastic (such as badge holders) and looks stretchy. • Roxfit Ultra Slim Soft Touch Shell - This case feels good in hand, but provides protection mostly to the back and the sides of the phone and not so much for the front due to minimal lip.",38,"Sony"

"2175","B074P62MW8",4,"false","Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  INTRODUCTION Sony has a small percentage of the US Android market. They have no carrier relationships to speak of, which puts them behind the eight ball when competing with Samsung, Apple, LG, and even smaller companies like HTC or Google (a small phone company, anyway). And so they are relying on direct sales through online retailers like Amazon to reach us. Should we care? Is there a reason to choose them over one of the bigger players? DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY Sony is not trying to woo new consumers with its design. Sony has been sticking with its “Omni-balance” look for at least five years now. On the one hand, this means a Sony phone is instantly recognizable. Tall-ish top and bottom bezels, smooth edges, premium finishes and colors. The Xz1 body is sculpted from one piece of aluminum, with a smooth, curved glass transition to the Gorilla Glass 5 front panel. The whole phone feels incredibly thin, but not light and plasticky. It is really smooth and slippery, though, so a TPU case at minimum might be a good idea. The metal body remains cool to the touch, even under moderate load. Size-wise, it is slightly larger than a regular iPhone (see pictures). The phone is water- and dust-proof to an IP68 rating. The screen is the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio, not the 18:9 stretched screen that seems to have caught on lately on the trendier small bezel phones. Buttons are placed as along the right side, with a volume rocker, flat power button, and dedicated two step camera button. The power button contains a fingerprint sensor. It is not enabled on US models of this phone. This might be the biggest knock on this model for US consumers. Apparently Sony has some sort of legal issue in the US that they can't or won’t resolve. The sensor is great – fast, accurate, and placed much more sensibly than other phones. As such, if you buy this phone for any of the other (quite valid) reasons, you should consider either choosing the international version, or researching how to flash the UK ROM that enables it. There is also no wireless charging. The bezels allow for a nice pair of front firing stereo speakers, that do a fine job with YouTube, music, and speaker phone calls. The headphone jack along the top provides excellent sound with both the earbuds (not included) and the over-ear headphones I tried. All in all, this is a design that Sony fans will love, average consumers will likely respect but not lust after, and anti-bezel partisans will loathe. But it is premium and solid all the way. Truthfully, the bezels aren’t all that big, being about the same as an iPhone 7 or 8, and the black model ends up looking like an infinity display, too, at least with a dark wallpaper that lets the screen blend into the surround glass, such as the default Xperia Loops animated background. DISPLAY Speaking of the display, it is a 5.2” IPS LCD panel with a 1920x1080 resolution. I can tell you, that with 20/20 vision, the pixels are not apparent at normal or even close-up viewing distances. Color and contrast are excellent, almost looking like an OLED panel. The display gets very bright when it is in a bright place, but also dark enough to be comfortable in a dark room. Sony has really nailed the adaptive backlight, it almost always chooses exactly the right brightness for maximum beauty and legibility. BATTERY LIFE The battery pack is only 2,700 MaH, but it easily provides an all-day charge, even with moderate to heavy use. Also included are two nice software optimizations. Stamina Mode does a great job of reducing background activity to give the user a good extra hour or so in a pinch (or even more if you engage the Ultra Stamina Mode, which renders the smartphone functions inert, like a feature phone). The other big addition is Battery Care, which learns your charging schedule and predicts when you will be taking it off the charger in the morning, let’s say. So, knowing this, it slow charges your phone and lets it hover around 90%, which puts less stress on the battery. Then it quickly tops off in the last hour or so before you unplug. You can easily disable this on a case-by-case or on a more permanent basis. CAMERA This is my number one priority in a smartphone. It’s the camera you always have with you, and as such I want any smartphone I use to be at least competitive with a dedicated point-and-shoot. This camera is most certainly at that level. The 19 megapixel “Motion Eye” sensor is capable of taking good pictures in both daylight and lowlight conditions. The daylight shots are bristling with detail, and are nowhere near as aggressively sharpened as some of Sony’s prior cameras. Low light and indoor lighting shots are good, but not great. Noise is commendably low, though detail is reduced, as it is with practically every smartphone competitor’s camera. There is a single LED flash which can help out, but it has a tendency to wash out a subject or thrown the contrast out of whack a bit, so I prefer to only use it in a pinch. I will say, though, that Superior Auto (the default shooting mode) still occasionally monkeys around with large facial portraits in an unacceptable manner, showing some sort of digital smoothing, and as such, manual mode might be a better bet for people’s faces. But those are not the camera’s unique selling points. The “Motion Eye” moniker comes from the stacked RAM memory built right into the sensor, which acts as an ultra fast buffer, allowing some interesting effects tied to speed. First is 960 fps slow motion. Most competitors top out at 240 fps, so this is a full 4 times slower. Although it is limited to 720p and records just a fraction of a second, stretched out to about 5 seconds (probably for storage reasons), the effect can truly be stunning once you get the timing right. Ocean waves, birds in flight, kids jumping, all look like professionally done slow motion footage as long as you are filming in bright light. The resulting video can either be a short slow-mo clip or a regular movie clip with bursts of 960fps. It’s seamless and a lot of fun to share online. Other differentiating features on this model include adaptive focus tracking/10fps burst mode, and 3D scanning. The focus tracking keeps a moving subject like a child in focus over the course of a ten-shot burst. It works really nicely. 3D scanning allows you to pan around a person or an object and scan it in 3D - meaning, you will end up with a computerized image you can turn in any direction, like a video game 3D model. In fact, Sony will be integrating these scans with its various PS4 properties, as well as offering you a 3D printing service to create a bust of your favorite someone. It’s really pretty cool, though probably not much more than a novelty, and it is pretty difficult to get a good looking scan. The slow-mo and burst modes are far more useful with currently available use cases. I've included some snaps from the camera and slow motion video. Check the comments for an imgur link to full-size images and a link to better quality video. PERFORMANCE The XZ1 is powered by a Snapdragon 835 CPU and has 4gb of RAM. 64gb of storage is onboard (expandable via micro SD up to 256gb), with about 10gb used for system software – Android Oreo. Suffice it to say, this is the CPU that powers every flagship, and it is completely and totally smooth and fast here. I could not get the phone to lag or stutter at all, no matter what I did. Games, camera, 3D scanning, everything. Sony’s skin of Android is really minimal, with only a few additional Sony apps included, along with Facebook, Netflix and Amazon. Sony’s apps tend to duplicate Google’s, but a few of them are really good, like the Album app that sorts photos. OVERALL VALUE AND CONCLUSION This is an expensive phone. Now, Sony’s phones tend to drop in price pretty quickly, perhaps because they keep releasing them on a 6 month schedule. But the price puts it in competition with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Google Pixel. So does it justify that price? The XZ1 performs as well as those flagships and has similar if not better battery life. Design-wise it is quite nice looking, though it doesn’t feature the trendy bezel-less look. The camera performs at around the same level as those flagships. It does a few things those phones’ cameras can’t, like 960fps slow-motion and 3D scanning. Its waterproofing is as good or better than most competitors. The US model has a disabled fingerprint scanner, which is a real bummer. I think this phone should be retailing for maybe $50-100 less than it is (which, based on past history, it will within 3-6 months). That would make it attractive enough to break through and overcome Sony's lack of carrier relationships. At its current price, it’s a very good phone with cutting edge specs that doesn’t differentiate itself all that much, and is missing one key element (the fingerprint scanner). For a Sony fan, this is a slam dunk. It’s a beautiful piece of hardware that performs with no compromises and justifies its price tag. For an Android fan, this is one of the first phones shipping with 8.0 Oreo, and it competes well with other flagships. But you may want to wait for a deal to jump on it.",21,"Sony"

"2180","B074P62MW8",5,"false","The phone works fine. I got it for two primary reasons. The first was to use it for development and testing applications I build. The second was for the 3-D software. For the first reason it works as expected, but the 3-D software is nothing but annoying. It takes you through all these step by step training courses that are painful to get through. It is a fast phone, and the camera works great. I tried to find a case for it but there were none out yet. A few listed as though they were for the phone, but the holes for the camera were not right. I will have to wait until I get a case to use it for anything other than a development tool at my desk. It is very thin, light, and easy to drop. I have already dropped it several times onto the carpet. Overall, I think the price may be a little high for what you are getting, but it is a really nice Android device.",1,"Sony"

"2182","B074P62MW8",5,"true","With the XZ1, Sony's Xperia line returns to form. After wandering in the cel phone wilderness for the last year or so, the electronics giant pulled their collective heads out of their collective hindquarters and have delivered a very good (if not quite great) flagship mobile device. The past 12-16 months gave us the X, the X Compact, the X Performance, the XZ, the XZS, the XA1, and a gaggle of other mid-tier offerings from Sony. Of them, only the XZS and the XZ Premium could come close to laying claim to flagship status, with the latter coming with one of the finest 4K displays in the business. Unfortunately XZS didn't come with a battery big enough to power the nice phone specs, and the XZ Premium was an exceptionally large phone, at an exceptionally large price. The XZ1 sees the company step up it's game. As of this writing, it's one of the few devices shipping with Android 8 / Oreo out of the box, running the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, with a beautiful 1080 display and a slightly-refined physical design and sturdy-feeling build-quality. And for nearly $700, it certainly should have a premium feel to it. Even the best phones are balancing acts of compromise, so while there's certainly something here for everyone, it's also unlikely to appeal to absolutely everyone. Most people either love or hate Sony's take on industrial design. Some bemoan the size of the top and bottom bezels. In a world where the S8 strives to give customers nothing-but-screen, Sony certainly isn't following the fashion train. But they sure as heck are following the functional-device-train. Having owned an S8, I certainly see the appeal. It's a beautiful looking device. But at the end of the day, I found the lack of bezels to be a problem in day to day use. With no edge on which to rest fingertips, I was constantly accidentally activating various apps, or accidentally hitting the wrong onscreen area within a given app. Nice to look at...but darn if it's not a pain to actually use. So, here's a subjective run down of Pros and Cons: PRO - Great screen. In addition to it's Triluminous setting, Sony has added a new video color-saturating setting. Honestly, it looks like they're taking a stab at the popping colors and deep blacks on OLED devices like the S8. And they've done a good job...this is one of the sharpest, most color popping screens out there at the moment. - Great processor. The new Snapdragon is great. Everything runs smoothly. - Headphone jack / Audio processing. Yay for hanging on to this bit of tech, the old headphone jack. Bluetooth headphones are well and good, but they eat up a battery, and they can't deliver the same quality of audio as a wired set. If how your music sounds on your device is important to you, wired is still the way to go. For now at least. And Sony's DESS audio processing sounds pretty great to my ears. Pick up a third party audio player like Neutron if you'd like even more control of the sound. CON - Physical design. This really doesn't belong in the ""con"" column, but the fact is either you like what Sony is doing here, or you don't. - Price. Sony offers a handful of budget models, but their flagship line has never been anything but pricey. Especially in America where the brand isn't known for it's mobile devices, the average android user might be hard pressed to pay $699 to a company they normally associate with televisions. In Europe and Asia, though, Sony remains a popular contender with Samsung and Apple for high end devices. - Battery. This also might not be a negative, as the new Snapdragon and Oreo are alleged to be more efficient with their power use. Running some benchmarks seem to bear this out, as while it leads in most areas, there are some processes they've scaled back. So far, I don't see any penalty in processing power, but I've also not had it long enough to take a firm stance on battery life. But anecdotally, it does seem to be an improvement over the XZS and XZ Performance.",46,"Sony"

"2200","B075QRTVNC",1,"true","I drive for a Rideshare company in California, where it's illegal to drive with a phone held up to your ear. This phone's Bluetooth has been buggy since day 1. I held on to it, because if I sent it back, I'd be literally unemployed until I got it repaired or replaced ...and also because I was hoping a software update would fix it. No such luck. I drive a Prius, and the 3 other phones I used to have, all worked fine in this car (even the 2 cheap lesser-known-brand ones) . So I know it's not the car that's the problem. Basically, when I first get into my car, everything works fine. But after 1 or 2 calls, it simply stops working. I'll pick up the line, and neither one of us can hear anything for one call. After that, it switches automatically to a ""regular"" connection, and I have to yank my phone off the dash and put it to my ear to hear them. Eventually this phone is going to get me a huge ticket, and I may even get fired if Uber sees that kind of ticket on my record. Not cool. Same with music. 1 or 2 songs, then the track information stops displaying on my car's touch screen. I'll, reach up and tap the play/pause button and it stops playing for a second, then immediately starts playing by itself again. Sometimes the car's play/pause and skip tracks buttons stop working altogether, too. Sony has been no help, and there's a lot of people in tech support forums all over the place having the same, or similar, problems with Sony phones. So, I'm fairly certain it's just a terrible design, rather than me just being unlucky, and getting a ""lemon"".

Until. Oh, until. Sony has a ""ghost touch"" problem that plagues this phone and others, I found out after I bought it. It seems unfixable. I can be going along, using my phone, and all of a sudden the screen goes crazy because it's registering clicks all over the screen. Or, when i put my finger on a spot, it registers that click clear across on the other side of the screen. It's absolutely maddening. Happens intermittently, and without reason. I've ""refreshed"" the phone, tried safe mode, used it without a case - and it persists. Most of the time shutting the screen off and turning it back on temporarily fixes it, but not always. And the problem comes back fairly quickly. It's maddening. I want to love this phone - but it's increasingly becoming unusable. UPDATE: I sent it in for warranty repair, and although I unlocked the bootloader they accepted it. They determined the ghost-touch was unfixable so they sent me a new one. So far, so good.

"2248","B077ZKKDWK",3,"true","I'll take my time to edit my review over the next few weeks as I get to use the phone. So let's begin! [Day 1] The phone came on time as expected without any issues. I originally ordered the blue one because it was $20 cheaper and delivery was one day sooner. My first choice was silver so Im glad that came by mistake. The phone is much bigger than my previous device which was the Galaxy S8. You wouldn't think those extra .5 inches makes any difference, but you'd be wrong. The phone looks and feels massive which is great if you're looking for a big screen. It's mostly made of metal with the back being a hard but sturdy plastic. You'd never be able to tell the difference when looking at it because it feels absolutely premium! It really makes you feel like you're holding an $800 phone when it's really only $350 which is an absolute steal! It was an absolute breeze to get started and get everything installed. Only thing that was a bit of a pain was finding the ability to disable/hide the battery percentage icon. You can do this by bringing down your notifications bar, going to the top right and holding down the gear icon. It will spin and unlock further options to play with. From there you can hide the percentage. I personally don't like watching my percentage go down so hiding this was a must for anxiety reasons. Calling into Metro-PCS and switching my sim card/Number was no problem at all. 10 mins, give them the IMEI number and you're set to go. Shouldn't take long at all. As soon as you put in the sim its already ready for you to play with! The phone comes with a pre-installed screen protector which surprised me. You can barely even see it unless you're looking for the edge of it on the top left side. Opening the app tray was a bit different than I'm currently used to with my S8. I would normally swipe up or down on the screen and it would open. Now that just comes up with a search and can only be found via the icon on the screen. I guess I'll get over it. The phone will also prompt you to update its software at least 6-7 times as you're playing with it. It gets a bit old after the 3rd time since it wants you to restart after each one. Not sure why they don't just have you updated to the latest one? I have yet to really 'use' this phone yet since it is day one so I couldn't give feedback on the call quality, speaker sound, or connectivity via LTE so I'll update as I continue to use it day by day. The phone feels snappy but coming from the S8 I'm not exactly impressed with the keyboard. It feels like the keys lag and make you feel like if you type too fast that your message with be messed up. Animations overall don't seem to be an issue. Everything is very quick and doesn't lag with opening apps or switching between them (for now). This is my first Sony phone, so I have my expectations set pretty high coming from a Samsung device. All I've had were Samsung phones, but I'm willing to get my toes wet with a different brand! I don't think the phone has quick charging because it took 2 hours to get from 50% to a full charge and I don't wanna break it with a fast charger. I guess it doesn't matter since Im always near a wall plug, but its nice to have that just in case I need some quick juice and top off my battery. So if anyone has tested this phone with a quick charge brick and had success, let me know! The charging cord is a bit on the short end but hasn't really become an issue for me yet. I guess only time will tell. Currently using an extension cord for my home office to keep it close to me. Overall, at least on day one I LOVE this phone! I've always wanted another big screen since my last 6+ inch screen was a Galaxy Max years ago. Only thing I hated about it was the lag and 720p screen, so this has been a treat for me with 1080p with a great battery with the LCD screen! If you're on the fence about whether or not you should spend the money, I would say buy this now! You will not regret the purchase. Just be prepared for its massive screen size because this is NOT a one-handed phone unless you're 7 feet tall. This phone is for those looking for more of a tablet experience with more screen real-estate. Great for movies, and youtube. Also, on a side note, finding a belt clip case for this phone is pretty much impossible unless you're okay with just a pouch to slide it into. I've looked all over Amazon and other sites. They just don't exist. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Day 3] After 3 days of use, I must say this is one of the best phones Ive ever used! It's so nice and truly feels and acts like a premium flagship device. The battery life is amazing. I took it off the charger at around 2 pm and it was only at 67% by the next day around 1 am. I could have easily squeezed out another 5-6 hours if needed with light usage. I have yet to really do any kind of gaming on this phone to really give you an idea of performance, but I will update this as I feel needed to keep you informed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ [Day 8] After a full week +1 day I've noticed even after taking the screen protector off that the auto-correction feature sometimes doesn't allow you to type certain letters. Most common letters being the 'r' in 'never' and the 'f' in 'for'. Its very strange. The problem keeps happening with and without the number row active. Its even worse with it off. I end up having to push letters 3-4 times before the keyboard allows me to type it. Its like the phone only wants to type correctly and will not allow you to make typos for any reason. If the problem keeps happening, I may end up returning it and getting a different phone. Im not sure if there is a fix for this that would enable auto correct with the added ability to overwrite typos purposely. As of right now, this 'feature' may end up being a deal breaker since it makes me very frustrated to have to push letters 4-5 times before the phone allows me to input letters. I really wanted to believe it was the lack of sensitivity with the added screen protector, but seeing how it made zero difference with it removed, kinda pisses me off. [Day 9] After the 9th day of fair use I've decided to get a different phone and refund this one. After looking into the keyboard issue it seems to be a common problem with others. So that is now the deal breaker for me. If it wasn't for the touch screen and keyboard issues, I would have kept the phone. So, who is this phone for you may be asking?: This phone is for those who are looking for a ""Flagship"" phone without the flagship pricing. It's for those who want a big screen but not a big price tag. It's a great phone if you can manage to get one without screen issues. I've also noticed the phone started lagging on day 7. At first, I ignored it because I said to myself ""Its nothing, its what a $350 phone does"", but seeing how it has 4 gigs of ram like my Galaxy S8 does, I found this to be unacceptable. As mentioned above, the battery life is amazing and would recommend to anyone wanting/needing a phone that will easily last you all day and then extra. I hope I've helped you decide if this phone is right for you. Figure out what you want, need and what you're willing to put up with. Don't expect it to be something it isn't!",3,"Sony"

"2252","B077ZKKDWK",5,"true","I am impressed with this phone, for it is very well manufactured, has a great detail, and appears expensive. The screen is beautiful once you get to set up the display and its color gamut in the settings. The sound is awesome, and the microphone works perfectly, for I no longer have to have people ask me to repeat what I have previously said. The first main feature of this phone is its camera, and it definitely takes good photos. While other phones have good cameras, in reality, it is the software the allows the pictures to come out looking nicely. With other phones, when you transfer your photos onto a computer, they do not look quite as good. With Xperia, however, the pictures look amazing, the the detail sure beats some of the major phones I have recently used. I will not go back to iPhone or Samsung after this guy. After all, Sony provides numerous other phone makers with their camera setup, so I am pleased with the pictures and the quality. The second important aspect of this phone is its battery. I have had this guy for about 6 months. I try to charge my battery up to 92-98%. I almost never let it go to 100%. What I have noticed in comparison to other phones, is that I can get 4 days out of one charge when doing phone calls, using Bluetooth, texting, taking photos, etc. The battery lasts no matter how much you force it to be used. The only thing that may drain it quickly is having the location turned on and having the screen brighter than it should be. The stamina mode is also very impressive, so anyone can be happy with this phone. In my opinion, it has already outperformed iPhone and Samsung just due to a better battery. On a final note, I was able to buy two of these phones, and I still had paid less than the price of one phone made by iPhone or Samsung. I appreciate Sony for not asking too much for high quality and durability.",1,"Sony"
"2253","B077ZKKDWK",5,"true","Sony what can I say. I read good reviews about this phone. Mayor complain was the size. The size is great and I have seen phones at about the same size. The fingerprint location is the best, You can add you 2 index fingers so no matter which hand you use, you can always unlock your phone. The camera improved a lot from my previous Sony Xperia. Takes decent pictures even in darker environments. The sound is good but for a Sony device it could improve. I would love to have more control over the sound output, but it is not bad. Battery life is great. I do not use my phone all day so i could get up to 2.5 days without charging. The graphics in the phone are excellent, I could just stare at the background just admiring how great it is. The keyboard is a great size, I have a medium size hand and have had difficulty typing on smaller phones before, with this one no issues. The price for a Sony phone is unbelievable, no great phone can be found at that price in any cellphone company. I am happy with my purchase. I am comparing this phone with a One Plus 5 and a Sony Xperia Z3 ( which I am still using as a BYOD at my job.",1,"Sony"
"2254","B077ZKKDWK",5,"true","Like many others (mostly Americans), we typically gravitate to Samsung or Apple branded cell phones, sometimes LG. I've had many Apple iphones and plenty of Samsung note# and S# phones, and they were all good phones. My last cell phone was a Samsung note 5 and it served its purpose but after i dropped it and the screen cracked for the second time, with a protective case around it and a screen protector, I refuse to pay another $200+ to fix the screen, so it was time to move on to something new and different. That lead me to venture out and explore other cell phone brands, and this Sony Xperia XA2 ultra caught my attention. After 3 weeks of use, Im extremely happy, and here are my thoughts on this phone..... Pros 1. Screen size/bezel. The 6 inch screen is great for playing games, surfing the web and watching videos. Some people prefer phone without the bezels but the small top and bottom bezels don't bother me. 2. Phone size, weight - I prefer bigger phones due to my above-average hand size, therefore this phone was a great fit for me. The weight of the phone is 7.8oz, which is above average in weight in the cell phone market and its the heaviest phone Ive ever owned but its not anything I cant get use to. 3. Battery Life - Wow!!! With normal use (texting, a few phones calls, 1-2 hours Youtube videos, a few games) this phone lasted me a full day and part of the next day on a full 100% charge and I still had 15% left. Great job Sony!!! 4. Security - The Rear Mounted fingerprint scanner is very convenient!! 5. Camera - Sorry ladies and gents, I'm not a camera-maniac. Some can/will argue but in my opinion, anything over 16-megapixels is pretty good for a cell phone, and this phone's main camera is 23mp, and selfie camera is 16mp, and it works for me!!! Most camera's on cell phones nowadays are pretty damn sharp!! 6. Processor - Snapdragn 630 isnt the lastest Qualcomm chip but its still considered a powerful processor. Overall, Im very happy with my Sony Xperia XA2 purchase. Sony has my attention in the cell phone market...",NA,"Sony"

"2264","B077ZKKDWK",4,"true","Updated review: After not using it for a couple of months, I turned it on because it had my emergency SIM I use when I travel out of T-Mobile range. It loaded a ton of updates, and apparently finally fixed the USB Android auto. I really like it now. The Android Auto issue was the only problem I had with it. Everything else about it works great. A great camera, and it has a shutter button so you don't have to tap the screen. The battery last forever. The display is crisp. One star off for taking so long to fix the problem. The support people are very uninterested in fixing this problem. I got an update sometime in May/June, and it has not worked right since. Android Auto works good for a few minutes and then it locks up. I bought a $180 ASUS phone and it works great all the time. This is clearly a Sony issue. A forum search will show this is a well known problem. An otherwise excellent phone I wish I could use, it has a great camera, nice big display and is quick on most tasks.

It will cost $200 me to have Sony fix the issue (tired a software fix to no avail). We are very disappointed as we would expect a quality product from a good brand not to break so easily. It is common for phones to fall or be dropped from relatively short distances and be fine - happens all the time with my other phones.

The numbers on the dialing pad are immediately adjacent to each other, unlike, for example, on an iPhone where the numbers are spaced well apart and each one is clearly separate. I thus find myself inadvertently misdialing if I dial too fast. I am not sure if this problem is me or the phone but in any event this one apparent flaw for one of the major uses of a phone, namely dialing a number, prevents a five-star rating. In addition, it does not appear that you can delete a number that you are dialing, for example, if you accidentally press ""2"" when you wanted to press ""3"" there seems to be no way to delete ""2"" and then go on to dial ""3"" but instead you have to end the process and go back and start dialing all over again.

"2334","B077ZKKDWK",4,"true","I've been playing with the phone for a couple of days now and I'm extremely pleased with it. I'm coming from a 5 year old Samsung Note II that was starting to struggle with web surfing and was becoming generally sluggish. I was initially going with a oneplus 6, which is arguably a better value for what you get, but the Xperia had 3 things going for it. 1) 6"" screen with 16:9 ratio, great battery life, and a price below $400. Considering that no phones support removable batteries anymore, a user would be fortunate to get 3 years from a modern phone. Paying $800+ for something that will expire in 36 months is just too much to ask. I was apprehensive about several things. 1) Moving from an Amoled to an IPS screen, 2) the fact that the cpu was a little dated, and 3) the camera which got lack luster reviews. My biggest surprise was that I couldn't distinguish any difference between the Amoled of the Samsung and the IPS of the Sony. Maybe the faintest dimming of the colours on the IPS when looking almost parallel to the screen was visible. The performance is smooth as butter and apps open quickly and the Chrome browser is very responsive. For now the 630 Snapdragon is doing a wonderful job on everything. The camera may not be on par with the Pixel or the Galaxy line, but it's better than my old Samsung, so I'm satisfied. Battery life has been phenomenal. Build quality is great. Reviewers mention that the body is plastic, but it is still of a high quality. Only caveats are the size of the phone combined with it's shape and the materials make it rather slippy. I'll be getting a slim case soon. Lastly, the weight of the phone does tire the hands when typing long emails and I find myself laying the phone on my lap or desk during a flurry of emails.",2,"Sony"

"2350","B077ZKKDWK",2,"true","FYI, I have purchased TWO of these phones and they both have the same problem. One from a third party seller BREED and one from Amazon directly. BOTH have the same audio problem. I have found no solutions to this and I can't help but wonder if everyone's' phone does this and no one cares? I'm just not sure. On both phones, I would play music I've played on various other phones including budget ones like a Huawei P20 Lite, and there's distortion in the music. In quieter music passages, especially those with quiet strings or piano, there is an unbelievably annoying electronic noise that I can hear over the music during these passages. I would describe it as an electronic buzz and/or a click that manifests itself with each note of music, and each time music stops and starts again. It happens when over 50% volume as soon as there's even an ounce of bass. I was able to make it stop by turning ClearBass ALL THE WAY DOWN, but that sort of defeats the point, doesn't it? It also happens on the speaker and over bluetooth, so there's something very wrong. This isn't the quiet hiss that I've heard of in some forums. It isn't a problem with call quality, etc. This is music playback, over WIRED headphones, with very high end cans. Audio playback using wired headphones is supposed to be superb, especially with a 24-bit 192khz DAC handilng the audio, so what happened??? Again, other phones from Huawei, Samsung, Xaiomi, and LG don't do this. They all sound fine. Anyway, I've poured over online forums trying to find someone else with this problem, and I can't find a thing. I know I'm not imagining it because the Huawei P20 Lite I have doesn't make the same distortion - in fact, it's very clear, just not that loud. The display, camera, and software on this phone are phenomenal for this price point. I was planning on keeping it until it wore out, but with this audio distortion, I've had to return both of the models I bought. I am so disappointed. I wanted so much to like this phone. Why, Sony? This was going to be my perfect budget phone. It makes me so sad I want to cry. :'-( Back to Huawei and Honor I guess....",3,"Sony"

"2352","B077ZKKDWK",3,"true","I had the xperia z3v for like 4 years before I decided to buy a new phone because the battery was completely done. I really REALLY loved the phone in the beginning. And I still do now 9 months later but I am considering buying a new phone because a few months back I started having a ghost touch screen issue. It was minimal at first but now it feels like it's all the time. Which is irritating as it starts opening the notification bar constantly, clicking on things its not supposed to or video calling people if im in Facebook messenger. Sometimes it stops after a few seconds but I find myself having to lock and unlock my phone just to use the touch screen all the time. To make matters worse the phones getting a little sluggish so sometimes if I have to lock and unlock it used to be convenient to use the finger print scanner but now it feels like its faster to just type in my passcode. Sometimes it takes at least 30 seconds to unlock with the finger print scanner after it vibrates that it read my finger print. Others have complained about the ghost touch screen for years now. I never had that issue with my last sony phone and its not tied to this phone especially. Some say it was after an update. I couldn't tell you if mine started after an update but it definitely got worse after the most recent update. Outside of that the phones great. Cameras great. Battery life is absolutely amazing. Another con is that I specifically bought a large micro SD to store apps and save phone memory only to find that the disabled that function to move apps to SD on the xa2. So that was irritating but I've learned to live with it. I still love my phone but the touch screen is so aggravating I'm looking into buying another phone. I'd hoped to have this one as long as my last but with the touch screen issue I don't think that'll happen which is really disappointing since I'm iffy about the newest sony phones. All and all buy at your own risk. You may not have the touch screen issue but if you do it will be very very annoying.",2,"Sony"
"2353","B077ZKKDWK",4,"true","I really like this phone. It has a large screen and excellent picture quality. I think the camera is very good for the most part. Could be better in low light but in the sun or a fully lit room it produces some of the better pictures I've seen on a camera phone. Battery life is fantastic. I have yet to NEED to recharge it before the end of the day with what I consider fairly heavy use. The sound is good but can have a ""mono"" quality since it comes from one speaker on the bottom. The real downside is the internal memory. There isn't much left after the OS stuff. After about 6 months I'm already running out of space. It's not a huge problem I just don't keep a lot of apps on the phone that I don't really use. Overall it's a great phone especially for the price. Glad I purchased. It proved a nice alternative to a flagship phone that would have cost twice as much.",4,"Sony"

"2356","B077ZKKDWK",5,"true","I've been using this phone for about two weeks now, very happy with it so far. Some reviewers complained about processor speed, but I had been using a three year old Huawei and this thing seems lightning fast to me, I'm certainly not complaining. In spite of the big screen the battery doesn't drain as fast as I expected, I've gone 48 hours between charges. Granted, I don't play cell phone games much which probably helps. Camera, has trouble with low light but actually better than other phones I've had, and in a decent light level pictures look great. There's also a little camera button on the side of the phone, so that you can turn it to landscape mode and use the button like it's a traditional camera, which is kinda neat. Cons: the only way to disable the ringer in this version of android is by turning on do not disturb, which is fine, just different. Also, this thing is a ""phablet"" so it's... pretty big. Only just barely fits in my jacket pocket and can be kind of awkward for smaller hands. A popsocket would be a good idea.",1,"Sony"

Sony support has done nothing but send me links on how to reset, update, software repair and so on. Sony’s own forums are full of people experiencing the same issue and those that have sent their phone in report it is unchanged when they finally get it bact some two weeks later.

My biggest complaint about it is that it's not popular enough (yet?) to have a lot of available cases/screen protectors, and the ones I got were complete garbage -- obviously not about the phone itself, but I could see it being a concern for some customers. Overall, I would recommend this phone for someone who likes big, sturdy phones with LOTS of battery life (I left my charger at work over the weekend, used my phone as normal, and it didn't die until late Sunday) & doesn't care TOO much about picture quality (it's not bad, per se, but the camera can be a little slow to focus, which is kind of annoying when you're trying to photograph an eight-month old kitten).",1,"Sony"

When I first got the phone, everything was fine and in order, with the exception of a few hitches - a frozen screen every now and then, but I wasn't really using it because I hadn't connected to a service provider (AT&T in my case). Problems started as soon I got service on it. At first I thought it was the network, and AT&T probably isn't amazing in this area, but my friends and colleagues with AT&T were able to use their phones in the same places. What I mostly notice is that the phone struggles to connect to the cellular service and also doesn't connect well to the wifi. I have to be standing right next to the wifi router to get good service - while other devices (computer, other cell phones) are able to connect from a few more feet away. Calls, via cellular or internet, are constantly dropped... So while the phone might have decent features (decent camera - though bad videos), it isn't able to do the basic things of a phone - which is make actual calls and texting. The phone also freezes during phone calls and it won't allow me to hang up the phone (been a little awkward sometimes). The phone also has no memory storage. Once all my apps were loaded on it, the phone said it was 80% full. I went on one trip for a week, taking a bunch of photos and the phone's storage was completely filled from it.

"2364","B077ZKKDWK",2,"true","Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  I purchased my XA 2 Ultra back in February and it worked great for a month. The problem with these phones and a major problem is the screen sensitivity getting so bad that just moving a finger above the screen will cause the screen to jump around and flicker. The pull-down menu on top constantly comes down when trying to touch anything towards the top of the screen. I've asked in Sony tech forums about solutions to fix this phone and there is really nothing you can do, no calibration tools on the phone and was told I should mail the phone back to Sony. I just had an update from Sony on April 8 and it did not fix the problem and is why I'm writing this review. I've also removed the screen protector in hopes that would work but the constant flickering of the screen is just too much. Like I said.. I have restored the phone, I have used safe mode, I have tried without SIM or storage card, checked that glove mode is off, etc. Nothing has fixed this issue.

"2368","B077ZKKDWK",4,"true","First off, the SX XA2U is the first phone I've bought in 4 years and I'm glad I chose this model. It was between this, the Sony Xperia 10+ or the Galaxy S9+. In the end I just wanted cheaper and affordable but with at least some decent features that can almost keep up with the flagship phones - - even though it seems this phone got a resounding ""meh"" from a lot of critics on release. I think it's a shame but some devices won't take off till the next iteration at times. But given that this phone has dropped in price since 2018, I think it's now a good affordable device for people who just like having a practical mobile but with a bit more bite under the hood to run your favorite media, than say, the lower end phones. I would say however to stick with the XA2 if you don't really care for the extra bells and whistles of the XA2U. You won't be sacrificing too much in exchange for a better price. Like the size for instance, a lot of reviews think the XA2U is too weighty and bulky. I love it in my case, and I have small hands. Maybe it's just me, but I got used to the bulky ZTE Max Duo LTE that had a case too. So some people used to a big phone like that shouldn't see much difference. In fact the XA2U is slightly smaller than the Max Duo. So my fingers got some relief without sacrificing too much screen space. The design is a clean cut professional look (got it in silver which I think looks sharp). Nice shiny metallic looking borders, with aluminum sides. The screen has plenty of space but I will say I often do find myself accidentally hitting the edges from such small borders. Takes some getting used to. As far as navigation, the touches are touchy and swiping is swipey just as it should be. Apps and windows load and slide with ease. Having had the same for phone for 4 years, it was showing its age badly. So it was nice having some smoothing loading and transitioning again.",NA,"Sony"

Only thing I had to do was enter my contact list again (minor inconvenience). The Internet is awesome on this thing, especially once you get used to the settings and moving apps about. Most of all, the best thing about this phone is the media... 5 stars for a dynamic well lit screen coming in at 6 inches, sturdy, an AMAZING YouTube or similar movie-playing experience.

I'm eager to do a full battery test on the device. when I first turned it on I got really excited and the colors that it displays are amazing. I popped in my sim from my Xperia z3 and it started working right away with the xa2 ultra. Nice little upgrade. I love that it also has android Oreo 8.0 already ready to go.

I was diehard iPhone before and about to buy an iPhone X but I couldn't bring myself to spend $1000+ for a new phone (iPhone or Samsung) . A friend showed me their Chinese phone, Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, and it was impressive.. Dual SIM, upgradable storage.. This Xperia was listed as a similar model and decided to go with it since it was a name brand I knew and around the same price.. I've had it 2 weeks now and absolutely love it so far. Will update later. Upgradable storage.. Came with 32 GB hard drive and installed a 256 micro SD card... Massive screen... Very bright bright and clear.. The photos and camera functions aren't as good as iPhone or Samsung... But the photos are still pretty good.. Back of it is plastic, but you're gonna put a case on it anyway, so who cares... The phone is heavy and feels great.. Doesn't feel like a cheap made phone.. Battery life is amazing... I fully charged after receiving it and played around on it non-stop for 6 hours and still had 35-40% battery even with the massive screen... Functionality is awesome. No delays.. No crashes.. All Android based (Android 8.0.0)... The more I use it, the more I'm thinking I'll never get another iPhone.. I feel so free from Apple now.. Less Hassel and restrictions..

I ordered a replacement but it didn't quite match but I had already damaged my old battery 😑 Anyways I then sought after the Sony Xperia phones, I've always been kind of interested in them btw, and purchased one. If you're familiar with the Nokia 1320, the Xperia XA2 Ultra is just about the same size as that but sleeker and smarter. It has great sound and picture quality. I'm really not a fan of watching movies and playing games via phone but I wouldn't mind doing either from this phone because it won't disappoint. My family even loves it! The feature that I love the most is the fingerprint pass code which allows you to unlock your phone with just a touch of your finger. I have yet to find out about and use all of the phone's features because I recently purchased it; but I am eager to figure it all out and read more of the instructions 😊.

"2390","B077ZKKDWK",5,"false","I have had an LG v10 and have loved the second screen but it was starting to show its time. Forget those $800 phones, this phone is as functional day to day as much as stylish. I went to Best Buy to take a peek at the phone and to see if I liked the style. It has a metallic edge loop on both sides and a solid feel, which gives a premium and expensive feel. After buying it, the screen has a great clarity; it is not too cold or cheap with tiny pixels showing. You can even adjust it through Sony settings to warmer color settings. The best thing that Sony finally did is give us a 3500 battery. I am on a second day and the phone is down to 54%. That is beyond amazing as my last phone would die through the night. According to the specs, Sony uses a technology that avoids battery damage and deterioration through repeated phone charging. Here are other Information I can give having it: Call Quality: The calls that I made (T-Mobile) are great. The caller can hear me well as can I. The only issue is that calls are NOT routed through T-Mobile's network for HD quality. However, if the other caller does not also have that functionality ( land lines, VOIP, etc) it doesn't matter much then. Camera: The camera is excellent with its ""hybrid"" (their word) focus; it can zoom and predict moving objects very well ( took it to the beach this weekend). The front camera is even better as it has a flashlight for night or dark selfies and the stabilization is very good when video recording. The 4K however is not much good, which is understandable as this is not a flagship phone. Feel and Quality: The phone feels sturdy. You will definitely not need to check your pockets if you left your phone somewhere as it will let you know. The finish is premium and the plastic does not catch any fingerprints (I prefer it to those glossy phones that look like war zones after uses). I experienced no lag and battery crash using heavy slurping apps such as games and social apps. You can use the available Stamina mode to take it further. Security: I read somewhere that Sony has started to push security patches more quickly and efficiently than other manufacturers. Nowadays, that's as good as having a good antivirus on computer. I also like the fact that they provide a summary of what the software update includes instead of just harassing you to just install something like other manufacturers do. And lastly, Freebies in the box (earphones for me)!! The phone charger is not a fast one so just buy a good one from Anker or Ravpower.",18,"Sony"
"2391","B077ZKKDWK",1,"false","This phone, like its predecessor, will develop digitizer issues making the top inch of the screen impossible to touch.

"2392","B077ZKKDWK",1,"false","I was on vacation in Mexico when my old phone broke, so I went to one of the flagship stores of the national Mexican carrier TelCel and bought an Xperia A2. Within two weeks the touch screen stopped functioning properly. Despite the fact that they have a partnership with TelCel and that the phone was bought brand new in the box, Sony told me that the warranty was not valid because I had taken the phone back to the USA, that there was no ""international"" warranty. Don't buy a Sony phone. EDIT: After much complaining Sony relented and agreed to fix my phone. After one month of waiting the phone was returned to me with the same problem, although I had been VERY clear exactly what the problem was. I called Sony again and was told to send the phone back. From the time I first contacted Sony to the time I finally had a working phone was almost three months. I did appreciate eventually being able to get my case noticed by people in the company who had the ability to fix the problem, but Sony has a long way to go to get their customer service system fixed. First of all, if you are selling an international product through your international partners, then stand behind your products after you sell them. Don't make the customer go begging for help after they've been sold a defective product. Secondly, when the customer takes the time to explain the defect in great details, don't ignore that information and send the product back just because the normal tests did not detect a problem. If Sony technicians simply would have read the detailed note I included with the phone then they would have quickly realized that yes the problem did really exist, and I would not have had to wait a THIRD month to get my phone back.",4,"Sony"
"2393","B077ZKKDWK",1,"false","I thought the Xperia series would be good based on youtube reviews I saw, But If you ever need support or try to make a warranty claim, you will quickly find out how horrible it is. No wonder Sony's mobile phone market is doing bad compared to other brands. The phone I received had multiple audio problems from the first time I used it which was unfortunately 2 months after purchasing. It also wouldn't receive attached images from some senders via MMS (works fine with any other brand with same SIM), The phone would also shutdown if vehicle turned off while it's charging (even at 80% charged). Oh and if your hand or cheek happens to block the back of the phone, it kills your signal and audio. Too many defects for a phone that was brand new. I couldn't return the device and my only option was to file a warranty claim which was a hassle and had to waste lots of time with poor speaking ""customer service"" people who give the run around and have you do multiple emails and prove to them that its still under warranty. Then if you send it (which by the way goes to some 3rd party repair center), they will not take a look at it or fix it if you have any cosmetic issues. They use that as a loophole to not have to warranty the device. I would definitely stayaway from Sony unless you don't mind dealing with problems and can afford to replace your phone whenever a manufacturing defect presents itself!",3,"Sony"

Sound is clear and loud but is easily covered by your hand when playing games for example. Over all I like the phone and would recommend it if you are looking for a good phone but don't prioritize the camera.",6,"Sony"
"2396","B077ZKKDWK",5,"false","Let me start off by saying I bought this phone coming from a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. That phone is light and thin, this phone isn't, and I love it. First, this phone is huge, 6"" is more than enough for viewing any kind of media. The 1080p screen looks great for watching YouTube. This phone is pretty hefty too, trying to pick up my S7 felt weird, but having a bigger overall form factor makes this phone easy to hold, the power button and volume rocker are easy to reach with just a little adjusting. Battery life is phenomenal, I forgot to plug it in one night after a day of use and woke up with 67%, which would have been enough to last me that day too. The battery care feature ensures that your battery stays healthy, keeping the phone at 90% until it thinks you'll wake up, you don't even have to configure anything, it just does it automatically once it learns your habits. The camera is just as competent as I would expect. I could get a little closer with my S7 and stay in focus, but the pictures that I take normally look just as good. The audio experience both surprised me and disappointed me. For starters, the built in speaker is absolutely astonishing. I can play music at full volume with no distortion and can hear it throughout my house. Having a built in FM receiver is a great little addition that has been nice to have before. The area I was disappointed in was audio options. My S7 had a full equalizer that could be adjusted, the XA2 only has simple upscaling and clear audio options, a little disappointing, but considering I can forget about it, it's not a deal breaker. After having this phone for a little over a month I can say this is the best phone I've ever seen for under $500. UPDATE 04/16/2019 My Xperia recently updated to Android 9.0, and this phone has gotten even better. The things mentioned previously still apply. Battery life is still great, the screen is nice and crisp, and the audio still sounds great. The Pie upgrade brought some quality of life changes that I'm glad came over. You can now connect a bluetooth speaker and still play audio through the phone speaker. This was actually quite a useful feature on my S7, as I often didn't want to take calls through a speaker sitting on the other side of the room. I put up with it while I had Android 8.0, but now that the feature is back I use it quite often. Somehow, this update freed up some storage space on my phone. I'm not sure if it was the actual update or the built-in storage manager, but after I updated I gained 3.0GB of storage back(12GB up from 9.0GB). Ever since Google stopped letting you transfer app data to SD cards, this was a blessing. I do think 32GB is a bit on the smaller side, whenever I upgrade next I'll likely get at least 64GB of internal storage, apps like Snapchat and Reddit are larger than they seem. Overall this phone was great and is even better now, if you're in the market for a new mid-range phone I would highly suggest this phone or its little brother, the XA2.",2,"Sony"

"2398","B077ZKKDWK",5,"false","So far, I've been very happy with this phone. It's a little larger than some phones, but it's still easy to hold and fits well in the phone pocket of my purse. I have accidentally put my call on mute when trying to talk without holding it. Although it's only a little longer than my old phone, the screen size is extra large and the graphics are sharp which makes it great for browsing the internet or watching a video. To maximize the screen size, the button to wake the screen is on the side, and I'm still getting used to that. For detailed information about the phone, you have to refer to a website, but a small pamphlet is included that gives you the basics like how to find the power off/on button. Luckily, it was easy to figure out the basics like adding my own wallpaper photo and customizing the ring tones and notification sounds for my important contacts, as well as set up a directory and/or shortcuts to frequent contacts. The camera works well and I'm happy with the pictures I've taken using the phone and the quality is good when I've posted the photos or sent via text. The sound quality is good and I've had no problems hearing anyone when using the phone.The microphone might be super-sensitive though, because some people I've talked to have said they can hear background noise, almost like I had the call on speakerphone. I'm especially happy with the battery life. I used it for two days for texting, calling, and accessing the internet and at the end of the second day, it was still at 73%. I assume since this is a brand new type of phone, there wasn't a huge choice of phone cases or screen protectors for the phone, but I was able to find something I like.

"2406","B077ZKKDWK",5,"false","This Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra is a solid piece of equipment, figuratively and literally. The phone weighs in at 7.8 oz, and is fairly large in my smaller hands. Despite the negative of not fitting in many of my regular pockets, the bright beautiful and large 6"" screen with vivid visuals is definitely worth it. The screen use area goes all the way to it's smooth and rounded side edges in a nearly infinity-type bezel free view, and even though the infinity effect applies only to the sides of the screen (the top and bottom still have fairly deep framing), I'm not noticing the tops and bottom as much in daily use. My finger movements are also captured in a very responsive manner, quickly and accurately. I've used several brands of mobile phones over the years, and this Sony was very intuitive to me- perhaps this is because smartphones have become somewhat standard in style and basic function over time. But, I thought this Sony was actually easier to set up than several of the big name brands I've owned in the past. Also, the camera is very good- the dual selfie cameras in front for wider capture, and high resolution (23 megapix back/ 16 and 8 megapix front) really makes this phone shine, esp. if you take a lot of photos like i do. Also, the battery life is exceptional, imo, and i did not have to recharge until day 3 with my normal use, including checking my live streaming home security cameras frequently throughout the day and watching utube videos. One issue I encountered was that when I first turned on the phone, it was all in Chinese, and I can't read Chinese, so I found this online if you encounter a similar issue: If you can't read the menu texts, find and tap the System gears pic, the keyboard pic and the first entry at top. Then add and/ or drag and drop the language you want to the top. All together, with the great features, good visuals, exceptional battery life and ease of use, and mostly the very competitive price for a higher end smart phone, I'd highly recommend this Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra unlocked.",6,"Sony"

They have similar storage options. Where the HTC 10 drops the ball, the XA2 slam dunks it. I am currently enjoying all the massive screen real estate. I am enjoying the wired headphone set up as well the LDAC support via Oreo and Sony's amazing Bluetooth profiles. The bootloader is unlockable and Sony supports it via Sony’s Open Devices program. You can get your hack on and still keep an amazing device from bricking. Battery life is phenomenal. The screen quality is stellar. Speed is zippy.

You have one speaker on the bottom and it blares and sounds washed out if you put it on high. But I use headphones, so not a big concern. It has the type c charger which is nice. And battery lasts a very long time. I'm a heavy user of social media, ebooks, and watching netflix/hulu/prime. Definitely only charging once a day now compared to twice on my Samsung s7. The screen is amazing and nicely lit outdoors. Flashlight is bright. Selfie flash is great. Games run great and look great. Bloat ware is minimum, which is awesome.

Text and images appear large and clear, and the phone feels solid in my hand. The zippy connection speed is great, it has an excellent battery life and does a fast charge, three features that are critical in my choice of phones. Basic set-up and operation were intuitive. 32 GB of RAM is generous and I can load all the photos and apps I need. One of my favorite things about this Xperia (and as you can see, there are many) is that the phone is “unlocked”. For those who aren’t familiar with this feature, cell phones come either unlocked or locked. Manufacturers don’t lock their phones, carriers do and use specific software to lock them to insure you are tied into their contract. An unlocked phone is not tied to one specific carrier, and can be used on a variety of different networks. By having an unlocked phone, you are free to shop around for the best price. However, not all carriers accept the Xperia X2A Ultra—so this needs to be confirmed before going forward with a carrier. So far I have only found a few downsides, none of which were deal breakers: 1. Being a bit bigger than most, it’s a little heavier than other phones. 2. Like most “phablets” (large phone/small tablets), the Xperia does not have a swappable battery, so you need to backup your contacts list and move important data to an external drive. 3. The fingerprint sensor is great, (very James Bond). However, given the importance of security these days, what is the possibility my fingerprint can be stored somewhere other than on the phone?",3,"Sony"

This particular model (3223) has zero developer support for 3rd party roms. Lack of updates beyond security updates exacerbates this issue. Before, if you had a phone that wasnt updated by the manufacturer and it was an open device, you could update your phone with third party software.

"2429","B077ZKKDWK",5,"false","After two plus years with my beloved LG V10 phone, it was finally time to move on to a new phone with some improved features. I had been considering this phone and the new LG V30, but decided I didn't want another carrier locked phone with all the bloat ware buried in it. Nor was I interested in a price tag upwards of six hundred dollars - new phones have gotten obscenely expensive. However, after two weeks of use, this Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra is a bargain for several reasons. The six inch screen is not only a pleasure to use, it's simply gorgeous. The clarity and colors are outstanding. Watching a true HD show on the phone is as pretty as watching it on out big TV. I use two hands to type or surf the web because I am using a flip case on the phone. I have literally tried five different screen protectors and none of them fit. The curved sides mean a glass protector just doesn't cover the entire screen - I had to resort to a wallet style case to provide a bit of cover over the screen. The camera is really a joy to use. It has an option for moving stills and super fast shutter for action shots - love this when I'm photographing the horses. The details on close ups are equally great - you can see every hair on our fluffed up Siamese cat. It only comes with 32gig of memory so you definitely need a beefy micro SD card if you take a ton of photos. I simply moved my 64gig card from my old phone and I was good to go. Everything transferred and populated the new phone. Because this is unlocked and I didn't owe anything on my old phone, I swapped my SIM card from the old phone to this one and was making/receiving calls and texts within minutes. We use AT&T and I had zero drama swapping my phones out. I've been very pleased with the battery life here. My old LG had a removable battery and I was changing batteries or recharging at least once a day. This Xperia has gone from 6 am to around 10pm every day for 6 days straight without needing to be charged. I do most of my email, make calls, text a ton, print stuff, use the Audible app for books and take multiple photos daily - I basically use my phone instead of a tablet or laptop most of the day. The last two nights when I've finally charged it at bedtime, the battery was at 52% and 48%. I don't worry about it going dead if I'm having an extra long day. Honestly, I've just fallen in love with this phone and I will never go back to a carrier locked phone in the future.",16,"Sony"

"2444","B077ZKKDWK",3,"false","""Excellent Hardware, however poor, annoying, intrusive Android User Inteface software."" This appiies to the Xperia XA2 Ultra model (January 2019) THE GOOD: Excellent hardware quality, great sound quality, crystal clear AMOLED display, OK battery life, THE BAD: * Lack of up to date documentation for this model (""Ultra"") on the Sony Web site. (The hardware specs are a bit different from the ""regular"" (non ultra) model. * In spite of a larger screen that my previous Android phones (I had several), this one is less readable: fonts (icons too) are way too small, so the benefit to have a great AMOLED is largely (well smally!) lost. Sony engineers should resist the temptation to fill the screen with lots of useless ""stuff"", to keep readability as good as possible. * It seems to be a bug, which often turns the flash-light on, and it is hard to turn off ! (Ideally pushing a side button would be better). * Battery life: in Spite of quite a large (3.8 a/h) it does not seen so great, and the charger provided does not seem to be a quick charge... and the documentation does not indicate if I can use a quickcharger... * I purchased this phone in a Bestbuy store, and though it was ""dual SIM"" model, the box should specify in large letter something like ""SONY XPERIA XA2 ULTRA SINGLE SIM MODEL"", (or DOUBLE SIM etc...) so customer knows what she.he is bying ! (There ia a ""$35 restocking fee"" at Bestbuy that I am not willing to pay, so I shall keep this one. THE UGLY: The User Interface is based on Android 8.x (Oreo), but 1) This phone comes with lots of very intrusive ""bloatware"", impossible to remove unless rooting the device, and the basic use (simply answering a call!) as a phone is so difficult that I could not get several calls, when (finally) on the phone switching from speaker to non speakerphone is NOT possible (not simply at least), bringing a commonly used application (like WhatApp, Hangout, etc..) to the simple destop, like it was on Andoid 7.x (Nougat) is not possible, or at least not simply possible. CONCLUSION: ""Sony corporate""if it wants this product to be sucessful, needs to provide an ""Android Classic"" version of this phone, ideally free of bloatware or at least where bloatware can be removed without rooting the device. Furthermore, the normal use of the phone should be an unmodified ""Android"" as delivered by Google, not because I love it, but because it is usable, simpler. (On simplicity, Apple i-phones still beat Android, but this is another story!) It theses software issues were correctly and promptly addressed, this phone could be a superb midrange priced phone, consequently could become a very sucessfull product. When / If that happens I shall update my ratings to a five stars. Note: I did not buy this phone to Amazon, perhaps should have, but my current Android phone being failing I needed quickly, and regular ""non prime"" Amazon for shipping is nabout one week: this was too long ! Thanks for the attention A.G",2,"Sony"
"2445","B077ZKKDWK",5,"false","This phone is exceptional. I purchased this phone in Mainland China for 2799 RMB from the Sony store and the promotion at that time was that they included in a free case which is normally an additional 199RMB. The version that is for sale in Mainland China is the dual sim card version with 64 GB. Decided to buy a Sony phone because every Sony product that I own exceeded my expectations and I have never had a problem with any of my Sony products. Purchased this and the after sales service installed the Hong Kong firmware for me which includes Google Play, Facebook, Amazon and all the other software that most non-Chinese people use on a regular basis. If you live in Mainland China, this is one of the best deals on the market. Phone is fast and everything works as it should. It is a large phone so I would look at this in person before purchasing it. Camera is excellent and I'm sure this is just as good, if not better, than anything in this price range. One of the few phones in the mid-range that has 4K video. I should add that this particular phone has several apps for photo editing that are included and these are very similar as to what you'd find on the famous Sony RX100 camera, which I also own. Screen is very bright and the battery is huge. Also I like the software that Sony has on its website to backup your phone's data directly to your computer. My last two phones, a Samsung and a Huawei, did not have such software and I found it to be a PITA if you wanted to try to backup your data on your computer. Last thing that I think is worth mentioning is that Sony phones have limited bloatware, which is one of the main reasons I purchased this. Since I live in China, most of the Chinese phones have TONS of apps that cannot be deleted and it is very difficult installing Google Play. If you don't want to spend 7-800 USD on a phone, you should strongly consider this.",2,"Sony"

"2448","B077ZKKDWK",5,"true","AT LAST a quality phone, one that's not made in China or Korea. The Xperia is the best phone I've ever used. I would've paid twice as much. The best thing about it is Sony's integrated experience, it is so much better than other androids I've tried, where something as simple as getting home screen icon overly notifications to work is a chore. Just the highlights: ~ Superb battery life! 30+ hours from 100%, Stamina mode adds another 5. ~Fantastic default keyboard layout and autospelling correct, unlike Apple's phony autocorrect that tries to embarrass you. ~Sony's 6"" screen is amazing! I love it!! Although it only runs at full HD, not 4K like the XZ, it is plenty sharp and beautifully bright and colorful. It is unmatched at this price point. Some say this phone is tablet-like, I disagree, it's not that big. In fact, as a fan of bigger screens, I wish it was a little bigger. It is the same exterior size as my iPhone 6+. It's a few millimeters taller and the 6+ is a few mms wider. In fact Sony's 6"" screen is the first Android I've used that matches the 6+ and older Galaxies, because those older phones' bottom bezel hardware buttons don't reduce the 5.5"" screen size to only 5"" of useable real estate. This phone has exactly 5.675"" of usable diagnal screen area NOT counting the software buttons, which are usually displayed. Because of this, the ingenius built-in one-handed operation screen reduction is really a bit too small; roughly iPhone 4-like. ~Luv the blackberry-like notification and charging light. The single LED lights up in an amazing number of different colors depending on what it is trying to tell you. ~Build quality is sensational, although the all metal chromed-out XZ Premium is even slicker. The phone is built in Japan, not in Chinese sweatshops like iPhone and Google's total garbage quality, or Samsungs made in Korea. ~Sony's Nikon DLSR experience really shines with a superb 23MP rear camera and two great front cameras. The dedicated shutter button makes the phone seem like you are using real camera hardware. It even has a halfpress shutter button function to lock focus on your intended subject, allowing you to then reframe the composition whike the focus and exposure remains locked. That feature alone is worth going Sony, and no reviewers even understand it. Advanced settings are unlocked with your fingerprint and are also very DSLR like, like predictive motioning tracking focus. ~FAST cpu and blazing general operation. FAST WiFi. FAST camera. FAST everything. ~Luv the pin wheel screen scroll and default widget selection. Sony's launcher is the first one I've been happy to use. Cons: ~I'm not a fan of edge to edge screens. It's nice bling but phones need a frame to hold on too. It's too hard NOT to touch the screen. ~Still getting used to having no bezel button(s). I prefer a front or side fingerprint sensor.

"2472","B077ZKKDWK",4,"true","The following will be a review for the US model of the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra (32GB, single SIM). Please note that this review was made after 2 weeks of use and may change upon incident thereafter. ________________________________________________________________________________________ Pros: *Industrial design is of traditional standard and does not appear cheap (i.e. metal). *Phone comes with screen protector already on screen (albeit cheap quality). *Phone comes with enough RAM (4GB) for typical end-user use-cases (i.e. calling/IM, social media, streaming). *Android 8 build is snappy and doesn't seem to perform out-of-touch. *Picture quality is greater than previous additions and on par with newer flagship models. Camera features are dispersed. *Initial Phone setup is intuitive and straightforward. *Android 8 is selectively more customizable than other Android implementations (by default) and offers enough options. *USB Type-C charging is notably faster than previous phones. *Phone comes with headphone jack. *Phone supports most recent mobile networks and WIFI network standards (i.e. speeds). *Phone comes with US 1-year limited warranty. *Phone comes with a generous amount of internal storage and allows for a lot more expandable capacity *Android comes with Swiftkey Keyboard as default keyboard *Speakers are of decent quality and can definitely be utilized for alarms *Android 8 comes with better security features by default *Phone fingerprint reader is in good spot relative to placement of hand/holding of phone Cons: *While battery lasts longer, it does not seem replaceable nor does it hold charge as long as it should on idle *While Android 8 on Xperia seems to work as it should, it comes with minimal extra features (such as widgets, exclusive app store, necessary apps) *Android comes with bloatware apps preinstalled (i.e. Amazon) but most can be opted out of during initial setup (i.e. Xperia) *Android 8 comes with minimal customization for select UI behaviors/configurations but misses on others (like lock-screen clock sizes, cannot invert core action buttons [back, home, window list]) *Android doesn't come with distinct Video app nor with useful widget for videos *Charging cable is rather short compared to previously owned USB/charging cables __________________________________________________________________________________________ Conclusion: In the end, and for the price I paid ($400 w/ tax), I think this will serve my purposes well. I'm not crazy about picture quality, sound quality, or gaming on my phone. I do like being able to run enough apps without drop in performance. What I do care about is customization of Android UI/behaviors/etc. I also prefer having de-facto, built-in apps/widgets that support the use of the phone. For example, my previous phone came with a system monitor app on its own. While I can technically retrieve the same information via other means within Android, it'd make more sense to simply ship an app that monitors RAM, STORAGE, DEVICE HEALTH all in one dashboard/view. Additionally, widgets need to be more in array as is with other vendors. The album app and files app work wonderfully but a definitive video app needs to be included alongside a widget. A home-grown app store would be nice to have, just as well. Preferably one which solely contains Sony-created apps. Again, this would require Sony to push out more apps on their Android builds and publish them. The battery performance for this phone is better than I expected but still comes up short when taking into consideration of idle-use. If I leave my phone by it's lonesome, it will still drain itself as if I had been using it. I don't keep apps open and I don't run unnecessary services on my phone (i.e. location, Bluetooth, etc.). I am looking forward to battery longevity when Android 9 comes out on this device for which it is evidently eligible for. All in all, this is not a budget phone but it is not a gaming phone either. This will get you what you need provided you know how to use a phone efficiently. Otherwise, you're always going to be SOL no matter what phone you use.",4,"Sony"

My kids have a Z3 and another Z5.

I also wanted high quality with a big battery and big screen. This was the best decision I made. As a heavy user, I had to charge my last phone (LG) 3 times in a day just to make it through to bed time. With this phone, when I get home from work, there is 75 percent left and I browse in the evening while at home and it is about 50 percent when I go to bed. Unheard of.

"2492","B077ZKKDWK",5,"false","The Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra Phone is a great new smartphone just released by Sony. It is factory unlocked. It is a rather large phone with an impressive HD 1080p 6"" edge to edge display screen covered with Gorilla Glass. It does make itself known as it weighs in at 7.8 ounces. It has three cameras, two front-facing cameras, one of which takes 120 degree super wide photos. Yea for the selfies! The main camera is rear-facing and takes all the usual photos and can make regular and slow-motion video recordings. It has excellent audio quality. It comes equipped with a large capacity battery that just seems to let the phone's charges last and last. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor platform, and its operating system is an Android Oreo 8.0. It has a fully functioning fingerprint sensor to unlock the phone. The list of goodies seems endless. I am coming off a dinosaur of a cell phone and this new model Sony Experia has really impressed me with its capabilities. I am slowing working my way through what it can do to make my life easier. I have been very pleased with the results so far and frankly, I expect to be able to launch a rocket to Mars soon. Well, maybe just to the Moon. I know that I have a lot to learn to reap the full benefits of this terrific device and it is a pleasure discovering each new task made easier while using it.",1,"Sony"

"2496","B077ZKKDWK",1,"true","The touch screen failed after 64 days. Sony's service is clueless and keeps telling me it can be fixed via software, yet their software fix hasn't worked after 3 tries. The problem is, I can't get them to even admit there is a problem so I can send it in for service. Since it was after 60 days Amazon won't help either. The bottom line is I won't be renewing my Amazon Prime membership (especially after the price increase) and I'll stick with companies like Costco that stand behind all of the electronics they sell. Had I bought this phone from them, I would have had a replacement by now, instead of nearly 1 month of TRYING to get it serviced under warranty unsuccessfully. As for when the phone functioned, it was ok. The lack of integrated wifi voice calling and texting was a huge hassle and the integration with Android Auto was pretty flaky, it would often crash the phone. The camera was below average, especially since with Sony's background in cameras. Really the main thing the camera had going for it was the physical shutter button allowed you to quickly open the camera app, but that isn't enough to overcome the rest of the below average camera package. The phone had good battery life and a nice and bright screen (although the colors were very cold/blue tinted). Android 8 is nice, but it still can let apps run wild in the background if you are not careful and I just don't trust Google anymore. If Sony won't fix it under warranty, I'll probably just smash it with a hammer. At least I'll get some satisfaction from wasting $400.",25,"Sony"
"2497","B077ZKKDWK",3,"true","I recently switched from a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra Factory Unlocked Phone, and use Tmobile (which I have been with for 11 years) as my service. I love the phone itself. The size, single action fingerprint unlock on the back, battery that easily lasts two days with my usage, low amount of bloat (especially compared to Samsung), ability to block notifications directly, and fast responsiveness from the OS and apps. Some people don’t like that it’s heavy and square-shaped, but I liked the shape and the weight didn’t bother me. It’s a phablet, so is to be expected. The phone as a device--other than calling--easily gets 5-stars from me. But here’s the problem: Calling. I had three major calling issues on T-Mobile: 1) The call quality is muddy/muffled. Apparently, the phone does not support VoLTE (voice over LTE). Which means it uses LTE for data like surfing the web, but switches to 3G or lower when on a call. As a result, the call quality is muddy/muffled in comparison to what I am used to with LTE on the older Note 4. While the sound is tolerable from mobile to landline, mobile to mobile is dreadful. 2) Sometimes calls go straight to voicemail rather than ring the phone. Often the call doesn't even show up on the call history (I only know it came though if the caller leaves a message). It's an intermittent issue; maybe happens 20% of the time. But I never had this happen on the Note 4 and I live in the same area. From chatting with T-Mobile support, it sounds like the issue is related to the lack of VoLTE—sometimes calls get lost when the device has to switch from LTE to 3G. Assuming they are right, to get calls as often as possible, you can force the network to use GSM only, but that’s 2G, which is even poorer quality and the data is extremely slow. 3) The call volume on Bluetooth headsets is very quiet. Sometimes I can barely hear what the person on the other end is saying. I have both the call volume and Bluetooth volume maxed. The volume is fine when listening to music; it's only quiet during a call. I tried multiple Bluetooth headsets, including LG HBS-1100 (I own two and tried both), LG HBS-820, Jabra Elite 45e, and several other off-brands. All had volume issues. A problem I never experienced on my older Note 4. Things I tried: 1) I fully reset the phone and set everything up again. 2) Ran it in safe mode. 3) Fully updated the phone. 4) I returned the phone and got a replacement; same problems. 5) I removed my case as suggested by Sony support. 6) I checked signal strength, and it stays solid between 3-5 bars, so that isn’t an issue. I spent many hours scouring the web and talking to support to find a solution, but none worked. T-mobile did suggest a mini-tower device called the 4G LTE CellSpot, which they provide with a deposit of $25 plus shipping. It connects to your internet, assuming you have high-speed. Even though the phone does not have WiFi calling, it sorta acts like it does. Your device will not see this as a Wi-Fi connection as the 4G LTE CellSpot creates an actual signal for the phone like a tower. Supposedly. I decided not to try it out myself. I’ve had bad experiences with VoIP technology in the past. The drawback (other than consuming more electricity and internet bandwidth) is that it only works within a 3,000 square feet broadcasting distance. So it doesn’t solve any issues when away from home. In the end, I returned the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra (for a second time). It’s an amazing device when used for anything but calls, but fails miserably at the phone department (at least with T-Mobile under my circumstances). Unfortunately, that’s kind of an important feature in a phone. Ended up biting the bullet and paying for a T-Mobile phone directly from them (OnePlus 6T) rather than taking my chances on another unlocked one. This way I know for sure it’s fully compatible.",6,"Sony"

"2515","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","I have had this phone for a while. I wanted to be able to use it, but unlike those who seem to have their cell phones surgically applied to their hand or ears, I only wanted one for emergencies when my husband or I am out of the house. I am disabled so there is a lot of potential for problems. I did not want to get involved with a cell phone contract, since when I became disabled I had to pay to get out of current cell phone contract 17 years ago in the vicinity of $70 which is a lot of money when you aren't making any but cheaper than continuing the contract to the end. I wanted to be able to use as needed and buy minutes as needed. However, no matter what I did, I can't get into the phone and I couldn't find in the paperwork how to do so. I got a plethora of little bits of paper most saying ""important information' in a font size too small to be read by most humans eyes. I bought a kit to set up the phone and it gave me the options of three different companies all with different SIM cards, I think they were. Since I couldn't figure out which I should use, I was online for a while with online tech support. When he got to the point of telling me I had to insert a number, I had to ask what number. As far as I could tell, none of the little bits of paper had this magic number on it. So from telling me at the beginning of the online discussion that certainly he could help me get set up, to no he couldn't. So currently I am sitting here still with a phone I can't use, a kit I had to buy that currently is worthless. I will try again if and when I have time to chase the Sony folks that in their 'brochure' on how to work the phone tell you to click the ? on the phone. Well, what does one do when they can get the phone to turn on enough to see the ? and I know I had charged it fully? I am sure that the phone works perfectly fine and the problems I had were with me.

My current phone is an LG Fiesta 2, so that's my comparison point. If I ever go back to a GSM carrier, I'll update this review to include those features. The phone feels good in my hand - substantial but not heavy. The screen is bright and the images are clear. I've got hand tremors and since the camera function has no stabilization feature, I haven't used it much, So I'm not the reviewer for a good camera comparison. WiFi connections are quick. Updates seem to be pushed through timely. Sound level is not that great but comparable to my last couple of phones. Bluetooth had no problem finding my Sony portable speaker (no surprise). I'm one of those people who goes through ALL the settings, so I've got this tuned for the least ongoing battery drain. The battery is smaller than that in my Fiesta 2 (which is 4500 mAg). I wind up charging it every few days (I've been using it primarily for audiobook playback recently). I haven't had much difficulty finding what I need in the settings. The main negative about this phone is that it doesn't use the standard micro-USB plug on its charger (or even a mini-USB plug) so you always have to carry its specific charger with you if you're going to be using it a lot. That's not convenient. Bottom line, though, is that I like this phone. It's easy to use, the functions make sense, and the form is pleasing.",NA,"Sony"
"2519","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","​The Sony Xperia L2 is a versatile multipurpose phone. It is great for texting and calling. There is a few downsides though. One downside that has come to my attention is the very laggy keyboard that takes some getting used to if you have switched from an iPhone. Another thing that would take some getting used to is the size of the phone. The phone is not the easiest to hold on to and it is a little slippery on the back. There are no good case options. If you surf Amazon a little bit you might find some but not any from a name brand company like Otterbox or Speck. All of the cases on Amazon do not have any reviews so I would be a little leery about buying some of them and actually trusting them with your phone. Overall the Xperia L2 is a pretty nice smartphone. I would not recommend this phone to a previous iPhone user but this phone does make the perfect gift for a beginner in the smartphone world.",1,"Sony"
"2520","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","Generally, I'm a fan of Sony and have been wanting to try this phone out for a while. This phone came in a plain box, and without any accessories such as head phones. The only thing included was the power supply and USB cable. The set up for the phone was pretty usual, and to expedite things, I skipped through the multiple options such as connecting it to your google account, etc. The HD display is medium-sized--5.5''--and the phone features a curved back panel though I didn't really feel the difference. Perhaps if it had a curved front screen instead it would have been more of a unique feature. I like the fact that this phone has two cameras (13MP main camera and 8 MP front-facing camera) as well as a fingerprint sensor, which I have only encountered with more expensive phones. The fingerprint sensor does take some time to set up and you have to set up a pin as well, but afterwards it's very easy to unlock the screen with your fingerprint. Overall, though the design is nothing special. Navigation is easy, but it would have benefitted from something extra, such as a higher resolution since this one is only 720p . It also would have been nice if it had some additional accessories with it. However, as a mid-range phone this suffices.",NA,"Sony"
"2521","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","There are many choices in the $200+ category, perhaps led by the Moto G series that works with the big four US phone carriers. The Sony L2 on the other hand only works with the GSM carriers. But it has NFC (if you are interested in using contactless payments like Android Pay), and USB-C (the ""new"" connector of the future) instead of microUSB. It has a fingerprint reader on the back (works well, I didn't have any false positives). Despite the USB-C connection, it is USB version 2.0, not 3.x. And it does not support USB Host / OTG. Charging is slow, it takes about 3 hours from empty to full. It's the slowest device to charge among everything that I recharge on a regular basis. Battery life is about average. It get about two days but I pay attention to app battery use and data use and uninstall the hungry ones. The screen is big enough you can use the mobile version of many websites these days. 3GB of RAM was a great idea, as it gives you more flexibility when you are multitasking. It's under 1GB RAM free most of the time, so had they given it 2GB of RAM, it would be suffering. I don't play games or run intense apps. Web browsing, music, productivity, weather, and payment apps and the like all work fine without stalling. Overall, it feels good in the hand. I haven't fumbled it yet. A case is not a bad idea either if you are a fan of using cases. The phone has its one One Handed use feature which gives you a smaller screen box that you can move around. It is useful for some apps that may have large buttons or simple navigation, like timers. Harder to use with something like a web browser. Easy to activate by swiping diagonally upwards from either the bottom left or bottom right edge of the screen. Sony's Xperia UI and custom apps are not the worse of customizations but they are not stock Android either. Disable or turn off anything that you don't plan on using, so they don't buzz around in the background eating battery and data. There are some other pre-installed apps that can be disabled but not uninstalled. The Home Screen grid can be adjusted, and it's not a huge screen with high resolution, so I didn't install a 3rd party Home Screen. For regular use, I find the 720p screen to be fine for my needs: the videos I watch are of the YouTube kind, not movies. Speaking of the screen, it has an Adaptive brightness mode which works pretty well but it takes 1-2 seconds to adjust, for example if you going in and out of shade (eg walking under trees on a sunny day) you feel like it should have adjusted about 1-2 seconds earlier to the change in lighting. The screen loves collecting fingerprints, so keep a microfiber cloth handy. It is readable in the middle of the day outdoors at maximum. The power saving mode is customizable, it doesn't have to start at 15% remaining, but once it starts it doesn't let you increase screen brightness (hard to read outdoors). There's also an Ultra Stamina mode which makes it more of a phone than a smartphone when you are close to empty. The audio, both the speakers and the standard headphone jack are about as you would expect for the price range. The single speaker is on the bottom right corner of the phone. You can quickly almost mute it by covering it with a finger (eg if someone is trying to tell you something over the music). You have about 21 GB free out of the box (it has 32GB total), and a microSD drive if you want to add more. It runs Android 7.1.1 with the November 2017 security patch level as of review time. I do not know if Sony has plans to put Oreo on it.",NA,"Sony"
"2522","B077ZMWX1W",3,"false","This phone wouldn't be bad for a true budget phone. However, priced as a midrange phone. As a midrange phone it falls short. Let's start with the display. It is bright enough, and large enough. But the resolution is 720p. For a midrange phone we would expect 1080p. A high end phone would have qHD. The battery is decent size, but the Mediatec chip is made on a 28nm process. Most midrange phones now have a 14nm processor that is much less heavy on the battery. Expect sub-par battery life. Also expect mediocre performance on more demanding apps like 3d games. As far as carrier compatibility it should work on the listed carriers, T-mobile or AT&T networks and the prepaid carries that use their networks. However, it doesn't support T-mobile's band 66 or band 71, which at this point is expected for a mid-range phone but is still disappointing. Worth considering instead is the Moto G PLUS (5th Generation) - 64 GB - Unlocked - Lunar Gray - Prime Exclusive. It has more ram, better battery life, better screen, better camera, more storage, more LTE bands (all the AT&T and T-mobile bands except T-mobile's new band 71), etc. It's also cheaper. Also worth considering is the Huawei Honor 6X Dual Camera Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB Gold (US Warranty). The Honor6X doesn't support AT&T's band 17, or T-mobile's bands 66,71. So if you plan to use it on T-mobile it works as well as the Xperia L2, but a little worse than the L2 on AT&T. But compared to the Xperia L2 it has a nicer screen, camera, battery life, and processor. It's also cheaper than the Xperia L2. So, there are probably better choices out there.

It's at least a half inch longer than the screen and about a quarter of an inch wide. It makes it seem like it will have a nice, large display, but then you turn it on and the display is very average. Also, there is just a think blank area at the bottom. If they are going to have this much not-screen space they should have put the home and back buttons, and fingerprint reader there. Instead, the home and back buttons are part of the screen and the fingerprint reader is on the back. It's a weird, illogical design. The display is not very sharp. I turned the brightness all the way up and it's still a bit dull. I know at this price range it's not going to compare to S8+, but I still expected better.

"2528","B077ZMWX1W",3,"false","3 stars doesn't mean this phone is bad. It is okay. Which is what 3 stars is. It is a fairly basic smartphone with Android 7.1.1 (at least for me it hasn't upgraded beyond that. When I do a system update it says up to date with Nov 2017 security patch). But it is still updating apps as I write this. The phone was easy to set up with my gmail account and with the security keyfob I have for extra login security. The phone itself is a basic smartphone. At the $249 or lower price it is worth it if you need an Android phone. Camera isn't bad. Not the best resolution but at this price it is good. Selfie camera does have a wider angle than any phone I've had. Nice to see USB-C plug so it is future proof for chargers.",NA,"Sony"
"2529","B077ZMWX1W",2,"false","Just knocked another star off after quite a few weeks of use and a lot more frustration. I was also finally compelled to activate it and now I would probably take off another, but want to give it a few more weeks before deciding if it's me or the phone, or more likely both, but as my first Android phone it may take a little time to feel I have given it a fair chance. I know it could just be me, since not only is this my first smartphone (save it, please) it’s my first Android device after several years with Apple mobiles. So, it may be hard to differentiate between the OS and the phone itself, but in the end it’s all part of the deal. On the other hand, I discovered that the battery can go from flat to full charge in about 90 minutes. A setting allows for a special charge mode that’s tons slower than usual, meant for overnight charging to build up and preserve battery life. I downloaded a few amp check apps and found the included Sony charger cranks out a real lot high rate, and if you use a generic the charge Tim Mel will likely double or more, It hits in the 450-500 mA range, and most third party blocks only deliver 40-100, so don’t expect your AC/USB combo to bring it back in less than maybe 6 hours. As usual, I downloaded the manual and printed it, call me quaint but it works. It too is poorly organized and hard to find what you need. If voice command is a feature, I have yet to find it, considering this is an “entry level”phone, I would not be surprised, just disappointed. But, like any tech, the more you use it, the more you adjust, I still have no case for it and it seems robust enough in construction to take a lot of abuse. I carry it in my back pocket unprotected most of the time, and its large size let’s it slip up when I sit or drive. Call it destructive testing, so far it passed well. Still, there was not enough to impress. For that matter, not dislike intensely. Maybe if I had never seen one before, but that only happened once. The price is high for an entry level” smartphone, but I suppose not that bad comparatively. I don’t know what else you could find in this price range that might be better, so I’ll just assume not much. It's about as large as a phone can be and still carried in a typical pocket, which is sort of helpful to aging eyes. I still have not found a case I like, so this keeps the form factor to a minimum, and it seems to be holding up wear-wise pretty well.. I am not sure about the 5.5"" claim, I measured 5-5/16"" X 3-3/4"". Spitting hairs, but, whatever. Setup was relatively easy, although some of the security features are oddly optioned to the user. Being used to fingerprint reads as the best way for me, I started with that. And immediately discovered the programming process took a lot longer than my iPad, and after continuing use I found it to be extremely difficult to nail the first or even second time. I could say that’s a deal breaker right off the top, but I found a case for it that would do a better job of centering your finger for the read. The sensor is right below the camera lens and for quite awhile I flat out missed and it took even longer to unlock. The Sony name has long been my first go-to in electronics, although they seem to have slipped a lot in the last few years, and certainly are a relatively new presence in the cellphone arena. When I upgraded from the venerable Nokia 2110 I did consider what was then called the “Sony/Ericsson” and while it seemed to look OK, something about the dual branding bothered me and I went with another Nokia, the virtually indestructible (and now slightly collectible) 6103. Enough about my history, but you should know where I’m coming from. I tried all the other security features, including some new to me, (well, they all are) such as “trusted place” which makes sense but doesn’t seem to work all that well, and “trusted person” which actually if it’s just on someone’s body. Anyone. I skipped the facial recognition, even the Sony warning suggested it was not very accurate and probably a bad idea. Pattern recognition was fun for a few hours, but for testing I just left it unlocked and at home. So now I find my finger unlocks the phone best when I don’t want it to, like just moving it around, and once on, the voracious thing begins to eat away at the battery charge. Oh, that: surprisingly short. It seems even with nothing running except WiFi, it drops down to 70-80% in very short order. With moderate use it’s even worse. You will get good at turning off everything but life support, as they frequently say in Star Trek, but then you must restart whatever services you need each time. I think the screen layout is cluttered and busy, instead of build-as-you-go there’s lots of stuff- Google stuff, obviously, that needs to be prioritized. I hope other keypads aren't like this one, just unacceptable. When turning it to Landscape, instead of compressing and enlarging it, it just flattens and widens. Not helpful. I do not care for the main control buttons, again, this could be an Android thing, but in certain apps- games, mostly- if you need to switch to an alert or other app, while in full-screen use they just vanish and there’s no way to minimize or switch (that I have discovered) unless you close out and reopen. Which, in the case of a favorite game, should you be unlucky enough to do this while still in play, just kills it. I have not found this to be true with the competition. The camera? don't even ask. Sub-par, although you might be able to squeeze off a decent photo or two. Considering Sony has been turning out some excellent DSC's and DSLR's it's an almost unforgivable sin. The photo on the right is from the Xperia, the left from my old DSC -W50. Neither will win a prize, but both taken at about the location. The DSC was partial zoom, to give it a better shot the Xperia was not. (The rest of the trip down I-80 through San Francisco is almost crowded with huge billboards consisting of stunning photos and simply the words, ""Taken with iPhone X.) Not that there could be any comparison, but, you know. How hard could it be? Perhaps a case of just downgrading something to justify the higher price for a better model. All it did was frustrate me, the controls here are small and sloppy and I doubt it would ever be useful in anything less than say 2 minutes. Maybe with practice, but it bugs me. Too easy to switch from video to still or manual without being aware. File management seems clumsy; likewise editing- the controls seem to come and go as they please, imprecise and difficult to master. Especially compared to other smartphone cams I have used. Not good for photos on the fly; it's easier and faster than the Xperia for me to pull out my iPad mini for grabbing a snap in a hurry, even from locked. It only seems to open the camera easily while the phone is being drawn for another reason. Or a lot of other apps that open while you're pulling it out of a pocket. Seems the fingerprint recognition works best when you don't actually try. I have noticed a tendency, when apps are minimized, they do not recover. Especially in a game I am fond of, if I pause to switch to something else, it just locks up the game, so I have learned to not do that if I am having a good run. You know, this is the important stuff, I still aver games are what has driven tech development more than anything since the Pong days. As far as using it for a phone, I will admit I was unwilling to deal with that; since it’s called a “phone” I have to assume that’s the thing it does best, how hard could it be? But so many other operations are peculiar, I may pick up a short-term micro sim go-phone deal and see how I like it. As expected, even playing music sounds like something you might have expected from Sony maybe 50 years ago Sizewise it’s about as big as you can get, it’s nearly half the size of my Mini- bit thin and even durable, I braced for the worst and tried a sit-down test (on a soft surface) and it did not seem to bother it, I assume the construction is both strong and flexible enough to put up wit this a few times. I have to admit construction is solid, I sat on it; used it to program a sprinkler controller dropping it on wet dirt a few times or just accidentally getting it hosed, no problem. Both Bluetooth and WiFi connect efficiently, although the handoff between routers was slow and not always fast enough to avoid interrupting or stopping downloads. Changing Bluetooth devices can take more time in recognizing the switch, sometimes I needed to “forget” a device before it would see the one I wanted. OK, almost always. The range is adequate. I also found the WiFi range to be quite good, when I was using it to adjust the irrigation timer it dealt with a signal from the house at about 100’, obstructed only by some trees. So before I get going on the Apple/Android thing any more, which is actually hard to avoid, I can wrap up by saying I am unimpressed, short battery life, app and messy OS layout just don’t seem to cut it for me, if they could drop at least $100 from the MSR, I would definitely consider it acceptable, but I would bet if you stretched out a little and could live with a slightly smaller screen and layout, I’d go for a low-end Samsung, perhaps a refurbished Galaxy you’d probably be happier in the long run. Love a chance to find out for myself, but when am finally forced to commit to losing my ever so practical flip phone, I do not think it would be to anything in this class.",2,"Sony"

It was pretty fun too. It already has a lot of common apps on it (Facebook anyone?) so I haven't even had to transfer my date from my iphone to this phone yet. I'm going to take the sim card out of my iphone and play with this, but primarily, I want to get a google voice number and use it for work.

"2533","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","The Sony Xperia L2 is a horse of a different color for me, as this is my 1st Android and.... the phone I received is black, not pink :) - Thank you Amazon/Vine for straightening that out! Anyway ... this is my 1st Android experience as I have been a user of ""eyephones"" for 10 years or so, so this one took a while for me to adjust to.... First off, build quality is very good, but not quite as tight as the higher end smartphones... And while not quite as user friendly/intuitive as the more expensive phones, it is very easy to navigate once you have been around the block a few times. At this price point, it is a great phone as you really get alot for your money, just not quite as much as you get for alot more money lol While casual users will likely find this perfect for their needs, it is likely most ""hardcore"" smartphone afficianados will need to spend more money to get that cutting edge tech high that will satisfy, as IMO this is more like a smartphone ""lite"" experience. Not to say that the Xperia is uninspired as that is not the case at all.... the more I use it the more I find to like about it, there are lots of little nuances here & there that are just different/unique & fun. In fact.... I have switched carriers & now use this Xperia as my everyday phone... why? well, with this ""free"" phone & a less expensive monthly service plan I have saved alot of money.... & it wasn't with Gieco! Pros - Big screen, touchscreen is dialed in just right, call quality is very good, battery life is very good, unlocked, expandable memory, good camera with wide angle selfie, alot of cool ringtones to choose from, fingerprint sensor ID, Cons - The quick start guide is too sparse & a bit hard to read, IMO this minimalist approach may save a little coin - but it is an idea that has come & should be gone by now - give us back our comprehensive well illustrated easy to read instruction manuals allready! :) Also, the big screen is great for photos, games & Google maps n such, but this is a phone that does not fit well in my pocket! Any other things I could mention would be giving into exessive nit-picking.... Overall - this is a really nice phone that has everything I need in a smartphone & it serves it's purpose very well ... IMO this one is well worth considering, especially if you just want a decent new smartphone without making a major investment, 4 stars/recommended!",1,"Sony"
"2534","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","First, the phone I received was black, not gold, but I didn’t take a star off for that because it doesn’t affect the functionality of the phone. With that being said, I’m used to owning the latest iPhone models for personal use and Samsung for business. This phone is so darn slow compared to my others. However, there is also a very significant price difference so comparing this phone to those would be akin to comparing a ChromeBook to a gaming laptop. It’s not apples to apples. For an entry-level phone this does work pretty well. The screen isn’t as responsive as I wish it would be and, as mentioned, the phone is definitely a lot slower than I’m used to. The battery life is very impressive however. There are cheaper entry-level phones on the market that I feel would work almost if not just as well, which is why I deducted one star.

From the beginning I noticed that the battery doesn't last very long at all. Don't expect this phone's battery to last an entire day, probably 10 hours at most if you're actively using it. Another huge downside for me is the overheating. I often listen to podcasts or watch movies on my phones and to have the battery quickly draining and extremely hot to the touch if it's on charge leaves me worrying about how long this phone will last anyone who is more actively using their device.",1,"Sony"
"2538","B077ZMWX1W",3,"false","What I don't like about this phone - the audio I took some time to get used to this phone... but I just can't give it above a 3 star rating. Background. I replaced my Samsung Mega with this ... and I did not dock any points for this being smaller ... I did expect that. What I don't like about this phone - the audio. Even if it's all the way up as high as possible, it is not very loud. I used to put my phone on the passenger seat on speaker phone function and talk when I'm driving. I can't do that with this phone. I can't hear the other person. I also don't like all the emoticons and moving gifs that comes up when you want to share a picture in a message. There is dancing broccoli, toast, and other things ... then under that is the camera and gallery and then under that, Google Pay options. I like simple and am going to try to see if I can delete all that stuff. I am including a picture of what is shown when you press the + sign to add something to a message. The charger connector part that goes into the phone is shaped different than all the other Android chargers in the house - so you can't share chargers. Somehow the camera gets switched over to video quite frequently by accident. The phone also makes the picture smaller when I am going through photos or even on a webpage - I have never seen a phone do this - one wrong swipe. It's hard to explain this ... and I can't get it to do it on purpose to get a screenshot. But the whole screen instead of filling the space, it has a border of nothing around it and you have to click to make it back to full-size again. When you go to your photo gallery ... the pictures are all small at the bottom and the top has a slideshow of your pictures. Why would anyone need a slideshow that just starts on its own? I finally did get the setting for my security code straightened out and that works pretty good for me now. Every time I hit the power button to turn the screen off, it would require the code again, that got old. But, as I said, I did get that straightened out and am happy with it set at 2 minutes delay before locking. I replaced my phone because I wanted a better camera ... and this camera is pretty good. The phone works well besides the audio being too low. This phone annoys me with the little things that mess up. I am installing a software update now ...

"2540","B077ZMWX1W",5,"false","I wonder if we don’t fool ourselves when evaluating the performance of cell phones these days. Demanding response times that our desktop or laptop computers struggle to meet or video displays that rival the top line television screens in a five or six-inch display are questionable standards. Will the majority of smartphone users need or notice the difference between a 720p or 1080p display on their handheld display? These are important questions in the modern competitive environment where the race to greater processor speed, display resolution and audio quality drive the price of a device to better than $1,000 dollars. If the user isn’t going to require the greatest video resolution to watch Netflix for hours on end, why pay for it. If the major use of the device is going to be management of email, messages and calendar organization, is the entertainment audio as important? The competitive space for a full-featured but reasonably priced device is one to consider for these (perhaps the majority of) users and the Xperia L2 should definitely be considered. This full-featured Android phone does everything well that I asked of it. Telephone calls were strong and clear without lost connections. Messaging is snappy and well managed, and the battery life is extraordinary. Where my higher spec’d phones will blow through a charge in a day or day and a half, the Xperia was miserly with its battery use, stretching over two days. The display is bright and clear and photos, videos and interface items all look good. The audio quality of the phone is good in your headphones, but the bottom speaker could be better. If your main use is going to be listening to music without a headset another unit may be a better choice but if your headphone drivers produce the sound, the Xperia remains a solid choice. The L2 is a not a cutting-edge phone. It runs Android 7 so any features that you require in version 8 will be missing. The case of the phone is plastic and might need a case if you are rough with your electronics, but it held up fine in my pocket. These are all trade-offs to be considered for the price, the increased battery life and other features of this excellent phone. To me, they’re worth it.",2,"Sony"

It has a camera with 13MP and can take 1080p pictures/video, but not 4K. It requires 3300mAh battery, which is rather difficult to get to, so it's not easily interchangeable--it requires suction to pull out its back panel, and the battery is clearly not meant to be replaced by the user (-1). For security, it supports fingerprint scan and visual connect-the-dots scheme. It appears that fingerprint scan may stop at some point, and it insists that the lines be drawn, irrespective of fingerprint. If you forget the pattern, the only way to recover the phone seems to be using gmail account (or phone #, but I didn't connect the phone with a carrier) with a Sony website: myxperia dot sonymobile dot com (Amazon prohibits external URLs in a review). From that web page, one can lock the phone with a message. To actually recover the phone from a forgotten pattern, erasing the phone appears to be necessary. Back in the phone, the device gets erased as instructed remotely. It gives the user the option of starting clean. Unfortunately, it never seems to be ""clean"", because it demands (-1) the email that was used to proceed prior to erase.

I'm used to Android from other handheld devices, so it was immediately usable to me. There wasn't a lot of hunting or ""how do I use this thing?"" statements like there is when I try to use my wife's iPhone. The interface feels natural to me. Love having a larger screen and a better camera. Love being able to use it as a wireless device to save on cell usage. Generally love having the power of a smart phone in my hands. My biggest difficulty was in the initial setup. I assumed, being an unlocked phone, I could use it on my current cell provider, Verizon. After checking online, and then making trips to not one, but two, Verizon stores, I found that not to be the case. Seems there's some disconnect (feud) between the companies that makes the use of a Sony phone impossible. No Verizon SIM will work in them. So, what did I do? Changed cell carriers. Sony has a longstanding relationship with AT&T, and Cricket (now owned by them) has coverage similar to Verizon in my area--so I switched. That might not be an option for all users. So do some research before buying this phone! One feature that would be useful on this phone is Wifi calling that other Xperia phones have. Cell coverage in our home seems to be hit-and-miss with this phone and Cricket. (While my wife's iPhone with Verizon seems to work everywhere.) Wifi calling would remedy that. It would also be nice if Sony would work to boost their presence in the US cellphone market. No one I talked to (Cricket or Verizon) had seen a Sony phone before. It was like they are an off brand.

It is easy to set up - I was able to use the included migration assistant to transfer all my contacts and apps from my old phone to this new one. The camera is decent, but nothing to write home about. It snaps okay pictures, but despite being captured at 13MP, they tend to be a bit blocky. Focus isn't always precise. The phone functions are excellent - it is easy to make and recieve calls and to send messages - I've noticed that the keypad is very responsive and accurate. Sound quality is good both talking and listening to calls. The device is a bit on the large side- my previous phone was small enough that i could reach anywhere with one thumb, without having to stretch or strain. The L2 requires a bit of stretching, or the use of two hands for full screen control. The fingerprint scanner works - but very frequently I get a ""finger moved too fast"" or ""partial fingerprint only"" notification and have to rescan. In most settings that isn't a major issue, but if I find myself in an emergency situation, it might become one. A week after I got this phone, my it began to report my SD card as corrupt. I immediately bought another one, and today, just two days after the replacement, it too is now showing up as corrupt. It is from a different manufacturer from the original. One thing I liked initially is that the slot for SIM card and SD card is on the outside of the phone, so you can replace both without having to remove the back of the phone. However, the design of the slot is a bit clunky. In order to remove the SD card, you have to take out a small tray which holds the SIM card. The SIM card is loose in its tray, which means you can easily drop or lose your SIM card while opening the tray up.

"2550","B077ZMWX1W",5,"false","We wanted an additional phone to put into service under our name now and later transfer to someone else’s name. A phone that they could migrate to a different network without much hassle. After looking at options, we decided that the Sony Xperia L2 would serve our purposes well. It fits the requirement of being unlocked, giving it the ability to migrate to compatible carriers by simply changing the SIM card. It’s an affordable full featured smartphone that’s priced one half to two thirds less than popular flagship level phones. Compared to flagships like the S8, Pixel2, etc, the L2’s cameras aren’t the equivalent, its screen is smaller with resolution that’s not as crisp, plus there’s a slight lag in processing time. That said, I expect that anyone new to smartphones would be oblivious to the differences. Moving to this phone from a 2017 / 2018 flagship could be a disappointment, but otherwise I’d expect anyone getting the L2 to be completely satisfied. The recipient of ours is our new intern (and youngest nephew) who got his last phone when he started school three years ago. The L2 is state of the art in comparison, so he’s thrilled. Five Stars for the L2 being everything we wanted.",NA,"Sony"

"2552","B077ZMWX1W",3,"false","(Initial 4-star review) Despite the famous Sony name, Sony is not exactly the frontrunner in the cellphone market world. I can't believe how expensive cellphones are, but this is a good-enough one for those who want a little more than a super-basic, clunky one but don't need all the fancy features. It's a good basic phone. The startup was very quick and easy with my T-Mobile service. With Android phones, I can't tell if the quirks are cellphone issues or Android issues. While I use my cellphone, it's not my primary computing machine. I use it to browse online, text, email occasionally, check sports scores, do some financial transactions via various apps, take photos/videos and call. I also stream baseball games via MLB, and that works fine. I do have an issue with the camera. It's not the best at 3x zoom. This may be an Android issue, but the photos look a bit too smoothed out. Maybe that's how people like it, but it feels unnatural, and I do not look that young, hahaha. I did get a case for it because it doesn't feel comfortable in my hand. it's also a little big, with too much of the screen real estate taken up by the bezel, but I've owned worse. I recommend the one from MYLB which has a slim case AND a screen protector: Sony Xperia L2 case,with Sony Xperia L2 screen protector. MYLB (2 in 1)[Scratch Resistant Anti-fall] fashion Soft TPU Shockproof Case with Sony Xperia L2 glass screen protector (Black) My cellphone feels comfy, as if it belongs in my hand. Maybe I'm so used to having budget phones that this one feels nice, but in this day and age, you have to pay more than twice as much for many other popular brands. Sure, this may not have all the media features of Samsung or iPhones, but it serves today's smartphone needs fine at a wallet-friendlier price. Also, I've realized for really great photos and videos, a separate camera still does better than the best cellphones that are naturally limited. So, it doesn't make sense for me to pay a lot for a cameraphone with worse photo and video qualities when I'll be using a separate camera for those times. Edited to add: 12/8/2018 for 3-star review: The picture quality is not that good, despite being a Sony. I don't know if there's too much editing going on in the background, but the pictures and videos aren't great, especially when you zoom in a little bit after the image is taken. Also, the zoom only goes up to 3x. The cellphone is okay. I don't need the bloatware of Sony apps, but I'm stuck with it.",3,"Sony"
"2553","B077ZMWX1W",5,"false","I like my new Sony XPERIA phone. It transferred everything from my old phone easily. The tutorial got me started quickly. I'm figuring out how to do everything I want to on the phone except get it to work with my Square card reader. I love the fingerprint security! So much easier and faster than putting in a pin code. There are two small things I'm really not thrilled about. One is the position of the screen on/off button. It is right on the center of the side where you grab the phone to pick it up. I am constantly turning the screen on or off when I don't mean to. The other thing I find inconvenient is getting to voice to text. It should be easier for a function meant to be a shortcut. I'm sure I will soon be used to it. This phone is learning me while I am learning it.",NA,"Sony"
"2554","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","The Sony Xperia L2 is a solid, basic Android phone that goes just that one step farther. At this price point, Sony had to make come compromises. So this is not a power-user or gamer's phone but for an inexpensive Android phone, you get sensitive touch controls, 32 GB RAM is extraordinary for a base model, responsive/vibrant 5.5 inch screen, a 3,300 mAh battery that will last you all day plus with constant usage, and even a fingerprint sensor on the back, all wrapped up in a full aluminum package. Unlike most phones at this level, this one has some heft to it because it is clad in metal. It is a GSM, multi-band phone that will handle an LTE network. Sony has chosen a generic Android 7.1 package without any added bells and whistles. So there's no freaky interface to negotiate--you can supe it up with add-ons as desired but if you like basic Android, you'll just leave it alone The compromises are evident, but, happily, still well thought out by Sony ---The MediaTek MT637T Quad-core 1.5 GHz processor is not top of the line; however, when you use the phone for daily tasks the performance is snappy and you really won't notice that you don't have a high-line microprocessor ---The screen is only 720p--not nearly Retina. That said, the display if vibrant and this 720p display is a lot more readable than the so-called 1080p screens on equivalent priced phones. Again, there is never a problem reading text and it sure doesn't seem pixilated. Even in bright light, the screen was easier to read than the screen on my iPhone 7. ---The rear camera takes quality 13 MP pictures that are far better than any I have seen in this category. They are detailed and the colors splash accurately across the screen. With sufficient light, video performance is superb. That said, the main compromise here is low-light performance which is not great. This is even more pronounced when taking videos is now light. ---The front facing, 8 MP camera Skypes well without jitters in real time ---It doesn't come with Gorilla glass but whatever facsimile of this is on the front, it seems to avoid scratches well. I take pretty good care of my phones, but have ditched a screen protector and cover for months and there are no scratches here. I have used this phone way too long before writing this review, but I have to say that lead time has given me a lot of hours with it. This blows away most entry phones. It may not have the specs of some higher line phones, and you cannot expect perfect specs from a phone at this price point, but, again, Sony took this ball and ran with it scoring the best deluxe entry phone they could deliver. It's been out there for a while but you'd still be hard pressed to find another entry phone that has all these features tied up in such a well thought out package. Recommended.",1,"Sony"
"2555","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","Excellent phone overall. The phone operates quickly with whatever task or app being used. Storage is more than enough and you can add a micro sd card. Screen quality is good. Camera is decent at taking pictures but limited in options. You can only choose a 4:3 or 16:9 format. No square format or panoramic feature. The front facing camera has a fish-eye effect. Sound is loud if you need it to be. Battery life is very good. It takes longer to charge than my previous LG however. Design style is nice and up-to-date. As a whole I like this and for me it's an improvement. But the lack of camera features is a minus. If you take a lot of photos then this isn't a good phone. I'll most likely use this for a year or two then upgrade to something else.",NA,"Sony"
"2556","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","This was a lateral upgrade from a Samsung Galaxy S5, which started becoming glitchy (it likes to reboot itself once or twice a day). I wanted a new phone, but was unwilling to spend the $500-700 most phones fetch. The Sony Xperia L2 had some appeal, and I liked that it was unlocked (my Galaxy uses a sim card, thus easy transfer of info). Here are my thoughts: PROS * screen size. big without being obtrusive. able to read Kindle books really well * clear images/good resolution * excellent call quality * speed. this phone is markedly faster than my Galaxy S5, so opening apps and web browsing are snappy. fast loading streaming, too * price * feels solid enough, so hopefully will last a while (barring any drops on the ground) * housing is attractive and well-designed, lightweight. Feels good in my hand CONS * camera leaves something to be desired, despite being touted as high-end * comes pre-loaded with apps and bloatware I don't desire (Facebook, for one) VERDICT With the Xperia L2, I think you get what you pay for -- a mid-range phone with good features and a solid build, but won't compete with many Android favorites.

"2558","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","Cell phones are very personal items. Most of us have ours with us 24/7 and freak out when we leave it somewhere. If you are using a flip phone now than this Sony Xteria will be a huge leap on technology but if you're coming from a high-end phone than this will be a few steps back. If you're the type that is hard on your phone and have to replace it often than this lower priced phone is a good option. Please take my comments below as a review for a low-end phone. I am not comparing it to a eight hundred dollar work of tech. PROS: Responsive screen with good touch control. The 720p display looks clear enough for most humans. Eagles may complain. Only a few uninstallable apps. Camera is acceptable and has a flash. Videos look pretty good. Audio tone is nice for one small speaker. Easy and quick use menus. SD card slot a HUGE plus. Up to 256gb. Headphone jack on top. Call clarity and reception are good. Xteria app available for easy swap of phone information. Plays simple games like solitaire very nicely. Excellent battery life. Charges quickly. 3g ram, 32gb internal memory. CONS: No good cases are available.

And it costs one hundred and twenty less. Sony should drop the price a bit. Not good for high-end games. The screen is 5.5 but the phone is much larger. Low-end MediaTek processor. Recommended.

"2559","B077ZMWX1W",3,"false","Here is a breakdown of the good, the bad, and basic notes on the Sony experia L2 smartphone. The good: 1) The battery life is great. It also comes with a USB-C charging port. 2) The camera is good, and the selfie camera on the front has a wide angle so you can easily capture more people in your selfie without having to use a selfie stick. 3) Although the display is a 720p (not 1080p) it is not all that bad. 4) the speaker is quite loud, but do not expect a lot of bass. 4) good for the basics. The bad: 1) There is no fast/rapid charging. So, you can charge at about 0.6% per minute. It will take almost 3 hours to fully charge. 2) the port is a 2.0 so data transfer is not going to be super-fast. 3) I personally do not like the fingerprint reader location. It is on the back of the phone right below the camera. So you are likely to get more prints on the camera. I would like it better if it were on the front screen. 4) limited cases available. Also, the case would need to have a hole in the back at the fingerprint circle which will cause difficulty when trying to unlock using your print. 5) the phone is made of plastic and still weighs as much as the iPhone which is metal and glass. The notes: If you are going to spend $250 for this phone then you must have a brand preference for Sony. Otherwise, you can spend less and get more from other brands. Or you can spend a bit more and get a lot more.",1,"Sony"
"2560","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","This inexpensive unlocked GSM/LTE phone is a great all around performer! Slick, thin, and you can add extra storage via a microSD card. Don't expect miracles from the wide angle, though; it provides roughly the same angle of vision as the cameras on the iPhone. Still, if you want a capable brand new smartphone at a reasonable price, it's an excellent pick. However, a one year old gently used flagship phone can be found for a similar price, so that's also something to consider. For a new unlocked phone, though, I think it's a winner.",2,"Sony"

The times I've had to go online it was adequate but not exceptional Battery life appears to be about average but again I do little more than text and talk.

It connected cleanly and quickly. It grabs and hold wifi when roaming, bluetooth for printing, etc. The screen is clear and bright, and the phone audio is loud enough and clear. Video is good, and the sound is pretty good, too. I use earbuds for music. I use Amazon Prime's photo storage, so I can access my images on all my devices. I have only one concern, and that is the charging is erratic. I have had it show me the charging symbol only to check in the am and it never charged.

The display is just adequate and I am somewhat disappointed with the large border area of the screen for one of my intended uses (as a VR display for a Head Mounted Viewing)> There is a fingerprint reader on the reverse side of the phone and the camera characteristics are more than adequate. The biggest disappointment is in screen quality.",1,"Sony"

The battery lasts for a good two days, but takes about 6 hours to fully charge from 20%. The fingerprint scanner on the back takes a bit of getting used to, especially if like me, you are used to it being on the front. But the ability to add multiple fingerprints help to offset the learning curve, though it still doesn't recognize partial prints nearly as well as my iphone did. Other than the scanner I have no real complaints, it works great and I love the large screen! Is it the best in it's price range on the market? I have my doubts, but it's a good phone.",NA,"Sony"
"2566","B077ZMWX1W",4,"false","The Sony Xperia L2 is a nice looking smart phone running Android's older 7.1 Nougat operating system. The performance is decent for most basic applications and I found the screen to be bright enough once I turned off the auto brightness feature, which was much too dark for me. The battery seems large at 3300mah but probably because of the older CPU used, it will barely make it through the day with moderate usage, and will barely make it a few hours if you use the screen a lot to play games or watch video. There is a ""stamina mode"" to help save the battery, which of course comes with tradeoffs. The 720p screen looks ok but 1280x720 is almost ridiculous for a phone in 2018, and I would really look for 1080p or higher, especially with a 5.5 inch screen. The 13mp rear camera is ok, nothing super impressive but it does take decent photos in good lighting conditions. The front camera has a couple modes for single or group selfie photos and it works fine. The 8mp sensor is fine for social media and casual photos. I thought the audio was fine, not super loud but decent for listening to music or video. The phone comes with 32gb internal storage and has a micro SD slot to expand the storage. The fingerprint sensor works ok. I'm seeing it work maybe 70% of the time on the first try, which isn't too bad. The iPhone fingerprint sensor is closer to 100% but I realize that's an entirely different product. Overall, I am ok with the fingerprint sensor because it does work and I can just use my pin to get in if it isn't working. Sony includes a few proprietary apps but doesn't clutter the operating system up too much. I found the setup and use of the phone to be very nice and simple, I didn't have any issues with using it at all and everything worked as expected. In summary, this is an entry level phone that has a stylish Sony enclosure. It looks nice, and I do like the rectangular shape, but the price is a little high for some of the lower spec hardware and older software included. I think the look of this phone is probably its best feature, so if that isn't something you care about, maybe look around for a 1080p phone at a better price. Even at the entry level, I do like Sony's hardware quality over entry level models from brands like Huawei and even LG. For some people, the screen resolution and older CPU might not matter. So the Sony L2 is still something to consider, especially if the price goes down below 250 dollars. I had a good experience using this phone and will continue to use it as a secondary phone and as a backup device. For the price, I would rate this 3 stars. But overall, it's a solid 4 star product and I was impressed by the build quality for an entry level phone. It uses USB-C for charging, so at least it's somewhat up to date in that aspect. There is no Qi or other wireless charging ability and overall it's just a basic smartphone with a decent sized screen for someone who wants a stylish but basic phone for everyday casual smartphone use. The Gold and Blue colors that are offered are fun and different and also something to consider. For even more money but much better specs, check out the Sony XA2, which offers a much better Snapdragon 630 processor, 23mp camera, and gorilla glass screen, along with Android 8.0 and perhaps most importantly, a 1080p display for about 100 dollars more.",2,"Sony"

It doesn't have the brightest display or the fastest response time, but it's good enough for the purpose. The ""shutter"" speed of the camera is slow compared with my phone, but it's adequate, and the wide-screen selfie camera is fun for the kids. I don't know what the purpose of the big band of unused space at the bottom of the phone is -- it has no navigation buttons or anything on it. Couldn't the space have been used to enlarge the screen? The grip of the phone doesn't feel all that steady. A case could improve that, but then you'd lose the cool factor of the metallic color.

The Xperia seems slower, even without everything installed. The touch screen is also not as nice as it isn't quite as responsive and has a weird feel. The display itself if less than spectacular and the grip of the phone is quite horrible, though a good case can easily solve that issue.

This Xperia works well with Cricket. (It should also work with any T Mobile networks, as those are compatible with the same phones.).

That said, it should be plainly said that this is NOT a flagship-type smartphone. It's an entry-level, will-do-the-major-things-but-not-specatularly phone. Performance is entirely adequate for phone calls, texting, and email. It does stumble a bit on graphics-intensive or processor-intensive tasks or games, so this isn't some hidden gem powerhouse. If that's all you need, then this will fit that bill. As such, since it is a phone targeted at the lower end of performance, there are some corners kind of cut. The screen is adequate, and it does show content reasonably well. It isn't going to compete with a 4K TV though. Battery life is adequate and lasts me over a day with regular use. It was fairly simple to set up - just had to supply a SIM card, give the IMEI number to my carrier, and I was up and running in about fifteen minutes. But then there's the OS. It ships with an older version of Android, and I'm not clear if it's going to get an upgrade. Given the target of this phone, I'm thinking it's 50/50 whether it gets an OS update. As for construction, it has a plastic body (unsurprising at this price point) and the design is a little odd. There's an overlarge bezel at the bottom of the phone that...does nothing. No buttons, no nothing. The fingerprint sensor is on the back of the phone, so that's interesting...but there sure seems to be some wasted space on the front of the phone. It's a bit disorienting when I'm using the phone. So for what it is supposed to be - an entry level phone - it's right there.

"2589","B07B82VTX5",4,"false","The SONY Xperia XZ2 is a flagship cell phone that offers so much advanced and cool technology that we are bound to fall deeply in love. And then our hearts will be broken because it does not support VoLTE or WiFi calling on T-Mobile. Yes, the Xperia XZ1 Compact Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact - Factory Unlocked Phone - 4.6"" Screen - 32GB - Black (U.S. Warranty) does support VoLTE/WiFi calling, but the newer XZ2 does not. And in my case, this leads to tears. FUNCTIONALITY: The Xperia XZ2 has *NOT* been VoLTE certified by T-Mobile and does *NOT* work with either it's VoLTE/WiFi Calling technology. My Xperia XZ1 Compact works great with T-Mobile's VoLTE and WiFi Calling, so the lack of support here is particularly painful. I went from having crystal clear reliable calls all throughout my home on my XZ1 Compact, to having one bar that comes and goes on the XZ2. Sometimes calls ring, sometimes the calls go straight to voicemail. Text messages are slow to arrive. Areas exists throughout the house without any coverage. VoLTE/WiFI Calling solves my problem, and the XZ2 does not offer the solution. With WiFi Calling, the XZ1 Compact works well in my house. The XZ2 doesn't. The removal of the audio aux port is also a disappointment. Sometimes, and usually unpredictably, I need this feature. I don't want to carry around a dongle, this is a step in the wrong direction. The ambient light sensor that dynamically adjust the screen brightness on the XZ2 is a significant upgrade from the XZ1 Compact, however. The XZ1 was sometimes clumsy and aggressive with the display adjustments measured against ambient light. But the XZ2's display adjustments are both subtle and accurate. Unless you are paying close attention, you will not notice the screen slowly adjusting to the ambient light. The end result is a very pleasing comfortable brightness level that never strains the eyes. Calm transitions and relaxed pupils. Very impressive technology! UPGRADES: If you decide to purchase a XZ2 model, you will most likely want to upgrade the 64GB of internal storage with a microSDXC card. As of this writing, your best value is the (Samsung 256GB EVO Plus Class 10 UHS-I microSDXC U3 with Adapter (MB-MC256GA)). This 256GB Class 10 Grade 3 card will give read speeds up to 100 MB/s and writes up to 90 MB/s. These speeds are important with the new 4K HDR camera. You could buy and use a slower card unintentionally, so choose wisely... a slower card will still work but will result in reduced quality of video. DISPLAY: SONY boasts a full 1080 x 2160 resolution, High Dynamic Range (HDR) 5.7 inch TRILUMINOS display on the Xperia XZ2. And this screen looks amazing! As mentioned earlier, the ambient light sensor coupled with the dynamic contrast and brightness enhancer is leadership class technology. I've never seen it done this well before. The inky blacks are deep and without light, the color palette is rich and rewarding. Photographs have never looked better on a portable device. The larger 5.7"" diagonal is generous and allows comfortable reading. The touch screen is always immediately responsive. SONY also introduces their ""Dynamic Vibration System"" technology with the XZ2 generation. Although described in marketing materials as a futuristic tactile real-time haptic immersive technology that will pull you straight into your entertainment of choice, I'd describe it a a bit differently - it vibrates your phone during audio peaks. That's all. You can set it to three different levels when adjusting the volume. It's a flawed execution. The problem is that the vibrate action is a binary function for the most part - the phone can vibrate or not. There is no lead in to the vibration, there is no starting off with a low vibration and scaling into a heavy vibration. As a result, this tech is basically annoying and drains the battery faster than it would otherwise. AUDIO: Audio acoustics sound amazing, and as a portable speaker the XZ2 is at least on par with the XZ1. All sorts of new marketing and tech jargon is thrown at you such as DSEE HX, ClearAudio+, LDAC, ClearBass, and S-Force. But I can summarize the experience as follows: when I hold the XZ2 phone landscaped 2 to 3 feet from my face, the front firing stereo speakers are the best I have ever heard on a portable device, period. It's a technical achievement that has left me in awe. On the other hand, if I have the XZ2 phone laying on a counter while I am listening in the same room, then the speakers sound good... that's all, just good. This phone's audio has been engineered for a specific spatial position, and if you are watching a movie and holding the phone in front of you then you can expect a truly cinematic acoustic experience; it's absolutely amazing how the sound fills the room! I was almost convinced I was listening to a higher end 7.1 surround setup. Similarly, music is breath-taking when holding the XZ2 in position - I've never heard better music on an open air portable device. The position is critical though, set it back on the table and walk away and it sounds like a portable speaker once again. Bring it back into position and WOW! BATTERY: The life of the Xperia XZ2's 3180mAh battery drains faster than the smaller 2700 mAh battery on the Xperia XZ1 Compact. On a single charge my XZ1 Compact can get me through the day, and the next. The XZ2 will also reliably get me through the day, but it's best to charge it overnight. Heavy camera and screen use will drain it much faster, so it's nice to keep a little reserve in the tank. Impressive battery life nonetheless. ERGONOMICS: This phone is a two-handed operation. One hand will be needed to stabilize and hold the phone, and the other will be used to balance and navigate. This works well with the official SONY Style Cover Stand (SONY Model: SCSH50). The flip cover gives the left hand something to hold firmly, while the right hand can be used to lightly balance and easily move the right thumb to all corners of the screen. Even with my large hands and long fingers, holding the Xperia XZ2 with only the right hand restricts the thumb to the lower 1/3 of the screen area. For one-handed dexterous operation, you'll need the XZ2 Compact (Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact Unlocked Smartphone - 5"" Screen - 64GB - Black (US Warranty)). AESTHETICS: I miss SONY's default dynamic rings theme from the ZX1. The new paint droplets theme is neat enough, but it only animates when the fingerprint scanner is used to unlock the device. It feels lifeless compared to the interactive rings from the XZ1 theme. The rounded case corners are back, as opposed to the sharper corners on the XZ1. Much more comfortable and less wear and tear on my pockets. Welcome back rounded corners, you've been missed. I also really miss the wrist strap loop from the original Xperia Z1 Compact. It does not make a return this generation either, so a hard drop or two is most likely in this phone's future - drops that could be avoided by a wrist strap. CAMERA: One of the most anticipated, and most heavily marketed, feature is the new 4K HDR camera. When testing the 4K HDR video, I discovered the SONY software saves the movie into an MP4 file. Unfortunately, my LG 4k HDR television didn't recognize the mp4 file created by the camera software, which made viewing HDR content more difficult. Uploading to YouTube worked fine though, and the television recognized the HDR and 4k content through the LG YouTube app, but this is not the ideal solution. There is no doubt, the XZ2 can create videos that are impossible with other cameras; information is recorded that can only be captured with an HDR camera. My outdoor videos revealed details in shadowed areas while also capturing foliage in bright sunlight, and moving the shot from a tree-line to a bright clouded sky adjusted beautifully. Quite simply, the XZ1 cannot take videos like this. But all this comes at a cost - the camera app throws up a warning that the phone might start to overheat and dial back the technology automatically. Battery reserves will also take a serious beating while the camera heavily taxes the XZ2 hardware. The fast Qualcomm® Snapdragon 845 processor that's doing the heavy 4K HDR lifting requires a lot of juice when it's running full blast, and it generates a lot of heat. But ultimately, the new 4K HDR camera is very impressive technology in a phone of this size. Theres something special here, and there's nothing quite like it in Sony's lineup. CONCLUSION: The technology has left me in awe, I have loved using this phone! Sure, the missing headphone jack is annoying, but the display, the audio, wireless charging, the fingerprint scanner, and the 4K HDR camera have left me breathless. All this in a very beautiful sexy case with a nice clean modern version of Android installed. There is so much to love here. But ultimately, the lack of support for VoLTE and WiFi calling guarantees turbulence in this relationship. Without solid cell phone connectivity, my home life suffers. Oh, SONY XZ2, how I loved thee! It breaks my heart to pull open the SIM and MicroSDXC tray along the top edge with my fingernail. A tear drops as I gently remove that tiny little T-Mobile nano SIM card. I must return it now to my VoLTE/WiFI Calling XZ1 Compact. Goodbye my love, let it end on a night like this.",5,"Sony"

"2593","B07B82VTX5",4,"false","Sony has consistently had disappointing sales in the Android market. Sony has consistently hyped its new cameras with each succeeding generation, largely to a critical ""Meh"" reaction from the Android press. But Sony also has a core base of rabidly loyal fans who sing their phones' virtues. What's going on here? I should add, I am coming from the Xperia XZ Premium, and the Xperia XA1 before it, so I must have been in the fanboy camp, to some degree. Before that, I was a Nokia devotee on Windows Phone. DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY The Xperia XZ2 represents a change of course to some degree for Sony. They stuck with 16:9 LCD screens, headphone jacks, and relatively large top and bottom bezels for several years after other manufacturers had made their premium phones 18:9 with OLED. This time around, Sony has dropped the jack and trimmed the bezels significantly and adopted an 18:9 ratio, all of which definitely has the phone looking more ""on trend."" Thankfully, there is no ""notch."" The screen remains an LCD, but frankly it's not a great loss. The contrast ratio and brightness are excellent, and there are no concerns of burn-in, which is a very real issue on phone screens with static navigation icons. Overall, I like the change, as it allows for more information to be displayed on an app like Facebook, NYT, or Google. The LCD panel is 1080x2160 resolution, with HDR support. It has a pixel density of 424 pixels per inch, and no pixels are visible on text or images. It's solidly nice. The fingerprint sensor has been moved from the side power button (which was a fantastically useful placement) to almost the very center of the rear of the phone. Now, I will say, the sensor works great. I have not yet gotten a read error from any angle, and I've added four fingers total to the phone's memory. But the placement is not good. It's quite low, which makes it awkward, and the sensor is both close to and exactly the same size and shape as the camera. I purchased a case (Ringke Onyx Brushed Metal Design TPU) which mitigates this, as it has a sort of groove to guide your finger to the sensor only. But if you rock this phone naked, it is almost certain that you will finger the camera accidentally. SHOULD you rock this phone naked? That's a hard no. The phone is a ""glass sandwich"" ringed by an aluminum bumper, with Gorilla Glass 5 offering scratch protection. Predictably, it's an absolute fingerprint magnet, even with a solid oleophobic coating. The rear of the phone is curved, which combined with glass, makes this phone incredibly slippery. It will not sit still on a table on its rear. I miss the flat designs of prior Xperias, as well as metal/polycarbonate backs. The glass back does allow for Qi wireless charging, which works well. The rear camera has been moved from the top corner to the upper middle of the phone. I think this is kind of a ""six of one, half a dozen of the other"" sort of change. It's true that corner placement does result in some ""finger"" shots in landscape. Those are gone. But in their place are... finger shots in portrait. Sigh. They should have placed this higher along the middle of the phone if they were intent on moving it from the corner. Stereo speakers still grace the front of the phone, though the bottom speaker is now at the bottom edge, due to reduced bezel size. They are loud and high quality, great for videos and music. I would say that Sony's speakers are in the top two or three phones on the market, possibly even the best of the pack. SD card and Micro SIM are accessed on the top with a slide out panel - fingernail only, no need for a key. The phone will accept cards up to 400gb. Aesthetically, the phone is a looker. Sony has always excelled at industrial design, and the fit and finish are exceptional. I just think that the XZ1 and XZ Premium were better looking phones, for my tastes. It's got a bit of a fat backside, and it is heavy. But these are not dealbreakers for me. I like a bit of heft in something that costs this much. The phone is extremely durable and rigid, as indicated by ""Jerry Rig Everything"" testing on YouTube. SOFTWARE Sony's Android skin has not changed from previous iterations. It is very light, only really changing the App Drawer from up-down scrolling to left-right scrolling. Sony allows you to replace the launcher, which I did immediately, to Square Home 2 (I like my tiles, folks!). The home screen is completely customizable, with options for animations, swiping actions, icon size, icon packs, and the like. Sony includes a few of their own apps which duplicate stock android apps, such as Music and Album (for photos). I ended up choosing them over the stock apps because I find they work very well, with nice graphics (the pinch zooming of your camera roll in the Album app is really cool). Sony has included an ""Xperia Assist"" app, which gives a chat interface for tips and tricks, with an AI respondent. Thankfully, it does nothing more. OK Google is fine, and it works well here. PERFORMANCE With a Snapdragon 845 and 4gb of RAM, this phone screams through everyday tasks. There are no lags whatsoever on any task, and app switching is instantaneous. Regular use does not create much in the way of warmth, though of course fast charging or wireless charging does heat things up (as does recording video in 4K HDR). BATTERY LIFE Sony's reputation for excellent battery life is safe with the XZ2. A full day of heavy use is easy to achieve, and 1.5 days with moderate use is also easy. Sony's Stamina mode and Adaptive charging modes are still present, as well. Stamina mode usually gives you extra few hours of juice by limiting background functions, while the adaptive charging learns your routine (e.g. bed time and wakeup) and slow-charges your phone to 90%, only topping off at the very end, to reduce time at full charge, which can be stressful for a battery. Having used the XZ Premium for a year, I am confident in asserting that these technologies will have you feeling like your phone battery is just as fresh a year in as on the day you got it. CAMERA Yet again, a new generation of Sony phones brings a new generation of Sony hype for their camera tech. And while most years, this proves to be underwhelming, I have to say this year the hype is deserved. Sony claims its ""Bionz"" processing and high-ISO shooting significantly improves low-light performance. My testing has borne this out as true. The attached snap of my cat was taken at night, indoors, with only a dim lamp for light. The detail level is exceptional, and improves on my XZ Premium. Daylight snaps also show excellent detail, with significantly better post processing than Sony's prior efforts, by which I mean less noise and sharpening upon close ""pixel peeping"" inspection. Sony's superb burst modes and predictive capture are also present, which make this an exceptionally good choice for users with young kids (it's hard to get those little buggers to sit still!). Video has seen an upgrade to 4k HDR recording (1080p and 4k non-HDR are still options, of course). Super Slow-Motion at 960fps is available now in both 720p and 1080p (1080p being a first for smartphones). Unfortunately, predictive capture is not available on slow-mo, as it is on the Samsung S9. So you get better image quality but still a finicky trigger which makes it hard to slow down just the right moment. CONCLUSION At this price, I think this is a 4 star device. Sony keeps cranking out phones every six months, and the prices often drop precipitously within 3 months of release. So I would recommend waiting until this one is at or below 650. With that said, this is probably the best phone Sony has released in a long time. The camera is finally competitive with the very top tier of flagships, and the performance overall is superb.",53,"Sony"

"2596","B07B82VTX5",4,"false","I previously had the Xperia XZ, and I was hoping the XZ2 would be wider but it is slightly longer. The XZ2 is beautiful, but very slippery without a phone case, due to its rounded surface. Mine slipped off my desk the first day before my case arrived, because I sat it on some papers and it slid off due to the papers not being flat. My previous XZ was always hot and the battery barely lasted until I got home. I do notice the XZ2 phone also gets warm at times, but not to the same extent as the XZ and so far the battery life seems better. The phone froze on me today while trying to turn on Bluetooth, so that is a bit worrisome. But overall I like the phone. I love the speakers because when I play my music, I like to have my music loud when driving and Sony Xperia always has great speakers. The phone is responsive with plenty of storage and the camera is really great. The zoom is really awesome. You can take a picture and then zoom in on it after-the-fact, even.

"2597","B07B82VTX5",5,"false","The only real negative I have to say about this phone is how slick it is. It's so slick, I constantly dropped it because it just slipped out of my hand or slipped off whatever surface I put it on. If the surface wasn't flat, even the slightest slope would cause it to eventually slip off and fall to the ground. But i don't worry about it too much, since I always put a case on it anyways, which stops the slipping. The battery life lasts forever. If I leave it sitting on the counter doing nothing, it can last 3-4 days on a single charge. As for the OS and features, it's very similar to any other android phone.",3,"Sony"

"2599","B07B82VTX5",5,"false","I absolutely love this phone. I'm one of those people who's obsessed with gadgets and as such, phones are a big one for me. I'm a T-Mobile subscriber and I currently use a Galaxy S9+ as well as an iPhone 10. I was using a Note 8 which I loved, but T-Mobile let my upgrade to the S9 which has a better camera and in my case, I hadn't used the Note previously so it was a bit much for me. The XZ2 reminds me a lot of the Note 8, almost exactly the same width while being just a little shorter. I haven't had a Sony phone in a while, certainly not since the iPhone and Samsungs have gained popularity so I was curious about a few things. Transferring data was my biggest concern but fortunately, it's a lot easier than I thought. Even when I have moved things from Samsung to Samsung or Apple to Apple, a few settings are lost. The main things though, contacts, music, pictures, video, text messages, Wifi settings are all there. The Play store apps that you back up are also there. There are a few items that are missing and I had to re-enter some credentials, but by and large, I found the transfer to be no more or no less of an issue than I did when moving from a Galaxy S8 to a Note 8 or the Note 8 to the Galaxy S9. You will need to recreate your phone credentials, you'll need to set the biometrics if you choose to secure your phone that way as well. Banking apps such as Bank of America or USAA, which push you to using Biometrics need a walkthrough as well. What I mean is, the Bank of America app will come back, but just b/c you had it set up with biometrics before doesn't mean you can skip that step. The same with Android Pay. However all of these combined took me roughly 10 minutes to set up. The only things that were inconvenient were my crypto-currency wallets but that is something that should necessitate user involvement. Keep in mind I'm comparing this to both the S9+ and the iPhone X. I was completely impressed with the performance this has. Completely. It's fast, its quick, the display is superb and the camera is excellent. It fits very comfortably in your hand too. I have it paired with several accessories including Bang and Olufsen E8 buds, Motorola Verve + buds, a Samsung Gear 3, two other Android Wear watches and a Logitech keyboard. All of them were easy to set up and interact with it perfectly. Well, I have some small glitches with the Verve Plus buds but that's due to the buds and is reflected on each device I use. I personally find the keys on the display just a bit small, nothing problematic but they are a bit small. The screen display helps minimize any issue there and you can easily opt to use voice dictation for most things which minimize any issues you might have. The voice recognition is excellent and very responsive and like any phone of this caliber, there are many shortcuts and tricks to facilitate navigation. I'll update this post shortly with some pictures I took with the camera. I was quick to change from the Note 8 to the S9 b/c the camera was said to be much better, in reality, I noticed an improvement but in retrospect, I wouldn't have changed phones just for the camera. The camera on this phone rivals the one on the s9 and the video feed seems every bit as good if not better. I am as impressed as one can be with the video recording overall. Lastly, I've started using this to stream video. The A/V aspects of this device are big selling points and while it doesn't have Samsung's screen mirroring, there is an equivalent that will work on most newer televisions. You can pair with most newer ones and you can obviously connect through USB or Chromecast to other devices, all of which works splendidly. The two things you should be aware of however are covers and the charger. It comes with a small USB charger and it uses USB-C. If you haven't used a device with USB-C, be careful. It's a big improvement over USB-B but many cables will give you a 'slow charge' message. You need to use higher end cables to get it charging correctly and I've had problems with every cable I've bought that wasn't high end. This isn't unique to this phone, everything I've tried that uses C has the issue but you'll want to get another charging cable. I tried using some of the wireless charging stations I have and it didn't seem to work, I don't know if that's b/c the phone doesn't support it or b/c there was an issue with my chargers. I need to look that up but I can say that using my Belkin charging station or any of the Samsung/Apple wireless chargers doesn't seem to work. ( I guess I should have looked up whether or not it's supported and if so, what charger is needed before writing about it). I also had a little trouble finding a case. Starting with the Note 8, I found several really awesome cases, one, for instance, has a marquee display of the time. The S9 has cases that are totally transparent on the front but still flip back. They allow you to flip the case back without any interference on the side. I couldn't find a case for it at Office Depot or Best Buy, fortunately, I was able to find a few online. Those won't be a reflection on the phone and how well I like them will depend on the case obviously, but it's worth noting that you will probably need to look online for a case, at least for the time being. Other than that there's not much to say. It fits in your hand great. The sound is tremendous. The video is superb. The camera is top notch. It has the best performance of any phone I've tried or at worst ties the best of the best. And so far, the battery life is exactly what I want. I use it heavily in the day and I have been able to get away with charging it before I leave to work and when I get home, then at night. But that's with very heavy daily use.",15,"Sony"

I am not a big fan of the rounded back which makes it a little uncomfortable when using the phone on a flat surface.

I contacted Sony and was told, ""that option has been eliminated on this phone"". So the customers of only one of my business may text me. Actually, I spoke with my carrier. they tell me the texts are received by them and held until they can be delivered to a phone that receives texts.

But my experience has been so awful that it's only fair to warn people considering purchasing this phone. If you want the whole sordid story, just do a web search for ""Speaker problem followed by horrendous customer service."" Here's the Reader's Digest Condensed version. My phone worked great for a couple months. Then the speaker on it malfunctioned; this is a known issue with XZ2 devices. I called phone support and sent it in for repair. The tracking number shows Sony received it over 3 weeks ago. After a week passed from them receiving it, I hadn't heard anything. This made me nervous, so I called phone support to see if they could check my repair status (Sony does not allow US consumers to see their repair status online). And then, I got caught in the customer service version of the Bermuda Triangle. Actually, I take that back...that's not fair to the Bermuda Triangle. I called customer support at least 6 times over the past 2 weeks. Each time I have gotten a different story. At first, it was that they had no record of ever receiving my phone and accused me of not using the shipping label they sent me. I forwarded them the emails showing that I had used their shipping label and that they had, in fact, received the item. They promised to contact me within 48 hours with the repair status. They did not. Several similar phone calls followed over the next two weeks. Each time, I was promised that I would receive a status update by email within 24 to 48 hours. Each time, they broke that promise. And each time, the explanation as to where my phone was and why I couldn't get it was different. I don't say this lightly, but the stories they gave me were so inconsistent, that there's no way that I wasn't getting outright lied to on at least a couple of the calls. I tried chat support too and had similar experiences. It's been simply awful. I spent $800 on a phone and sent it to Sony for repair. They received it, but it seems to me they have lost it. And the customer service team has made no effort to make things right. I have used every available avenue to me to resolve this with Sony directly--phone and chat support plus online forum, asking to speak to supervisors, asking to put me in touch with the repair center directly, etc--and they apparently have no record of where my phone is and are unable to tell me when (if ever) I will get it back. I am going to be contacting my state attorney general and the BBB. But really the only way Sony will get the message is if people stop buying their phones until they improve their unfathomably bad customer service. UPDATE: Shortly after I wrote this, I contacted Sony's corporate headquarters in Japan (seriously) by email and told them of the situation. They forwarded it to the head of customer support in the US, and that person finally was able to give me an explanation of what was happening. Apparently, they ""misplaced"" my phone for a week or two. They had located it by the time the customer service head called me, but since I'd already been without my phone for a full month, they sent me a new phone in lieu of a repair. Apparently, they have some serious issues with their frontline US customer support team. Because they eventually resolved my issue, I upgraded this review from one star to two. I can't go higher because the ordeal was just so drawn-out and ridiculous. I plan to sell the new XZ2 on eBay when it arrives because I just don't want to have to deal with their customer service team if it breaks again.",16,"Sony"

I really like how this phone's back curves into my hand, so comfortable to hold and use. It has a premium weighty feel to it. I have missed having a dedicated camera button to quickly launch the camera app and take photos within a few seconds. Watching videos is great, like the stereo speakers and the fact that they are long and pretty hard to accidentally cover with my fingers. Also, something hard to cover with your fingers, the camera is lower and in the middle of the phone's back than my last several phones. Now the only thing so far that I really don't like but will probably get used to over time... the fingerprint sensor on the back is just to low, but it is very fast and accurate. I waited to get the phone until the price had dropped a bit since launch and think that the current $699 price is a good price for the Sony Xperia XZ2 because most other flagship phones in the $799-850 price range have 2k displays versus the 2160x1080p 18:9 display on the XZ2. So I'm glad it has dropped to $699 already.",1,"Sony"

"2610","B07B82VTX5",4,"false","In the summer of 2018, there are so many options out there for decent Android phones, it's hard to pick the ""best"", but the XZ2 is a real contender. I've owned the previous XZ and XZ Premium, as well as a OnePlus 5T, Samsung Galaxy S9+, and what was my daily driver, an iPhone X. The XZ2 may be at the top of my list. Here's why: Sony's launcher is so minimalist, you barely notice that you're not using pure Android. It's very responsive, and very flexible when it comes to making UI changes. The thoughtful touches that they've added (pulse rings, light customizations in settings, etc.) are useful, but also stay out of your way. In the previous generation XZ and in the XZ2, Sony is on the spot with updates. As of this writing (June 12, 2018) I've already got this month's Android security update. Speaking of updates, the XZ2 is also ready to go if you want to slap the Android P beta on it. I did, and... well, it's still beta. Relative to most mainstream phones on the market, it's great that you're not just waiting on basic updates (I'm looking at you, Samsung), but you can jump ahead and start using what's next on the horizon. The fingerprint scanner is probably the fastest I've ever used, but the placement is awkward to me. I keep hitting the camera lens. I really wish Sony had gone with an offset lens, or moved it up a half inch or so. And as much as I liked the physical shutter button for the camera, there were a number of times where I was concerned about dropping the phone, due to the somewhat awkward placement. Speaking of the camera, it's pretty decent. I don't know that I'd say it's as good as the S9+ or iPhone X (it isn't) but for casual photography, it's fine. I noticed most of the photos were neutral, to the point where I wasn't sure if the device was working overtime on image correction -- but if it was, the results didn't have a ""processed"" look to them. Of course, coming from several dual-lens cameras, I also noticed that I needed to be much more careful keeping the device still, to prevent blurry shots. Although you only get 64gb on board with the XZ2, I had no trouble at all adding my 200gb micro-SD card for added storage. Yes, you'll sacrifice dual-SIM capability for more memory, but I think most people in the US market are apt to only use one SIM anyway. Of course, I did use two SIMs for a while (AT&T and T-Mobile) and it was very interesting to do side-by-side network comparisons in places I normally visit. I had been considering leaving AT&T for T-Mobile, and picked up a prepaid SIM with 10gb of data, and found that in really excellent conditions, I could get 90mb down on T-Mobile where I was getting not quite 10 from AT&T. In other areas, the differences were much less drastic. Either way, reception was very good, though areas with marginal coverage had more of a tendency to drop to ""no carrier"" than with my iPhone X or S9+. Not to the extent that I wouldn't use this phone, but if you live or work in a one-bar area, the XZ may be problematic for you. One weird maybe-just-me thing that I wanted to point out here: This phone is slippery, and I hate TPU, polycarbonate, and OtterBox-type cases, which seem to be mostly what's available on Android devices -- that, or leather cases with annoying flaps, card holders, and so on. I often fall back on my iPhone because the size and genuine Apple leather cases feel so great together. I hadn't quite replicated that until now, and it was with the XZ2 phone combined with a TETDED phone case. I opted for the saddle brown color, and it really changed this phone for me. Every bit as comfortable as the iPhone experience, and I wasn't worried about drops or scratches. No disclosure necessary here, I found the case on my own, and paid full price for it. Just a friendly tip. Coming from Sony, you'd expect the speakers to be decent -- and they are. Probably the best I've heard from any Android device (excepting for Motorola phones that have the JBL MotoMod snap-on). The Dynamic Vibration, though, is really dumb. It follows the bass in music, mostly. In games, it's like playing with a broken rumble module. After an hour, tops, I turned it off. Similarly, you'd expect the display to be great, and I can't deny that it is rather nice. It doesn't pop like the S9+, but offers more accurate colors, and the digitizer is much less prone to picking up hovering fingers as the S9+. Very easy to view indoors and outdoors, though I found that prior to the last update or two, the dynamic brightness seemed to cause a flicker indoors. I was concerned that I had received a phone with a bad display when I first got it. If you notice a flicker, turning it off should be your first step. All in, this is a really nice phone, with only a few shortcomings. For the price, I'm not sure it's a must-buy, but I'd definitely choose it over the S9+, and it would be a contender over the new OnePlus 6 (mostly if you care about installing things from the Amazon App Store, which OxygenOS still seems to have trouble with at the time of this writing). I like it enough to put my iPhone X up for sale, which I think is saying something. The downside -- and this is a big one -- is that the XZ2 Premium is going to be out any day now. And at the top of the list of XZ2 Premium features, you'll find a dual-lens camera, and 4K display. So at the current price, I'd probably avoid buying the XZ2, when the XZ2 Premium may not cost much more. Once the XZ2 Premium hits stores and the price of the XZ2 drops, this will be an incredible phone at a midrange price.",4,"Sony"

"2612","B07B82VTX5",4,"false","I am an owner of the previous version of this phone. I use it for offline / WiFi photography. Still has an SD card (yeah!) . OK, it is a little slow . . . Speedy on installing apps and rebooting. Less fast installing update. Faster than my Pixel 2 but a lot. Update pushing on startup - download quickly, but take awhile to install. (Not sure if same or different from Pixel 2). New wireless power feature Uses standard USB-C now Now has fingerprint reader; last Sony model didn't. “Screenshot” option using single power button-push and a screen label. Really nice for photos. I can never get the Pixel to do this right! Placement of icons odd… go into single Apps screen first Version 8 swipe up vs. X app closure not present Camera a bit of a disappointment vs. Pixel 2 - See Trusted Review Uses Snapdragon 845 and 4GB of RAM. See review by Alastair Stevenson Trusted Reviews for details. Camera: Video capturing is good and this version adds a 4K HDR recording option, and fast with up to 960fps even at 1080p. Low light camera performance is not so great compared to the Pixel, which excels at it. I am not a fan of the haptic features. They seemed to be engaged unintentionally at times. (Blame Google and Apple for these semi-innovations.) It is a slippery phone. I found it sliding off the desk now and then unexpectedly -- when usual friction tends to be enough to prevent that. Headphone jack is through the USB-C, but at least there is that option. I don’t really like bluetooth at the point in its evolution, at least not as much as the phone makers like it. The Android port is a reasonable one, with little extra bloat. Updates take a bit longer than Google’s, and lag theirs a bit on install (an unfair comparison), but not too bad. Mostly it’s pretty close in quality to the Pixel 2, but let's be clear: the Pixel 2 is a really great phone -- and camera. I’d recommend the XZ2 as a decent backup phone, especially for important video or use when there’s no WiFi or cell service (e.g., nature work). As I write this, Sony is talking up their next model to supplant this one. Planned obsolescence at work.",NA,"Sony"

"2614","B07B82VTX5",4,"false","Think of your trusty childhood friend or family dog. You know neither is perfect, but you're happy to have them in your life. The Sony Xperia XZ2 isn't a phone that is at the top echelon of Android feature phones. It doesn't have a 'notch', doesn't have the larger-than-life screen, nor a camera set up that does a gazillion megapixels, in dark light, during a Soviet invasion. The XZ2 however, is quite good at almost everything. It has Android 9.0, wireless charging, top of the line Snapdragon, really good camera and a very good screen. Oh, and the battery life has been INCREDIBLE. To better the features of the XZ2, you need to pay $700-1000 for the likes of a Samsung S9, Google Pixel 3, OnePlus, etc... I wasn't going to pay that much. The other choices at prices below $500 are Chinese phones from Huawei, Blu or Xaiomi. I just wasn't going to go there due to security concerns and reports of random ads being served on the devices. In about a year or two, I will likely tire of the XZ2. Sony will likely not keep up with providing OS updates, the battery will likely lose some of its storage, and I may desire a larger screen phone as my eyes continue to age. Until then, I'll be more than content to have the XZ2 as my daily phone companion. Even if I lust after some new feature phone, there's a good chance that nothing on the market will be the value that I find in this phone.",1,"Sony"

"2618","B07B82VTX5",5,"true","Note: I only do TL/DR reviews, oriented toward other techs. I'm not a gamer (and indeed have never downloaded or played a game on a smartphone since the pre-iPhone period). I am a business user (and have provided IT support for over 30 years). So if you just want the quick exec' summary review impression: ""there's no reason at all not to own an XZ2 regardless of the reviews you've read"". Moreover, Sony pretty much provides a superior ""phone experience"" which offers unexpected and under-appreciated-by-reviewers benefits to Sony phone owners over the long run. I ""appreciate"" Sony in the same way I ""appreciated"" Nokia back in the pre-Microsoft-purchase days. History... I purchased an XZ1 compact (my first Sony) in Nov 2017 - close to when they were released - after Microsoft confirmed they were ending support for Windows Mobile, and I felt forced to move back to Android. I'd tried using an iPhone (5s) for a couple of months... but the UI was just so dated (compared to Windows Mobile), I couldn't get past the step back in time (both the iPhone and 'Droid UI were so dated by comparison, it was like having to step back in time to Windows 3.1 lol). But I did like having a smaller form factor of the iPhone 5s, so I looked for a 'Droid equivalent, and the XZ1 compact was the only one even close with spec's that I could accept. Fast forward to 2019. My wife had *never* liked the mid-range Huawei 8 plus she bought in 2016 (her previous phone was a Nokia 1020). But she really didn't want to pay for a ""flagship level"" device. I'd already been kicking around the notion that I needed a bigger display (swyping on a small display is prone to constant errors). So. I offered to give her my XZ1 if she'd pay half of my $300 (or less) budget for an equivalent used Sony (XZ1, XZ2, or XZ3) with larger display. No-brainer for her (and which she's been entirely happy about as she's used the XZ1c), and ""opportunity"" for me to slightly upgrade (and try out a larger display). ---------------------- Sony... After having spent almost two years with a Sony, I'm a brand fan-boy. I like the timely and constant updates (the XZ1c came with 'Droid 8 and was upgraded to 'Droid 9 in a timely fashion, with numerous security patches intervening... and I expect will be version updated to 'Droid 10 during my wife's tenure). The minimal issues (none I can recall). The obvious quality of engineering and manufacturing control. And Sony's ongoing customer support via their ""features updates"" (they constantly have free offers, and low-price offers). Actually, pretty much every-d@mn-thing about the brand; Sony spoils you lol. Reviewers simply miss how important those things are when you keep a phone for a few years... so even though I read the reviews, I have my own opinions and experience which tempers the reviewers. ---------------------- XZ2 features... I'm not going to delve into the usual specs. At this point (June 2018) the XZ2 is already a year past phone release (April 2018) as I write this, so the phone's general specs are available all over the Internet. So my review will only address my impressions of some of the features that had me a bit worried from the many reviews I read prior to purchase. ---------- 1. Slipperyness. It really truly is. Slippery, I mean. It couldn't be any more slippery if it was live and wiggling (and when it buzzes, it DOES wiggle lol). But... how does that matter when the first thing you're going to do after buying it is putting it in a case? And how exactly, is that a distraction by comparison with every other glass back phone out there lol? Ding ding ding. Note: if you aren't going to put it in a case 1) the curvature is lovely in your hand (the feel in use is superb), and 2) for gawd's sake be careful when you're holding it, and 3) be mindful that it *wiggles* even on a flat surface. That curve and that glass are definitely ""gravity sensitive""; it will find minor slopes you would've sworn couldn't exist. ---------- 2. The fingerprint scanner location... which I was concerned with (from the countless reviews I read)... just isn't that big a deal. In my case (I have smaller hands), the mid-longitudinal-axis location is a *plus* (and not the ""poor location"" practically every user complained about). How you hold your phone in hand, and how you ""slide"" your finger onto the scanner, and how large your paws are... which quite obviously varies user-to-user... means that you can (and probably should) just ignore every reviewer's complaint about the Sony engineers' placement of the fingerprint scanner mid-phone on the longitudinal access. And actually... I. Like. Where. The. Scanner. Is. Period. LOL. ... because my index finger naturally reaches there (small hand: large phone: two hand w/ LH top hold and bottom RH quadrant scan reach... I hold the phone in use in my left hand). And seriously, if you're reaching from a side-quadrant hold (i.e., across the narrow width of the phone) to scan your fingertip, you have to scrunch your finger at the joints anyways, right? And aren't there *always* slight variations in scanner location phone-to-phone, brand-to-brand anyways? Whatever. You'll get used to the mid-phone location... and might find you prefer it. I did. (And the first few times you use it, you may end up wondering what the particular fuss was all about.) Full disclosure: the Sony XZ1 I came from used the *excellent* finger scanner located on the side on/off button. And EVERY other scanner location on EVERY other phone is sub-standard compared to that side-button location. Well, ""IMHO"" lol. ---------- 3. Smoothness. The XZ1 came with a Snapdragon 835. The XZ2's Snapdragon 845 is superior. Call the qualitative difference ""smoothness"". The XZ1 was never laggy... but the XZ2 just seems ""smoother"" doing the same things; there's not a noticeable ""performance"" difference in day-to-day use, but there's a ""something-something"" difference in feel and impressions. (Or maybe it's just me, and maybe it's just the increase screen size. Dunno.) ---------- 4. Features. There's no difference between the XZ1 and XZ2 in daily use. Sony doesn't load up their UI with worthless crap, and they do a minimal app pre-install, period. No complaints. ---------- 5. Microsoft Launcher, Your Phone, and W10... offer almost perfect integration on the XZ2 (and the XZ1 before it) with Android (the integration improved with the release if Android 9 over Android 8). As a business focused tech user, I've long since grown accustomed to - and indeed, need - my phone to seamlessly connect to all my devices (which are almost all W10 centric at this point), and the XZ2 does this brilliantly. Note: And kudos to Microsoft for fully supporting Android connectivity, after making the decision to abandon Window Mobile. At this point, the only thing lacking in Android is the UI; features-wise, its finally holding its own. (Yeah, I know about Squares and such... but skinning Android with tiny squares isn't fooling anyone that the UI doesn't suck-by-comparison with the finer touches in the old Windows Mobile OS.) ---------- 6. Updates... deserving of another mention. Sony update policy isn't specific to the XZ2 in particular, but still may be THE reason to buy any Sony phone, by preference... especially for sophisticated business oriented techies. There's nothing you won't find you prefer about Sony's continued and prompt update policies. Much appreciated. ---------- 7. T-Mobile. Although the XZ2 doesn't support VoLTE (like the XZ1 compact did), I haven't noticed the lack thereof... which I kind of expected. (We don't have a great signal at our location, but we do have a CellSpot LTE.) That might be due to the larger antenna's in the larger phone? Or to the glass back? Or ""who knows"". Anyways, they're fine on TMob'. ---------- 8. Listening. The XZ-series Sony have dual, screen facing speakers. Worthy of notice and mention: they provide actual stereo separation at ample volume for in-close listening. ---------- 9. Earbuds. I don't use 'em, so as far as I'm concerned not having an audio jack on the XZ2 just means one less lint trap lol. But my wife does use 'em, and she appreciates the audio jack on the XZ1. If I used 'em, I'd likely prefer blue tooth anyways. ---------- 10. Accessory: screen protector. Both the XZ1 and the XZ2 have this slightly concave (i.e., they aren't perfectly flat) screen surface which isn't condusive to tempered glass screen protection. Use film instead (if you must) for best fitment. (All tempered glass review averages are three stars or less... it's just Sony has concave screens.) That said, these ""fit"" (and I use the term ""fit"" in the widest possible interpretation) as well as you can probably hope for until they have bendable glass, and includes two glass screens: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FNZ3WPP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ---------- 11. Accessory: case 1. I like ultra-thin design cases, and so, for now, I'm using the Anccer case available on Amazon for $12, here https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BD5R6H6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. ---------- 12. Accessory: case 2. In general, my experience is that Ringke smartphone cases simply offer the best protection in a sub-Otter-box-protection design. Depending upon how I feel about the Ancerr after a while in daily use, I also bought an XZ2 Ringke case from Amazon for $11, here https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BYTLYQD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ---------------------- Final thoughts... I bought my listed-as, ""used-very good"", XZ2 from an Amazon vendor for slightly less than three benjamins delivered. A screamin' deal for a one generation old flagship. In use, I've already found I actually *do* prefer the larger screen. I was pleasantly surprised to find the fingerprint scanner - whose location I was prepped to not like - was almost perfect for my hands. And I unconditionally recommend Sony in general, and the XZ2 in particular.",2,"Sony"

"2636","B07DF9R73K",4,"false","The Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium is one of my favorite phones I’ve ever used. Almost everything about it is wonderful – expect one major thing. This phone is not certified by T-Mobile. And this is heartbreaking really, because if you want to enjoy a T-Mobile certified Xperia smartphone, you are going to have to downgrade back to the Xperia XZ1 Compact. Only then will you have access to critical technologies such as voice over LTE and WI-FI calling. But otherwise the XZ2 Premium truly is a premium experience, even when compared to the other two phones in the XZ2 lineup – the XZ2 Compact and the XZ2. Take the Dynamic Sound functionality, for example. This technology allows haptic feedback for audio signals such as music or movies. On the regular XZ2 this functions mostly as a gimmick – it is binary, meaning it is either vibrating or not. It’s more annoying than anything. But on the XZ2 Premium it functions much more like the Dual Shock 2 controller on the Playstation 4. There are many different levels of vibration, and there is a gradient of haptic feedback that eases in and out. It makes a world of difference and is a very cool experience. The 2160 x 3840 4K HDR TRILUMINOS display is a sight to behold. And while the pixel density may be overkill (the screen resolution far surpasses the visual acuity of the human eye), technology such as the Dynamic Contrast Enhancer ensures an optimal viewing experience in any ambient environment. The brightness and contrast change slowly and are so subtle that you will not know it is happening. There is never a reason to manual adjust. In either a dark environment or in bright sunlight, the screen is readily visible while the human pupil stays relaxed. It’s amazing technology for sure. And no review would be complete without describing the remarkable Motion Eye Dual camera with ISO51200! This camera is amazing and far exceeds the (already amazing) camera on the regular XZ2. The dual camera technology allows stunning monochrome photographs that are impossible to achieve with a post process filter, and close up shots with the Bokeh effect have to be seen to believed. I’m blown away, and I was already impressed with the XZ2 technology! It’s all here, 960 super slow motion, predictive capture, autofocus burst, HDR, 4K resolution. I’m convinced, this is the best camera technology in the phone industry. The microSDXC expansion slot is worth mentioning. You can either have dual SIMs, or expanded memory, but not both. If opting for the expanded memory, watch for the speed rating of the card. Buy the fastest you can find, not the largest. Read/write speeds will be critical for 4K HDR video capture. You’ll want something that can sustain 100 Megabytes per second. And unlike the XZ1 lineup, the XZ2 fingerprint scanner has not been deactivated in the North American market. And it works really well - not only to unlock the phone but also with several third party applications. There are a few disappointments, such as no auxiliary port for an audio cable. For a phone this size, there is really no excuse to require a USB-C dongle for cabled audio out. And the short shelf life before the announced release of the XZ3 is really surprising too. But the Xperia XZ2 Premium does so much right! The Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor gives this phone the performance of most laptops, while still offering a power efficiency that allows the 3540 mAh battery to last well into the second day of heavy use. The High-Resolution Audio is on par with many large portable speakers and can easily fill a room with satisfying acoustics. And at 236 grams of weight, it really isn’t that heavy for something that provides so much. Highly recommended. The only hesitation is the lack of certification on the T-Mobile network. And this missing technology (no VoLTE/WiFi Calling) keeps the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium from the perfect score.",5,"Sony"
"2637","B07DF9R73K",4,"false","This has been a great phone, though I had to activate it on a network I don't normally use so I can test it out. Verizon said it would not work on their network. I activated it on At&t. First, up front, let me say, if you get this phone, put a screen protector on it. Hands down, no matter what. Even if you are the type to not use one and you take care of your phone well like me, you will want one on this phone. Brand new, out of the box, the guy at the store was putting a sim card in it and sat it on the table face down for a moment, not even a rough table, once I had the phone in my hand I saw scratches on the screen. Scratches that do not buff out. They are small, you can't see them when looking at the screen while on, but you can see them when the screen is off easy or when some glare is on the screen when it is lit. This bummed me out that this happened. I can probably spin my pixel 2 xl on that same table like a top and nothing would happen to it, so yeah, bummed me out. Anyways, I digress, if you do use screen protectors and cases then you should be good. I really enjoyed this phone a lot. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. With 4k content off youtube over wifi it is surprising how much nicer it is than most phones. Notice I said over wifi? Yeah, 4k content over at&t's network buffers a lot. Enough that you won't want to watch 4k when not on wifi. Even when the videos are not in 4k they still look great on this screen. Another plus to me on this phone is the aspect ratio is normal instead of the trend to go taller and skinnier for phones so they look bigger but can still be held. People are saying it makes the phone to big to hold in the hand and I disagree, at least in my hands it feels great. The only thing I find perplexing about the design is the bubbled back, it doesn't set flat on any surface, it sits on the middle of itself as the entire back is rounded. This makes it weird to set down on some surfaces as it tends to slide. Usage of the phone itself is pretty close to stock android with some tweeks. I really like that they stuck close to the android os as I have been using pure android phones for a long time and this made it easy to navigate this phone. Battery life has been great throughout its usage as well. All in all I would say, if you are into big phones this is a nice one to have. I would just plan on putting a screen protector on it right away. And I mean, take it out of the box, apply screen protector then set it up.",3,"Sony"

"2641","B07DF9R73K",5,"false","I love this phone! The Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium is the best phone I`ve ever had and renews my  view of Sony products. This wonderful piece of technology features a dual rear camera 19 Mega Pixels while the front is 13 MP, 4K HDR recording and amazing quality photo resolution. It has 64 GB internal memory (of which 12 are used out of the box for the OS).  The built in speaker is great, but no surprise considering Sony`s audio has never really been a let down on any product I have had from them. It has a dual sims and can also take an extra micro sd card for additional memory. With 6GB of Ram and the latest Qualcomm snapdragon 845 octacore, it makes for a snappy, speedy and smooth experience when you polish it off with the new Android Oreo OS. It doesn't come with too much bloatware, and what it does come with is minimal yet practical. There is no audio jack port, but it does have an adapter (also supplied with) to fit in the USB-C port to add one and a decent pair of headphones as well.) The phones bluetooth revision is 5.0 and is not perfect but tolerable. My problem with it is that although the signal is strong, it crackles loudly when you get too far out of range and unlike the Android Nougat, the OS has no indicater for the battery level of the connected bluetooth device (or at least I couldn`t find one). The call quality is superb and crystal clear over even on wifi  aside from all the latest signal supports (not sure about 5G data yet) It boasts to be water resistant, however, I will not test this theory, however, it does give an alert message when water (in my case humidity) gets into the charging port. The battery is 3540 maH and is supposed to be smart charge , Qnovo adaptive and has a stamina feature. On basic use it seems to charge slower than I expected and the battery did seem to deplete faster than I would have imaged with just basic browsing and listening to music, I just write that off as my fault because I am still exploring this magnificent hardware. The button layout is fashioned for comfort, more oriented for use by the left hand (or so it seems to me), while the right side is more for scrolling . I`m not especially fond of this or the layout as I found it rather prone to slipping out of the hand if not handled with care. These placements are awkward in my opinion because a camera snap, power and volume up and down is a bit inconvenient for a righty and takes some getting used to. The display is 5.8 inches (total dimensions 6.2 inches) and the weight is on the heavier side (8.2 oz). The body is sleek, perhaps a bit too much so. I strongly advice getting a case for this device immediately to minimize risks of it slipping from your grip. Every day I learn something new about this phone and that`s one of the best parts for me. There is not enough cons about this phone to discourage recommendation; in fact, quite the opposite, The price point is a tad steep though no more so than other high-end phones I've examined that are not nearly as good as this on, including the ridiculously over-priced one named for a piece of fruit. I suggest you go for it. If this particular top of the line model is too expensive for you it's worth exploring one of its less expensive incarnations with similar features if not all the bells and whistles of this one. In the final analysis, though, this phone crushes the competition.",3,"Sony"
"2642","B07DF9R73K",4,"false","Like all my reviews, this is coming at a product from a regular person's view. I don't know anything about the little behind the screens minor details. I am going to tell you my experiences with it. I was coming off the iphone 6 plus so a little background on where I am coming from. My first reaction when I first picked up the phone was...wow this thing is heavy. I am not saying hard to pick up, but it's definitely not as light as the other cell phones on the market. It threw me off immediately. It's also really thick. The other thing that surprised me was the amount of bezel there was. When phones are now trying to get away from them, this one has stayed with it. Two odd choices right off the bat. It's not a deal breaker, but aesthetically the weight and look not being modern...it's both a weird thing to have. In fact the differences other then weight between my iphone 6 and this were negligible. This is a 4K display so the picture will look very clear when watching movies. It was very interesting to see how different, even if in little details movies could be when looking at this screen. There is a 13MP camera in the front and a 19MP in the back. I took pictures from both directions and they came in clear and crisp. You can also record in 4K HD video, so it's going to look especially great on this phone. Even better then phone has a dedicated photo button, and you can use the volume buttons as an on the fly zoom button. If you are looking for a great camera on your phone, this is one you shouldn't dismiss. This has 64GB of memory inside it as well as being able to add a microSD card if that's not enough room. There is a fingerprint scanner on the back which was placed in the middle. It was a little odd in placing but nothing I couldn't adjust to. There is no headphone jack, but that's pretty standard now a days. It does come with an adaptor to turn your usb into a headphone jack, but I always find those unwieldy. It does come with earphones but those were aux plug in type, so if you will need to use that adaptor in order to use them. They were fine. I did like the vibrations we got when pushing a button. It really felt like I had pressed an actual button, it's something I never had on my iphone 6 plus and I always wished I did. I found it kept my missed letters in a text at a minimum since I knew when I missed one. It's funny I am waiting so long to actually talk about the phone part of this smart phone. It's honestly the part I use the least. I use T-Mobile and the connection was just fine. It worked just as I hoped and I didn't have any dropped calls. Battery life was good. It was even better if you factor in the 4K HD video the screen was putting out. It had to do more then most phones out there and it held up well to keep a charge all day. Plus you can do wireless charging with it. The Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium was impressive. The screen on it was beautiful and could do 4K HD video without a problem. It did have some issues like the bulk and weight of it, and the lack of a headphone jack was disappointing (if not unfortunately standard). The camera was near perfect in my opinion. I liked the dedicated shutter button and the volume used as zoom was very useful. My issue with it is the price. Is this as good as the newest Iphone or Samsung phone? It depends on what you are putting it up against. I would wait for this to go on sale, then pick it up. With the amazing screen and camera this will be a great deal one day.",4,"Sony"
"2643","B07DF9R73K",4,"false","Sony has once again put out a trend setting phone. The smartphone market is a very difficult one to navigate, much like the car industry. Sony is kind of like Mercedes/BMW, Apple like Audi, and Samsung Toyota/Lexus, HTC maybe like Honda. They all have intended audiences they target. Sony will not have the volume like Samsung or Apple, because Samsung caves to the carriers, and Apple has a loyal non-tech following. Sonys are a premium device, occupying the upscale end of the smartphone market, quality built, upscale design, and precision performance. I was a real big fan of the original Z line, in particular the Z ultra, a 6.4 in 16x9 screen that was so thin it replaced any need for a tablet, yet mobile enough to carry around without feeling the bulk. I think if the XZ2 Premium has a down fall, it would be the sheer thinkness, and weight making it noticeable to carry. The Z ultra was easy to carry yet had the largest screen on a smartphone. It was unfortunate that Sony's feedback from customers all pointed to the screen being too large, but I think that was only a particular segment of the users, and Sony didn't ask the right segment. Now I've been a user of just about every kind of phone, starting with the HTC, Samsung, Google devices, Apple, Motorola, and the latest Essential PH-1. As for Sony I've had the Sony Xperia Z, Z1s, Z2, Z3, Z Ultra, Z5, Z5 Premium, XZ, XZ Premium, the XA2 Ultra as a backup for a month, and finally the XZ2 Premium. So, I have a lot of experience with Sony devices. So I'm going to jump right into what I think were hits and misses with the new XZ2 Premium Hits n Miss: 1. 4K screen- while the display is fantastic, Sony should've gone a bit larger on the display, like the XA2 Ultra, with thinner bezels. On a $1000 premium phone, that should be achievable. The 4K and HDR is all great, but because there is so little 4K content out there, it is truly a waste, and I would've appreciated a OLED 2K screen like on the XZ3, would have proved to be better utilization for consumers in general. 2. size - there are many ways to get size to be manageable even if it's more than 6 in. Z Ultra was proof. I think the added pressure to perform, Sony got scared and didn't want to take a chance to further improve on a very successful design in the Z Ultra. 3. Camera- Hit for certain. It boasts the best low light camera/video on the market. No need to add to that. This is a real camera phone with some serious low light capabilities. If you want to be able to capture all those missed lower light situations in life, then this is the phone for you, no other. 4. Battery - is simply ok, now that we have quick charge, battery longevity isn't so critical, so I think considering everything else Sony packed into this phone, the battery, weight, and bulk was a decent balance, although I must say bulk is a bit on the large side. It is even heavy to hold in one hand where I have never had this problem with any other phone. This is the heaviest phone I've every come across. 5. Software/interface - Sony has the best software/firmware stability of any phone on the market, as ranked by a report I saw a year ago. I struggle to remember where I came across, but having owned so many Sony smartphones, literally every model, as I change phones every year, if not 6 months, I can confirm it is rock solid, and updates are improving in quick release dates after Google's own firmware release, so a big + and thank you to Sony for listening. 6. 16x9 vs 18x9 battle- I have to admit that I'm on Sony's side to say 16x9 is a plus. First it is the standard ratio for all 4K multimedia content used in theaters. 18x9 makes it easier to hold, and manufacturers claiming larger screen sizes without actually increasing usability in any meaningful way. I've seen the long long Samsung phones, while they say it's 6.4 in., but acutal usable is no different than a 5.8 in, and all the space wasted top and bottom, and when you view video content, you have massive blank black bars on both sides. How's that useful or usable??? The average consumers are so easy to trick. Who says 18x9 is the new standard?? and why?? is that good for consumers. Trust me, it's better for phone makers because they can now charge you more money for the bigger screen, make you want to upgrade, without giving you much in the way of substance. After the Nokia era, Sony seem to have taken its place in making the best phone hardware, and continuing sensible innovation. Samsungs tend to look good on paper and specs. but in reality, it looks very good on the outside, but inside is where you'll find corners cut. Remember there is no free lunch. For the massive amounts of money they spend on advertising and marketing, that costs has to come from somewhere. Nokia and Sony phones tend to hold up much longer than Samsungs, Samsung tends to be end of life in about 2 years, something gives up, either phone, or internals. That is experience, not opinion. Summary. It is a bit bitter sweet for me, after using the XZ2 Premium for a week. One one hand I love the innovation, and camera performance, but the sheer bulk and weight of the phone is troubling. It weighs on you day in day out. I've now have kinda gotten use to it, but I would have much preferred doing this with a larger screen and reduced thickness. The Z ultra was at a stunning 6.4mm thick, and the XZ2 Premium at 11.9mm, what is Sony thinking anyway. Maybe packing all that fancy camera technology isn't necessary and maybe making a camera centric line, media line, business line, mid-end phone lines would make more sense. Not every user will opt for a lowlight camera capability, and some of us want the thin large media screens. Hope you're listening Sony. Additional Thoughts, after having used the phone for a couple months, I've noticed the new design is weaker on signal reception. I'm in SoCal, and the same exact area, my previous XZPremium gets better reception than the XZ2, and this isn't just isolated to T-Mobile network, but also 5Ghz wireless wifi reception. I've found it oddly concerning, 2.4Ghz bandwidth is fine. So when I'm in my garage, I will loose 5Ghz fast wifi, and have to switch to much slower 2.4Ghz, i'm talking from 200M down to 50M ish. I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing this. This has been true on all 3 XZ2P, so I'm thinking it's not a isolated phone issue. I'm also noticing much lower microSD card performance, I can't even get anywhere close to U3 rated speed of 100m read, 100m write, instead, i'm getting about 30-40m read, and 18M write, that means I'll have trouble recording 4K on external SD, not sure if Sony has a firmware update to fix this. Definitely shouldn't be happening on a $1000 phone for certain.",3,"Sony"

"2648","B07DF9R73K",3,"true","I'll spare you the introduction and jump straight to it. The phone itself is great! But not Awesome. First, the camera. Very good quality, as expected from Sony. The main selling point, however, is the low-light function with a high ISO. Well, to no one's surprise, the XZ2P can take the pictures in low light...but...the are very grainy. Too much in fact, that it might not be worth using it for low light shots after all, but that's just my opinion. Second, the screen. It's a beautiful 4K HDR display that only Sony can produce. The maximum brightness I'd say is on par with the XZP from last year. One issue though, at least for me, is the (SVM) Super Vivid Mode. On the previous XZP, the SVM worked wonderfully! With good color saturation. This time around though, the colors do pop slightly more, but my complaint is on the blacks. The images and video's blacks get so saturated that you can't see anything! You literally have to switch it back to Standard mode to enjoy anything that has shadows or dark scenes, and thus, fixes the dark issues, but the colors look washed out. I hope Sony fixes this in a update. Third and fourth: NO HEADPHONE JACK! and the Fingerprint Scanner is quite annoying to reach since its not placed where your finger would naturally reach. (User experience may vary) Lastly, battery life. This might be an issue with my model, but who knows. From 100% to 67% in about 50 minutes... Watching YouTube... in 480p... Bluetooth, NFC off and screen brightness around 75% Now, I'm no tech expert, but to me, I'd say my battery should have at least been at 80% since I watched less than an hour of video and only 2 apps running in the background. Not looking good Sony. Overall, its a good phone, but certainly not for the $1000 price tag. My suggestions to Sony: 6.4in or more on the size for the Premium model. Like the Z Ultra Either remove the 4K screen or find a way to improve battery life. Bring back the headphone Jack! Make it bezeless, but only on the with! Like on your XA Ultra device! Move the fingerprint scanner back on the power button like on the XZ Premium. And just quality of life improvements, like the Super Vivid Mode fix etc. P.S I'm not asking to revolutionize or think of brand new product. In fact, all my suggestions come from Sony phones that I have!",16,"Sony"
"2649","B07DF9R73K",5,"true","This is my first Sony phone, and honestly... I think I'm in love. The phone is powerful, which is something you'd expect from a flagship phone, but it has a very sleek yet non-flashy look to it. The smooth glassy appearance isn't just for looks; the phone is covered in gorilla glass 5, making it strong and (hopefully) resistant to the bumps and bruises of everyday life. Further, the phone comes with a water resistance rating, so you don't have to panic every time the phone gets in the rain. The XZ2 Premium sports some of Sony's top of the line image sensors, allowing it to take clean, colorful photos and video. Further, the phone comes loaded with minimal bloatware; there are a few Sony specific apps, but I didn't find anything too obnoxious, and I was pleasantly surprised by a 3D scanning app, since 3D printing is one of my hobbies. Finally, battery life is decent, especially for how powerful the phone is, but it's nothing that'll wow you. Anyway, enough rambling, let's break the phone down: PROS: -Powerful processor -Accelerometer and gyroscope -Powerful cameras, with dual cameras for better low-light photos -Stereo sound -A dedicated button for quick camera activation CONS: -A bit hefty -Extremely slippery, but a phone case fixes this -While has a lot of options, some options for exactly what you want may be missing",2,"Sony"

After nearly 3 hours of Sony security updates, it even upgraded itself to Android 9.0! I really like Sony's streamlined UI, the SwiftKey keyboard (other keyboards feel really slippy to me, especially Apple's), Xperia's system sounds, and DSEE HX enhancements for music. Best smartphone audio that requires no adjusting or fiddling around. All of that is why I love Sony phones, except... it can only call in 3G. Sony phones (with only 2 exceptions I can find) are not certified for VoLTE or other ""premium"" services like wi-fi or video calling by any major carrier in the US. AT&T supposedly has the best 3G support so I used them for this phone and the XA2 Plus I had before. Overall, the XZ2 has much better connectivity than the XA2 Plus (possibly because that one is an international model) and doesn't need to be manually switched back to an LTE network profile after every single call. No problems with landlines, but cell calls had unusually low volume even when cranked up to maximum and were muffled almost beyond recognition. Honestly I'm impressed I was able to converse with one of my friends, even though he said I was breaking up badly a few times. On the iPhone X I used to have and the LG V35 I have now, the same guy is crystal clear on VoLTE. I ended up returning this lovely and powerful phone that doesn't call well. I've read this is all Sony's fault for refusing to go through the carriers' certification process and they seem to be focusing more on Europe and Asia anyway. I still really like their designs and UI and can't help but wonder if the Xperia 1 has the same call issues...",1,"Sony"

"2671","B07DF9R73K",4,"false","It’s the phone that I have been waiting for…Sony’s XPERIA XZ2 PREMIUM. You may be wondering? Didn’t Sony release an XZ2 and the XZ2 Compact? What is the difference with the premium? The XZ2 Premium is 5.8″ and offers 16:9 4K HDR (3840 x 2160 pixels) vs. the XZ2 which offers 5.7″ 18:9 Full HD+ HDR. In fact, the premium offers an incredible 759 pixels-per-inch density and is the first phone that can display 4K HDR content and record 4K HDR content. Both offer 19MP Motion Eye but the Premium has a dual which offers 12MP for the main rear camera. While the front camera offers 13MP selfie 3D capture while the XZ2 offers only 5MP selfie 3D capture. And for those who are very hardcore when it comes to adjusting colors, Sony includes its TRILUMINOS technology as well! The other differences is that it comes with 6GB ram/64GB internal memory and is expandable to 400GB Micro SDXC, while the XZ2 comes with a 4GB ram/64GB internal memory and expandable to 400 GB Micro SDXC. In terms of battery, it comes with a 3540 mAh/QI Wireless Charging and the XZ2 comes with a 3180 mah/QI Wireless Charging. Outside of that, both offer S-Force Front Surround Sound, Android Oreo 8.0/Dual Sim and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and fingerprint sensor. But does that make the SONY XPERIA worth the $999.99 price tag vs. the $661.49 price tag of the XZ2? I think that it comes down to whether or not 4K HDR is important to you. For me, I prefer shooting video in 4K, I love the ability to shoot in 4K HDR and that I can view 4K HDR content. The display also offers a white pixel for better candela while reducing power consumption. I also like a camera that can work in low light situations and with the ISO 12800, that makes the camera for indoor photography even more important for me. But that’s a question many will need to decide…to go 4K or not? If you are posting videos on social media, then definitely consider the upgrade to 4K! While I unboxed the SONY XPERIA XZ2 PREMIUM smartphone, I felt the look was elegant. But along with the elegant look, it leads to possibly the biggest negative I have with this phone. I’m going to let this out early and not wait until the end of the review, as there are so many positive features about this phone, I’ll just share the one primary negative that I have with this phone right away. If there was one thing that I was somewhat put off, it was the curved back design of the XPERIA XZ2. Already, I have seen the phone drop as its sleek background and curved back covering, made the phone vibrate and fall. Even when putting on top of a few things, it would fall. You will definitely need to lie it perfectly flat or get a protective case. In fact, if there was anything negative about the phone, it’s that sleek curvature. While it looks nice, last thing you want is to put your phone on top of your office desk, set it to vibrate and watch it move on its own until it falls off the desk, table, sofa, etc. So, look into getting a protective case that is somewhat rugged. Word of caution, just be careful that the case you are getting is for the premium and not the regular XPERIA XZ2. In addition, I was often scared to hold this phone when shooting photos or video. It was quite slippery. If you are a phone dropper, once again, I highly recommend getting a protective case that is somewhat rugged. Upon getting the phone all setup and ready, you go through establishing your security and also fingerprint (done on the rear of the phone), which works perfectly. I setup the wi-fi and then it was time to go and test the device! So, I took a little Gundam Gunpla model to do my tests and first, a regular shot using the camera. One button press of filters made it easy to customize the photo fairly quickly… I tested the camera and I like the bokeh that was produced. But once I put it through the photo editor to do some post-production, I was able to bring out the colors and experiment with the different filters the software offers. I also liked how well the camera was able to shoot in low-light conditions using the manual or superior auto settings. But I was quite pleased with the detail that the camera had when focusing on the olives on the olive tree and close up of the olive tree branch. As for video, I’ll need to do more tests, because while I did do a 4K HDR video, it looks soft. It could be the sun, perhaps I hit another button as you can adjust filters to the video but I plan to do more video tests soon. Also, to see how well the camera holds up in shooting in long durations. I tested the slow-motion, but it came out as 480p, I tried it again a second time and saw the screen info. that you can go 960p. I did have one major concern, it’s hot right now in California. Super hot! And while shooting in 4K, the phone started to overheat, I could feel the heat projecting behind the unit and I got a warning that the phone’s temperature was getting hot, so I stopped using it for a little while. Sure, I have’t had this before, but I wasn’t shooting 4K for that long, nor was I outside in the heat that long either. When it came to gaming, I tested the phone and this is where it really did well. May it be “Asphalt 9” or “PUBG for Mobile”, the games, no matter how intense the graphics were, the phone was able to play these games flawlessly with no glitching. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 mobile platform did very well. And as for music, the phone worked wonderfully in playing back music on Google’s Play Music and currently, Paul Abdul’s best album is available for free and the phone produced great sound via the included earbuds, but I prefer my B&O headphones for better clarity. But what I didn’t like all that much is the vibration during Paula Abdul’s “Straight Up”. Which leads me to the DVS. Now what about the all-new Dynamic Vibration System? For those who have had a PS3 or PS4 know how it is to play a game with the control vibrating. There is a slider (when accessing the volume) which you can adjust the vibration system, but do you want vibration for music? Video? or Gaming? If so, now you can have that vibration to go along and enhance your experience. I particularly don’t, so I have it turned off. As for charging, the phone, each time I let it get near dying and after an hour plugging it in, I was able to get back nearly 80% back, so I say around 80 or so minutes of charging and your back to 100%. But for those who want wireless charging, will want to check out Sony’s wireless charging dock WCH20. I tested my IC card from Japan to make sure the phone can read it perfectly (ala Suica Reader) and it worked perfectly. And I can say that the apps opened up fairly quick on the SONY XPERIA XZ2. I had no problems with any apps that I have downloaded or anything crashing. JUDGMENT CALL: So far, I really like the SONY XPERIA XZ2 Premium. In terms of power and features, you get a lot. But it all comes down to the 4K features and whether or not you are willing to spend the extra $$$ to get the capability. For me, I need the capability to shoot 4K video, I also want the ability to edit on the fly and while it has 64GB of space, I want the ability to expand to larger Micro SDXC if possible. Also, for where I shoot, locations in Tokyo are becoming strict where they give me permissions to shoot, but when they see the camera, even a small point and shoot, they say “No. Only smartphone only”. So, I needed a phone that did 4K and I can quickly view at 4K. The only caveat is the curvature of the back, how slippery it is and chances of your phone falling/dropping is heightened. But aside from that and the overheating warning I got, which I’ll let it sly since I have seen that happen before (as we get temperatures over 105 F frequently). Bare in mine, the SONY XPERIA XZ2 Premium just came out, so I’m sure there will be some sort of major update coming out. There are also numerous themes you can download from the Google Play Store as well. Overall, I absolutely like the SONY XPERIA XZ2 Premium. I do think the price is slightly high for the most part, for the features that you are getting and the amount of power and convenience, I’m actually enjoying it more now over the Samsung Galaxy and Apple iPhone which I use. I definitely recommend the SONY XPERIA XZ2 Premium!",23,"Sony"

"2673","B07DF9R73K",5,"false","So I have had the Pixel 2 and the iPhone X so I have a good basis for comparison. The new Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium is amazing and just as good as the Pixel 2 and iPhone X. Actually better in some ways. First of all the construction. Definitely better than the Pixel 2 and just as good as the iPhone X if not a little better. I mean this is an amazingly constructed phone. Solid and smooth with no gaps. Screen. I one word amazing! If you watch a lot of videos this screen will amaze you! Much better than the Pixel 2 and, in my opinion, slightly better than the iPhone X. The colors look very natural without being over saturated. The resolution is crystal clear and sharp as a tack. Definitely the best smartphone screen I have ever seen. Speed: Blazing fast. It's really a tossup between the Pixel 2, iPhone X and the XZ2 Premium. They all fly without a hiccup. So this one is a draw. All great. OS: This really comes down to personal preference. If you are heavily invested in iOS then you will probably prefer the iPhone. From an android perspective I absolutely love the touches Sony has put on their cut of Android. Not heavy handed at all but just the right amount of Sony personalization. Really top notch. Definitely the best implementation of Android I have seen outside of the Pixel 2. Battery: The XZ2 Premium, for my use, has a better battery than the Pixel 2 and the iPhone X. It lasts me all day of heavy use. Pixel 2 battery the worst, then iPhone X and then the top of the heap is the XZ2. To top it off the XZ2 charges really fast. Camera: Amazing! It matches the Pixel 2 and iPhone X toe to toe. Great in low light and amazing in bright daylight pics as well. People talk about the iPhone X and Pixel 2 having amazing phones but the XZ2 Premium is right up there. I highly doubt you could tell a difference between the three. They are all great. Sony makes quality electronics and this phone is definitely a quality piece of tech. I have had a ton of people ask me about this phone as it looks so nice. Overall a great phone that I heartily recommend!",8,"Sony"
"2674","B07DF9R73K",4,"false","I bought the ZX2 Premium in Chrome Black used for $700 because the original asking price is plain and simple ridiculous. As an owner of Samsung and LG flagship devices the ZX2 Premium does not warrant the high premium price that its name suggests. To date the device that has outperformed all others was the Z Ultra which was years ahead of its time and to date no other Sony device or Samsung or LG has come close. Unfortunately, for some reason the Sony brand in the US has gone downhill and makes me sad that the smartphone ""bang for the buck"" is not as it was- say -about 4 years ago. Regardless this ZX2 Premium that I bought for substantially less than $999 does surprise in performance, speed, multitasking, and overall look of the phone. The screen is ok but not close to what they advertise. They know how to make great screens..Just look at their TVs and like I said their past monster smartphone- the Z Ultra. The XZ2 Premium is heavy...Again, heavy and just like the asking price of $999 it makes no sense for the phone to be so heavy. I get it they have premium materials but this thing is a brink in the pocket. I would recommend it if you like near stock Android or the Sony user interface of past phones and super fast performance. Pros: Speed, multitasking, Performance, Near stock Android experience Cons: Heavy, Price, Screen colors I know for a fact could be better, Overall physical footprint is too big for screen size.",1,"Sony"

It is quite heavy and pretty huge, so definitely keep that in mind as you're thinking about buying it - it's significantly heavier than my 3previous phones and it's hard to use it in the car so I'll need to buy a new mount to support its weight. Camera is good, but from all the reviews and specs I was expecting to be blown away which I was not. It's a good camera but I expected something even better from Sony especially with the flagship price and focus on the camera as the main selling point for this phone. Overall, it's a keeper and I'm loving my new phone. I bought it from Amazon at a much lower price than the $875-$1000 range its going for..

"2696","B07DF9R73K",4,"false","XZ2 PREMIUM VS REGULAR XZ2 Sony’s release strategy is mystifying. Mere months after debuting their $800 Xperia XZ2, here comes the $1000 Xperia XZ2 Premium. Why release them so close together? Why cannibalize Sony’s already meager sales? Why have two models at all? Who can say. I’d like to be a fly on the walls of the meetings in which they decide these things, but overall it seems to be a strategy designed to confuse average consumers and irritate Sony fans. In comparison to the XZ2 stablemate, which is a very able flagship phone in its own right, the XZ2 Premium maintains the Snapdragon 845 chipset, bumps the RAM up to 6gb, adds a second rear camera for improved low-light performance, and boasts a 16:9 4K HDR screen, as opposed to the XZ2’s 18:9 full HD+ screen (also HDR capable). Otherwise, the phones are very similar, running Sony’s light Android 8.0 skin, sharing most of the same camera features (960fps slow-mo at 1080p, burst mode with motion tracking, predictive capture, 3D object scanning), and accepting micro-SD cards while ditching the headphone jack. And of course, a major difference is size. SIZE, WEIGHT, BUILD QUALITY Normally, I don’t dedicate a whole section of a review to how large or heavy a phone is. But it really is warranted here. There cannot be a serious discussion of the XZ2 Premium without it. Although this phone is very comparable in height and width to an iPhone 8 Plus, The XZ2 Premium weighs 236g (8.32 oz) to the iPhone 8 Plus’ 202g (7.13 oz). I made a phone call yesterday in which I was on hold for a few minutes – I really started to feel it after the first few minutes of holding the phone up to my ear! In an attached picture, I demonstrate how far I can reach with my thumb while holding the phone in what I consider to be the most reasonable way (with pinky under the bottom). I have slightly larger than average sized hands, and this is definitely a two-handed device for the most part. Now, personally I’m mostly OK with this. Except for toilet gaming (you know you do it), I prefer doing most phone functions with two hands, whether typing on Facebook or taking pictures. But given the combination of size and weight, I think a case is an absolute must, and if possible a case with a wrist strap. I absolutely love wrist straps on my phones, having had them on my Nokia Lumia 1020, Sony XZ Premium, and Sony XZ2. But given Sony’s niche status in the US marketplace, it can be a real chore to find one. The best by far is this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GJGWXHM/ Despite the hulking dimensions, I can still can fit the phone easily into my front jeans pockets (where I normally stow a phone). All of this grousing about the size is not to say that it isn’t excellently built. The phone feels very sturdy, and I have no worries about bending or mangling it. I have not scratched either surface in two weeks of solid use and pocket storage. The buttons are excellent and the two-stage camera shutter is great to have. The Sim/Micro-SD card tray does not require any additional tools to remove. And the whole thing is IP68/65 dust and water resistant, so no worries on rainy days. PERFORMANCE AND BATTERY LIFE There is a Snapdragon 845 chipset and 6gb of RAM under the hood here, so performance at regular Android tasks is buttery smooth. I will say that when viewing pictures in Sony’s “Album” app (which I like quite a bit, there is a bit of stutter swiping from one to the next – presumably owing to the 4k screen and the task of rendering each new image at that resolution. But that’s the only slowdown I’ve noticed. The phone switches between apps with aplomb, and only very rarely gets warm. On the negative side, the auto-brightness is wacky, frequently settling on too dim, and then not pumping up fast enough when exposed to brighter surrounding conditions. This was fixed via update in all the previous Sony phones I’ve used, so I expect the same here. Battery life is OK. It is easy to reach the end of a day with more than 50% battery. I would say that in a 16-hour day, from 100% charge to 0%, you can expect about 5 hours of screen-on time, including heavy camera use, Facebook, messaging, email, and a phone call or two. Battery drain during standby is also admirably light, perhaps 2% per hour. This isn’t a 2-day workhorse, though. Still present are Sony’s excellent Battery Care and Stamina modes. Battery Care learns your charging schedule and keeps your battery below 90% for as long as it can (which produces less wear and tear on the Li-ion cells) and only tops off in the last hour before you wake up. Stamina does a great job of locking down background functions if you need to make it through one more hour. CAMERA This is Sony’s most hyped feature on this model, and what they seem to hope will justify the astronomical asking price. This is their first dual-camera module on a phone. Instead of using the second lens for zoom, they are using it for monochrome light information, in order to boost the low-light performance of the camera. The camera also shoots 4K HDR video, and does 960fps slow motion at 1080p. I do think this is the best camera Sony has produced. Its low light performance is excellent and the electronic image stabilization is quite good in both stills and videos. The burst features I so enjoyed on the XZ Premium and the XZ2 are also still present – basically, you can take a burst of dozens of shots while the camera keeps the subject in focus. It really does work, and it’s a boon for pictures of children or pets. A recent update has added quite nice Bokeh and Monochrome modes. If camera is a priority in a phone for you, as it is for me, the XZ2 Premium is a good buy. I have attached some samples, with an emphasis on challenging low light shots, to give you an idea. CONCLUSION What are its key selling points, and do they live up to the billing? 1. A 4K HDR screen. It’s a very nice screen, but I can’t say that it really beats the 18:9 screens on most flagships today. It bests them in rarefied situations like 4k video on YouTube or looking closely at photos. Mostly it looks just as nice as the best flagship out there – but the 16:9 aspect ratio also makes it feel comparatively huge in the hand. 2. A dual-lens camera that shoots 4k HDR video and excels in low-light photography. These are definitely real selling points. The camera is on par with other flagships in daylight shots, but definitely pulls ahead in low-light video and is probably tied with the very best in low-light stills (currently the Huawei P20 Pro and the Google Pixel 2). All of the other features are on par with the best flagships – chipset, RAM, storage options, and the like. Look, here’s the dirty little secret – for the past several years, every single Sony phone has dropped in price by a good 25% within three months. Despite their high quality and performance, they are not selling like hotcakes. So I will not recommend that you purchase the XZ2 Premium at its MSRP. If you are considering this against its stablemate, the regular Xperia XZ2, at the end of the day they are extremely similar, and unless 4K HDR filming is important to you, you should very strongly consider it, as it is significantly less expensive. I will however recommend that you give the XZ2 Premium a hard look when it is 25% cheaper. It’s a beautiful, albeit monstrously heavy, piece of hardware that performs as well as the best phones on the market.",11,"Sony"

The screen is bright and beautiful, honestly I can't tell that it's 4k, it looks like and 1440p display but it's visible in the sun with nice colors and contrast, I feel like we've reached a sort of peak awith screens because too bright is uncomfortable and we definitely don't need more pixels per inch. Unless you put it directly next to something like an s9 you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference. The Sony UI is ok. A little dull, close to stock which is good. I just wish they'd give up and actually use stock so updates could be faster. That being said it is the latest version and from what I've heard Sony is good with updates so here's hoping this is one of the earliest on Android Q. One thing that drives me absolutely crazy is the buttons. There's no option to always hide them in every app so in non native apps like CHROME or Amazon or reddit they just... Hover there like I'm in 2014.. this is Android pie, what the heck? I emailed don't about this and they said there are apps on the playstore which is true but they require you to root the phone which I don't want to do with a brand new phone.. The camera is amazing. Best low light photos and videos I've ever seen. I haven't used the pixel so I can't compare to that and I'm not much of a photographer so take what I say with a grain of salt, but it's amazing. The daylight photos turn out good too, just like everyone else. But I can take this out in the middle of the night and if the moon is out or there's a single street light or some source of light it can take very useable photos, clearer than my eye can see. Like seriously amazing, captures stars and everything. I bet if someone got a tripod and put the shudder speed down to a few minutes it would take some really breathtaking photos. Videos are good too, but I don't care too much for Cameras.. Preformace is snappy and quick, never run into any lag or dropped any calls and I'm huge on multitasking. Design is.. ok. I'm so sick of these glass backed phones. I know it's the norm but they are awful. Miserable. I put a case on it day one and every few days I take it off to clean it with a microfiber cloth and I see all the new magical freaking scratches that came from who knows where. I hate glass, if you're actually using the phone it will get scratches no matter what. Maybe skins? I don't know I'll have to try. Outside of that it is a very beautiful device, I've heard a lot of complaints about finger print scanner placement but after a few weeks it's normal and natural and I don't have any fingers in the corners of my pictures which is nice. One thing I will mention is the earpiece is super depressed in the screen and it's very hard to clean. That's annoying. I like the weight though, it's very comfortable to hold. Battery is.. just bad. It's not good at all. Days where I'm really busy and don't do anything but listen to music and check email and make a few calls I'll end the day with 65 to 80% but most days where I watch some YouTube videos on lte I'm at 20-25% by 5 or 6pm. The last time I had a phone with this poor of a battery was the LG g3 I think. That being said it does usually make it through the day and if not it charges up pretty quickly, worst case I plug it in for 20-30 minutes and I get 40% of my battery back AND the smart charging thing is pretty awesome, I don't know much about batteries but I've always wondered if it was bad to leave it plugged in all night, this gives me some peace of mind and I love that. The speakers were also a bit of a disappointment. The last phone I used was the Razer phone 2 (had a dead pixel on arrival so I returned) and I only used that for a day but those speakers were amazing, then I got this I was hyped because I love f on facing dual speakers but these are just sufficient. The sound quality is great but it does not get very loud. Loud enough for most situations but if youre in a very noisy environment trying to show a friend a video they probably won't cut it. They are good though, definitely better than the s9+ or iPhone or any LG phone I've used recently, just a bit disappointing for front facing. And the headphone jack? Why no headphone jack? I hate this trend. All in all though it's a pretty good phone, I've never had a stutter and there are some things I hate but it's one of the best options at the time. Mind you I payed $650 a month ago and now sony has released their latest and greatest so I'd recommend not purchasing this for a penny more than $600",7,"Sony"

"2702","B07H6V8TB9",5,"true","The Sony Xperia XZ3 is really an amazing Cell Phone. My only complaint is with Sony, why, because the Xperia XZ3 Lens is constructed using Gorilla Temper Glass 5. Well, my phone had fallen out of my shirt pocket when bent over which was about waist high, needless to say, the lens cracked. I called Sony told them of the situation and their response was, they would repair the lens for $250.00 plus shipping. Now, to my understanding Gorilla Temper Glass 5 has a drop ratio from shoulder high. My phone was and still in a case designed specifically for the Xperia XZ3 and the glass still cracked. So, if you carry your phone in your top pocket, beware - because if it does fall and the lens crack Sony is the only one in the position to change the lens out.

"2711","B07H6V8TB9",5,"true","Summary: This is a prestige style option that feels unparalleled in the hand and sports an industry-leading screen - if that is what is important to you, this is the phone of your dreams, and the few minor complaints will be entirely acceptable. Pros: * Gorgeous design. The Forest Green color is incredibly attractive and gives handsome variation in tone in different lighting. While Sony has moved into a curved world, the monolithic lines of the profile (including the very narrow corners) remain and remind me of what I loved about the Z1 Compact. The 2:1 aspect ratio makes this phone more slender than most. The glossy black finish of the front with the curved edges is really something else. This is what sold me and I have not been disappointed. * Excellent materials. The contour of the glass is incredibly pleasing in the hand, as is the thin aluminum frame. While some have different opinions on glass backs, the full glass coverage mitigates some of the slipperiness of the phone's curved edges by providing grip - something I missed with the magnesium back of the Pixel. The design may have sold me, but the feel of the phone in the hand is what's confirming the decision. * OLED screen. Fantastic quality, insane DPI, it's very clear this is the same tech Sony uses in its Bravia screens. I wouldn't have come back to Sony without this. * Great camera. Works well in many different lighting scenarios. * Snappy processor. I haven't noticed any slowdown and new games/apps work perfectly well. I'm not a huge gamer though so other reviews might cover this better than I will. * Fingerprint scanner. For many, the low rear placement has been a con. For those of us with smaller hands, it's a godsend, plain and simple. * Dedicated camera button. I missed you! * No notch. If you like notches, flip this to the con category! Neutral * Picks up fingerprints easily. On the other hand, they wipe off easily. Since it's so gorgeous when wiped clean, hard to call this a big winner or loser. Cons * Slippery. Will slide off of angled surfaces. This is mitigated in the hand by the glass. So while I feel secure not putting this phone in a case, I need to be cognizant of where I put it down. * No headphone jack. This was a hard reality for me to come to, but when I'm out and about I'm using bluetooth and when I'm home I can plug in the USB-C to use my fancy headphones. * Weak battery - I make it through the day with email, news, a few minutes of fire emblem/youtube, but not by much. * Expensive. Sony seems to be pricing to make up for weak sales in the US. Maybe they got a few more bucks from me, but I'm not convinced it's a winning strategy.",2,"Sony"
"2712","B07H6V8TB9",5,"true","I enjoy the OLED screen. Edge sense is an interesting function I am playing with where app icons pop up when you touch the edge of the screen. This supports band 12 and VoLTE on T-Mobile which is not common on Xperia. I preferred the fingerprint scanner on the side, on the back is a little awkward. Qi charging is nice, make sure to get a case that will not interfere. I chose this over the XZ2 premium mainly due to the band 12 with VoLTE on Tmobile and the OLED which the XZ2 Premium does not have but I was tempted by the XZ2 Premium dual camera. As is typical of glass body the phone is a little slippery so a case would be a good idea. I got it with the Xperia Ear Duo which I enjoy but it is not for everyone. The duo on purpose lets one hear sound around you which is great for biking or walking etc. but would not block out any noise on a train, a plane or any other environment with a lot of noise. I found the sound a little bit low in some cases. The assistant is interesting, I enjoy it but it is not for everyone.

The location of the finger print sensor isn't an issue at all for me. I just hold the phone from the bottom and the sensor is right where my finger lands. The image quality of the camera to me is just average. I know there are many adjustments and I'm sure I could tweak it to be great. Just that comparing it to my S8 right out of the box isn't too impressive. I also miss the time lapse option. Great phone altogether though, premium materials and build quality, the green and red versions are STUNNING! Absolutely a contender.",3,"Sony"

I would say it is a nicer piece of hardware than my son's iPhone X. Some of the things I liked: 1. Very nicely finished. The craftsmanship is on par with anything out there. 2. Wrap around screen with edge sense short cuts - much like Samsung high end phones. 3. Really fast processor. I still like my iPhones, but this thing feels twice as zippy. 4. Fingerprint sensor on the back side. Good idea. 5. No crashes, no hassles getting it going. 6. Fast boot from cold start. 7. Multi day battery life - about 2x the life of my iPhone. 8. USB C connector - enter the modern age. 9. Sharp camera, but needs some post production color correction, IMO. 10. Awesomely good looking screen. I shot a photo of the screen and posted it to show how the screen is a ""retina-like"" imaging device. Maybe better. Middling issues. 1. The camera is nice, but I don't think the color balance is as good as on my iPhone. The Xperia colors are too vivid and the iPhone is more natural to my eyes. 2. Uh, it's Android and that means you have a certain amount of arranging to do before it becomes super useful. I've never liked Android as much as iOS. I can use it, but then again I've used RT-11, VMS, DOS and Unix 4.x BSD ... I don't value the total control aspect as much as others do.

"2739","B07H6V8TB9",4,"false","Let me say up front that we're an Xperia family - I just moved from the XZ1 to the XZ3, and my daughter just went from the XZ Compact to the XZ Compact 2. So it hurts me a little to say it, but I don't like the XZ3 nearly as much as the XZ1. What's good: - The quality is flagship worthy. The screen is beautiful, the cameras are great, and I assume it's at least as waterproof as my XZ1 was. (And my XZ1 spent 4 hours 15 feet down in the ocean and started working as soon as we found it and brought it back up!) - The battery is pretty good, and even for a heavy user like me, lasts a full day as long as I'm not running Waze. What could be better - As beautiful as the phone is, there is no way to use it without a case. It has curved sides and a glass back, and I just guarantee it will slip sooner or later. - Instead of the nice wide buttons of the XZ1, the XZ3 has super skinny buttons (apparently made to fit the curved sides) that are much harder to press, especially if the phone is in a case, which, as stated, its design basically requires. As much as I love having a dedicated camera button, I feel like I need to press it with my fingernail to reliably hit it, which removes a lot of the convenience. (It can also be hard to hit the volume button correctly, and I've already accidentally turned on assisted mode twice!) - I really liked having a fingerprint scanner in the power button. I'm learning to use the one on the back, but it's sort of begging for me to miss and get my greasy fingers all over the nearby camera lens.

"2741","B07H6V8TB9",5,"true","Pros: 1. The screen is ABSOLUTE GORGEOUS, I own Samsung Note 9 and Xs Max, the screen on this Sony is unbeatable. Sony used a newer technology to produce their screen and it is looking fantastic. 2. Doesn't wobble that much on the desk comparing to XZ2. 3. VoLTE is working for T-Mobile (I wan't able to test on other carriers). 4. Comes with Android 9 out of the box. 5. Front facing camera is amazing with much clearer pictures comparing to XZ2, even better than Xs Max. 6. Very sleek design and it has NO NOTCH!! 7. Front facing speakers sounds really good comparing to Note 9. 8. Dedicated camera button instead of a Bixby button. Cons: 1. Fingerprint scanner is still a bit awkwardly placed. 2. Even though it comes with Android 9, the gesture control like on the new Pixel 3 phones is removed. (I personally don't care since the gesture control is really awkward anyway) 3. Even though it packs a 3300mAh battery, I have less battery percentage after a day of use comparing to Xs Max, but it does hold me through a day. (I have 6 hours of screen on time; I watch YouTube videos, play games, and scroll through social media apps like Facebook and Instagram.) 4. Headphone jack is gone forever for flagship phones from Sony (I use their bluetooth headphones and LDAC is great on playing my FLAC files through bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me.) Conclusion: This is really a great phone from Sony. They improved this phone from XZ2 in all of the aspects. Awesome display, great front facing speakers, and great cameras. The battery life is average to good comparing to other flagships in 2018, but it still is able to hold me through a day, so I have so complaints here. Sony is the only company out there still adding a dedicated camera button, and I have to say, I love it. If you are looking out there for a great phone from Sony, this is a really nice option even if it costs $900 (I pre-ordered it with the Ear Duo bundle, but I would still buy it for $900 for phone only).",90,"Sony"
"2742","B07H6V8TB9",4,"false","Being a Vine reviewer puts me in a strange position relative to most phone users. I keep getting offered Sony phones, because I've reviewed them in the past. I have now reviewed the XA1, XZ1, XZ2, and XZ2 Premium. So I have a very fine grained perspective when it comes to the XZ3, and will approach this from the aspect of ""which Sony phone should you choose?"" *Why Sony?* First, I suppose, is the question of ""Why a Sony Phone?"" Well, the answer to my mind is an emphasis on entertainment, with excellent screens and front-facing stereo speakers. Second is camera, with an emphasis on high detail, high-megapixel photos. Third is general build quality - Sony makes beautiful hardware. Now, of course, Apple and Samsung also do these three things pretty well, too. They take differing approaches to camera and A/V quality, but I do think these three companies are within spitting distance of each other. *Sony’s 2018 Lineup* OK, Now, I'm going to compare the three most recent Sony models - the XZ2, XZ2 Premium, and XZ3. I don't know what Sony execs are smoking over there in Tokyo, but they have decided to release these models within 6 months of each other - from April through October 2018, respectively. So new stock is still available for all three. Why they chose to cannibalize themselves this way is beyond me. I can't imagine an XZ2 buyer being very happy with Sony releasing the XZ3 a bit less than 6 months after they plunked down for their current phone. All three phones share Sony's new ""Ambient Flow"" design language. This means they are round, slippery, shiny glass sandwich phones that have reduced bezels compared to their predecessors and a fingerprint sensor in the center of the rear of the phone body. All three share the ""Motion Eye"" camera sensor that excels at 960fps slow motion filming, 4K HDR video, and capturing bursts of moving still shots while staying in focus. All three utilize the Snapdragon 845 system-on-a-chip with Adreno 630 graphics. So they are all very capable 2018 Android flagships. The differences: The XZ2 has 4gb of RAM on board. It has an 18:9 IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1080x2160. The XZ2 Premium has 6gb of RAM, a 16:9 4K IPS LCD screen at 3840x2160, and a second monochrome camera module for improved low light performance. The XZ3 kind of splits the difference between the two. It has 4gb of RAM, the same camera module as the XZ2, but upgrades the 18:9 screen to a 6 inch HDR OLED display with a resolution of 1440x1880. Price wise, these models are going for 700, 1000, and 900 respectively at present. So the $200 difference between the XZ2 and XZ3 all comes down to the screen. And I will say, it is an absolutely beautiful screen. The blacks are as close to zero as they eye can see, and the brightness for HDR video is spectacular. It also has the trendy curved side edges that you might like on the Samsung Galaxy line. But otherwise, the XZ3 is functionally identical to the XZ2. It performs the same, gets basically the same 1-day battery life (5-6 hours of screen on time), and takes identical pictures. I would say the price premium is only justified if you really prize the display and watch a lot of high quality video. The XZ2 Premium is a bit of a different beast. It does perform basically identically on Android tasks, given the same internals. The 6gb of RAM seem to be dedicated to the camera, which is the big differentiator. Adding the second low-light module to the camera does improve low light performance over the XZ2 and XZ3. It’s not night and day (so to speak) but the differences are clearly there upon close inspection. There is more detail and less noise on the XZ2 Premium’s low light photos. Its screen is the highest resolution of the bunch, and it performs well with HDR video – though the XZ3 probably beats it with its deeper native contrast ratio. Now, is this worth a $300 price premium over the XZ2? Personally, I don’t think so. Given the choice of which one to use for free, I’ll take the XZ2 Premium. But if I were doing the math on my own budget, the XZ2 would be extremely tempting. *XZ3 Specific notes* The XZ3 does also add a few new features, almost all of which are superfluous. “Side Sense” brings up a shortcut menu when you double tap the curved edges of the screen. It is prone to misfires, though, so is more of an annoyance than anything. The phone also recognizes when you pull it out of your pocket and orient it in landscape, and pulls up the camera. But since you still have to tap the screen to initiate the camera, it really offers no benefit over the (wonderful) dedicated shutter button. The XZ3 is probably the prettiest of the three phones, and is also the lightest. If you’re into comparing phones with your friends, it is likely the one which will get the most “oohs and aahs” next to a Galaxy S9 or iPhone Xs. A case is an absolute necessity, since the phone is so thin, svelte, and slippery. I almost dropped it several times before nestling it into its excellent Ringke Fusion X case. *Conclusion* People who want to buy a Sony phone have been put in a hard spot by… Sony. It has released three similar flagship phones within 6 months. All three of the phones perform basically identically when it comes to speed. The XZ3 has the best screen. The XZ2 Premium has the best camera. Which of these three areas of performance you value most is how you should make your decision if a Sony phone is in your future. I frankly think the XZ2 will offer the best bang-for-buck for most users. It is also the model that is now best situated to compete with phones like the OnePlus 6T on price. Only those who seriously prioritize display or camera should consider the “step-up” models, which come at a significant price premium. Photos: 1. XZ2 Premium cat in very low light 2.

"2743","B07H6V8TB9",4,"true","Pros: The screen is stunning. I'll be watching a lot more videos on this phone than usual. The design is really well thought out and feels very premium and sturdy. It feels like top notch materials were used. A lot of little things have been refined coming from other Xperia devices, such as double tap to wake being added, stamina mode performance is increased so typing isn't an issue, reworked camera app. Cons: The phone is lacking WiFi calling and VoLTE support on the T-mobile network (I'm assuming this is the same for all US carriers). This is a huge let down and really impacts the effectiveness of this device as a cell phone. The screen is so great that I'm going to be wasting a lot of battery watching videos. Oh well. Some of my initial camera shots with medium light came out a little grainy. I'm not sure if this is an isolated issue but it's still less than ideal in a $900 phone. Lack of support in the U. S. in some ways, such as lack of accessories or carrier support. Full review: Starting out with the design, the phone definitely feels great. It's a big phone, yet it still manages to feel elegant in the hand. It's a bit heavy but the weight is distributed evenly so it isn't very apparent. The build quality appears to be very premium and I imagine it will hold up well to time, as most Sony phones I have had tend to last. Almost every review I've heard on this phone has made some mention of the finger print sensor location being too low. I have average sized hands and make contact with the sensor every time. I think I prefer this location over one that is higher up only because I'd rather bend my finger to make contact with the sensor instead of stretching it. This is one of those things that is purely a personal preference and I think reviewers are complaining to complain, what's new. The software is very familiar if you've ever used a Sony/Android phone before, and is easy to learn if you haven't. If you're thinking about switching from an iPhone, Android is quite a liberating experience, and Sony makes it easy to transfer over with the Xperia Companion App. A couple new software features have been added, such as the side sense feature which is similar to the HTC and Pixel phone squeezes, although it may not be entirely as reliable, but I still find it quite useful. I have heard of some users complaining about accidently activating side sense, but I haven't had that issue (either due to how I hold the phone or possibly an update, I'm not sure which)(actually just kidding I see what they're talking about now, if your palms or fingers overlap onto the screen, it picks it up as a tap occasionally). Everything feels very fluid and I doubt it would be any different if Sony did include 6GB of RAM, but hey six is bigger than four and I'm sure it wouldn't hurt the user that much to have more RAM, even with a slightly higher drain on battery. A boost mode would be cool to have if you wanted to utilize all 6 gigs at once, and then have it be off during typical use. The new android 9 pie operating system doesn't seem all that different from 8, but I believe that is a good thing because most software related features seem good how they are right now. Various little tweaks have been made here and there by Sony, and most that I can see are either optional or beneficial to the user. The ability to disable and customize things like side sense and the dynamic vibration are awesome and I'm so glad Sony gives the option for this rather than forcing it upon users. I would appreciate seeing this in a few other places however such as with adaptive charging, like manually setting a wake up time instead of my phone trying (and failing) to automatically predict when I will wake up. Finally night mode was added! My poor crippled eyes can finally experience that comforting warm hue when I'm staying up past my bed time. The battery is as good or better than most other offerings out there today. I am almost always able to squeeze out two days of usage from my Sony phones without recharging, and I'd consider myself a medium to heavy user but I do actively try to save battery by reducing brightness, closing apps and turning on stamina mode when needed. Stamina mode is great and ultra stamina mode is great for Bear Grylls. Unfortunately there isn't a fast charger included in the box, just a regular charger. I usually recharge overnight anyway but it is kind of a bummer that I don't feel like a super elite first class dude with the best stuff after spending near a grand on a phone. Battery Care is a nice feature from Sony in a world where most other phone companies are treating their lithium ion filled phablets like a disposable Kodak camera. Next up is the screen. My previous phone was the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, which I thought had an amazing display, and it did, but this phone kicked that up a couple notches. When I started watching videos on this phone with maxed out resolution it felt like the first time I saw a 4K TV on display at Best Buy. I feel really lame admitting this but I got goosebumps. Whatever it could have been cold in my house I'm not sure. It is great to look at though, seeing the screen in person is the only way that you will experience the perfection of this screen. Colors look excellent to me, everything just pops in a realistic way. Nothing really seems washed out or overexposed. Sony did a fantastic job calibrating this. I haven't used a Note 9 or iPhone XS yet so I can't comment on which one is better but I'd feel confident in saying Samsung and Apple have some very tough competition. One thing I will say about the screen is that it looks slightly blue on the curved sections, but this doesn't necessarily apply when watching videos, only when viewing a white screen, so it's not a huge complaint from me as it isn't intrusive or distracting. Sound. Wow this phone kicks! After unboxing the phone I turned up the volume all the way and started watching a video and it was actually loud! Surprisingly, I turned it down. I was surprised again later in the day when I was using the phone for GPS and the speakers were able to surpass the road noise from driving on the highway which I don't think I've ever experienced in a phone before. The Dynamic Vibration System is an interesting experience, and I think with a little bit of tweaking and reduction of latency, Sony might have something cool on their hands. I'd find myself sort of missing it when I turned it off, because in the lowest setting it feels like it adds bass to the phone, even if it doesn't in reality. The subtle sound based vibration isn't going to radically alter your media consumption but hey at least Sony is trying new stuff! Obviously this phone is missing the auxiliary port which to some aux snobs is probably a turn off. The only time I use my aux is when I'm in the car and feeling auxy but even then that isn't very often so this just comes down to personal preference. I think dongles are lame but hey whatever it doesn't really apply to me so I can't tell you how it should apply to yourself. The camera is kind of the typical bag of Sony goodies. You have the super slowmo 960 FPS at 1080p I believe and the 4k HDR video recording. What they offer is on par with most other high end phones. I haven't extensively tested the camera so I don't want to jump to any conclusions. What I do know is that Sony hasnt reinvented the smartphone camera here yet. You still get very good shots that are quite situational. In good light with a steady hand your shots will look good. With hands as shaky as the Dynamic Vibration system on this phone and a night darker than the perfect blacks on this phone's OLED screen, your picture is going to look like some soup. I'll probably come back and update this part of the review once I go outside and experience nature in more than one light setting. Some of my other thoughts on this phone include other bits about the Sony ecosystem and the actual experience of living with the phone. Sony phones have always held up well to time in my experience, more so than any other phone brands I've tried, including Apple, Samsung, HTC, LG and even Pixel phones. I have the same high expectations for this phone. I enjoy the apps Sony has preloaded, such as the album app and music app. It actually gives you an option upon the very first startup on whether you want to install certain other apps (or bloatware depending on who you are) which is pretty cool! I installed most of them because it was stuff like the Playstation app and Amazon that I'm going to use anyway. I really wish Sony would do more with this phone in terms of Playstation compatability. You do have the option of PS4 remote play, which works good with a great internet connection, but I believe there is so much more innovation and opportunity waiting to happen between the Playstation and Sony Mobile teams! Okay now to the part of living with this phone and probably the biggest criticism from me. I have a sneaking suspicion that the whole country known as the United States of America is like a red-headed step child to Sony Mobile. In this metaphor they provide us with a roof over our heads and some food, but not much else. In the US it is highly unlikely that you will find XZ3 cases or screen protectors in your local electronic store, and your cell phone provider will most likely look at you like a fool when you let them know that Sony does indeed make phones. Have fun importing the official Sony style cases to the US if you want them, or maybe even the cool wireless charging stand that is sold in currencies that don't have a $ before them. I really really want this phone to be my perfect phone but it doesn't support Wi-Fi calling. This is a huge miscalculation by whoever made the decision, be it T-mobile or Sony or some higher diety. If you have set foot inside the US then you most likely know it's the land of the free and home of the sprawling empty area outside of cities that has little to no cell reception. I have literally had better reception in rural Thailand than in the middle of the second biggest city in my state, so WiFi calling should be as necessary to phones in 2018 as a fingerprint sensor (I would gladly give up the sensor for Wi-Fi calling BTW). This being said, if you need a phone that can be a means of communication above all else, I do not believe the XZ3 is for you. It really pains me to say that because this phone does so many things right, but the one area it lacks in is the main thing phones are used for, communication. That being said, cell reception is good and I haven't noticed anything wonky in the areas I normally get reception. To summarize my points, this is an excellent phone, but there are quite a few other excellent phones out there. This is one of the few phones that is hard to complain about if you're an average (or anything other than average) phone user. If you like Sony phones, or well designed tech, you're going to love this phone. If you have an issue with losing out on Wi-Fi calling or VoLTE, you should probably skip this phone. If you want an awesomely solid piece of technology in every other way and are willing to look past the few flaws this phone has, then by all means get it, and you won't be disappointed.",39,"Sony"
"2744","B07H6V8TB9",3,"true","The phone is as slippery as a bar of soap. The whole thing is made of gorilla glass. My S8 active had a plastic screen to prevent cracking. They could have made it out of plastic. The seat of my jeep pushed it out of my pocket when I hopped out, because there is NOTHING for the cotton to hold on to when it is in my pocket. The back of the phone broke, a day before I got the case for it. Oh yeah, I need a reciept for the insurance plan to replace it. There is no way to get a reciept for the company, from Amazon.

"2745","B07H6V8TB9",5,"true","I think cell phones are really about personal preference, what I like may not be the same for someone else. Let me start with the fingerprint scanner, it is in a perfect place for me. I don't have huge hands and due to the length, I'm not stretching my finger around to find the scanner, I have never accidentally hovered over the camera. One on the other things I love is the camera system. How many phones come with a dedicated camera button? This was a feature I missed on my previous phone. The camera itself is located in such a great position. I've haven't accidentally taken a picture of my finger when holding it in landscape mode. The system is snappy and fluid. The screen looks awesome. I just wish manufactures would bring back the headphone jack. This was a bundle purchase with the xperia duo headset. At first they were awkward to put on but after a few tries you get used to them quickly. They don't seal into the ear like my other headset which is nice. They sound amazing. Overall this is a great phone and headset. I really love this phone, I'm glad I didn't listen to all of the negative reviews.",3,"Sony"

"2749","B07H6V8TB9",5,"true","All I can is wow!! This is my first Sony phone and I absolutely love it. The screen is the best I've ever seen on a phone before. I'm coming from a LG V30 and with that device, I felt like I could never get the screen comfortable enough for my eyes. It was either too bright or too dark.. But with this OLED screen everything is bright, punchy, and clear right out of the box! Now I'll admit the lack of headphone jack put me off at first, however it comes with adapter in the box which is great and very helpful. I'll say this though be prepared to update multiple times. I believe I restarted and went through 5 or 6 Xperia updates before I was up to calendar. However if you love Sony like I do, would like a phone with a beautiful screen that's great for traveling and watching Netflix on.. Then get this! I couldn't be happier with it!",2,"Sony"
"2750","B07H6V8TB9",1,"true","Less than 3 months after receiving this phone it is crashing. Data turning on and off, rebooting itself...tried resetting internet connections, new SIM card, and finally did a factory reset. Nothing worked, the hardware itself was bad. After spending 3-4 days with Sony tech people telling me to do troubleshooting I had already done, I finally get told to email them all my info including IMEI and they will send a return authorization for repair. Not even a replacement phone, a repair. I emailed the requested info. Received nothing for several more days. Called in because the chat feature (which supposedly is open 9-8pm) never works, and no one responds to emails (I emailed multiple times). I was told I would receive the return authorization within the next day; auto email followup said within 48 hours. Three days later, still nothing. I had to call in again, and the guy said I would receive it within 3 hours. Still nothing. Next day, I call in again. This time I get angry, and another guy actually sends me the Fedex shipping label within an hour. So now I go to Fedex where I have to pay for my own box, and discover they only have shipping loss coverage for up to $100; the form says I can add extra to that, but Fedex says ""no, that would have to be applied at the time the shipping label was created."" So apparently if my new $600 phone gets lost or damaged in the mail, I'll just be out $500. And the real kicker is that I probably won't have it back for two weeks. While the phone itself is lovely (beautiful screen) and it has good sound quality, I would advise people to steer clear of it. The camera is good as well, but really only for close-ups. The zoom is not good. Not at all worth the hassle and weeks without use of a new phone. Update: I sent my device off to Sony for repair, and they sent it back in exactly the same condition. It doesn't work. They refuse to replace the phone. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, they hung up on me.",NA,"Sony"
"2751","B07H6V8TB9",5,"true","I've had a good number of Sony Xperia Phones: - Sony Ericsson, Xperia ZL, Xperia Z3, Xperia XZ (most recent) The Xperia XZ3 is a better replacement for my Xperia XZ. For comparison basis, I'll be referring to my previous phone the Xperia XZ. Battery Life: With a single charge at 11pm, I immediately unplugged the device. I started to use the phone starting at 6am. I was able to use the XZ3 nearly all day and still have at least 55% by midnight. -I've streamed music for at least 8 hours -Connected my bluetooth headset -at least 3 to 4 hours of screen time (emails, texting, web search, and netflix) by 8pm I was at 60% charge. It's close to midnight now and it the phone is still at 49% charge. Battery Stamina is set to kick in at 45%. If I didn't charge this phone tonight, It will likely last till 12pm. In short you can expect at least 1 day and 12 hours from a single charge with normal usage. Picture Quality: The quality is on par if not better than the Xperia XZ. Even though it was a step down in Camera Spec, the image stabilization, and software processing makes up for the gap in quality. Sound Hands down the best out of any Xperia phone. It may rival the bigger flag ships in terms of quality and clarity. Connectivity: For ATT Network customers, this phone is LTE Compatible! You will receive and achieve full LTE speeds offered by ATT. This was one of my biggest fear was being stuck with H+ instead of LTE. -Phone call clarity is much better. The reception on is much clearer to the receiver and you will be able to hear better as well. Side note: if you buy this phone now 6/2019, you will have to update your phone. There are at least 7 major updates to the OS. That's a good thing but it takes some time. So be patient it is well worth the wait.

"2765","B07H6V8TB9",5,"false","You will be impressed with the awesome screen on this phone. And the sound is quite impressive as well. The fingerprint scanner works more reliably than what I've had on other phones, e.g. when my fingers are a little wet. Overall the quality of pretty much every detail is high. The performance of the camera in low light surprised me. I went into a room dark enough that I would definitely want to turn on the light (overcast day with blinds closed) and took a picture. It used a long exposure, and the resulting photo looks like I took it on a normal day. This was without a tripod; I was just holding the camera (still) in my hands, so I'm assuming that image stabilization helped out. I'm used to quite the opposite, that in low light photos are far worse than what I see with my eyes. Also, someone complained about the lack of WiFi calling. If you have Google Voice, you can make calls over WiFi on this phone -- it works great. And if you don't already know about Google Voice, you're missing out; get it and enjoy WiFi calling. I see tons of complaints about the fingerprint scanner being too low, but I think I know why they put it where they did, and it makes sense to me. On my old phone the scanner was higher, close to the camera, and the camera *always* had fingerprints on it. On this phone, the scanner is right in the center, so if you register your fingerprints from the side you can easily find the scanner and spare the camera. You'll only be unhappy with the placement of the scanner if you insist on coming at it from the bottom. The curved back has plusses and minuses. On the plus side, it feels really good in the hand, because you are not holding the phone just by the edges -- more of the back surface makes contact with your hand. That also makes it less likely to slip out of your hand. However, what is good for your hand is bad for everything else -- when you put the phone on a flat surface, it is resting on just a point. I have had the phone slide off of a surface that I thought was flat and hit the floor. I took that as a warning, so now a phone case is on the way. I'm still on the fence about Sony's ""Side-Sense"" feature. It's handy when it works, but I seem to have trouble invoking it when I want it, and too often it comes up when I didn't mean for it to. I'm giving it a few weeks to decide whether I should just disable it. One of my favorite things about the camera is that it is water-resistant. The last phone I bought began a slow decline after I got caught by surprise with some rain. I immediately put the camera (which was in a silicone case) in my pocket, but my pants got damp. The video on the phone started acting weird the next day, and over the next month or so it eventually gave out, rendering the phone useless. With the XZ3 I won't have to worry about that kind of thing -- there's an AndroidPit video on YouTube in which a guy runs an XZ3 (that is capturing video) through a dishwasher cycle.

"2779","B07HQTWQVT",4,"true","Replaced my Blackberry Priv with this Sony XA2 with Verizon as my provider. I prefer the smaller 5.2 inch screens, bigger is not always better. I got the blue one which is a nice metallic sky blue. It is NOT a slow phone, even with the 3gb ram - I use it to text, google map, and phone so caveats apply. The screen is great, responsive, and strong. Camera is great, albeit I didn't get it for that. Apps are good, and not loaded with bloatware. It also has some nice pre-loaded ring tones as well. The phone is a little bit too smooth so get a case for it. I got this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0792339PK which is really nice and grips well and still lets the colour of the phone through. It does have a slight lip so the phone screen doesn't rest directly on a the surface when face-down. Setting it up with Verizon was initially tricky and likely something I caused because it should be straightforward, right? It would not register with Verizon on startup. Solution: don't call Verizon, they know very little about this phone since they do not sell it, which is a pity, it is a really nice phone. Anyway, google Sony Xperia Companion and download the Sony Companion software. There is an option to reset/restore your phone - keep in mind, this will reset/wipe the phone so make sure you still have any data you copied across to the phone if you did that first. Connect to the pc/mac with the provided cable and follow the instructions. Then follow the Verizon instructions to update your phone on your account. After doing this, the phone registered on Verizon with the first startup. Not a problem since then",17,"Sony"
"2780","B07HQTWQVT",1,"true","I mean. If you're on a budget... It's a good phone. The battery doesn't last nearly as long as that lead you to believe it does. Also. The phone is SUPER thick. And for it being Gorilla glass 4 the screen scratches extremely easy. Got two within the first few weeks. With a case with bumpers. Also case scratch the sides bad and chip the aluminum paint. And the Camera is absolutely terrible. 23 mp is TOO MUCH. you can't focus it. It's blurry. The quality is so poor for the MP. I do not recommend buying this phone for the camera specs. You will be highly let down. Go for a One plus. If I could return this phone. Believe I would. I'm having and impossible time trying to sell it for more then 50$.",22,"Sony"

I decided to upgrade to this years XA2 and it's wonderful. It's a simply beautiful phone. I haven't had any problems with it whatsoever and I would totally buy this phone again UPDATE Over A YEAR AND A HALF later!! THIS IS THE BEST PHONE. BAR NONE!

"2789","B07HQTWQVT",1,"true","I received this phone about 2 months ago as replacement since the phone that I originally bought was sold to me as new ended up being used. The reason I am aware of this is because I have already owned a couple Xperia phones in the past and found out the hard way that the screens cannot be replaced. If you do, The screen will start to turn yellow in a month or two. When I contacted Amazon I explained to the rep what you read above but was told since it has been over 30 days they cannot take responsibility . I then contacted Xperia and was greeted by a rep that was very hard to understand due to the language barrier. Even after I explained the issue about the screen turning yellow she still wanted to walk me through about 20 minutes of trouble shooting to rule out a software problem. I was then told that I had to ship my phone to them to get the screen replaced and this would take about 14 business days and that I had to find a phone to use during this time. I'm the kind of person that doesn't get mad about things like this but I do feel let down by Sony for not backing up their product and Amazon for not taking care of their customers.

"2792","B07HQTWQVT",2,"true","I bought this phone to replace my 3 year old Samsung Galaxy S6 (the bad one), and this phone is just OK compared to that Samsung. You get what you pay for! As of when I write this, this phone does not have the option to adjust screen touch sensitivity. How can you leave that out! The headphone jack is on the top of the phone instead of on the bottom. This is absolutely wretched if you listen to music via aux cable/headphones. Also when I plug this phone into my car via the aux cord, if you touch the phone screen, a crazy whistling/humming noise emits through my car speakers. This was never an issue on any other phone I've owned. I used to use Amazon Prime music to listen to the music that's on my phone. With this phone, that app simply does not work. It pauses and freezes randomly and will not auto play the next song in line until I turn the screen on.....while driving. This was also never an issue with the S6. I contacted Amazon about this and they said it's a problem with the phone. I also cannot block users from calling and texting me on this phone, again no problems doing that on any other phone. Come on Sony! I love your TVs and game systems, but this phone is embarrassing! You will want to get some kind of case for this phone because if you are the person who messes with your phone while it sits on a flat surface, the phone moves around on the surface and won't stay put on its own. Almost like it has a balance point. I haven't been able to figure out the camera yet, but taking photos is really slow and they're always out of focus. This is likely a user error, because I have heard the cameras on these phones are pretty good. On a positive note this phone does feel good and somewhat light in my hand.

I like the size/design overall, although I wish it was a bit smaller (I don't think there are many phones these days that are smaller than this). There are some features from the Moto X that I miss, and the swipe keyboard on this phone seems more sensitive and ""dumber"" at guessing what you're trying to type. Thus why I deducted a star.

I also wanted one which was reasonably priced. Full disclosure, I am upgrading from a 5 year old Nexus 4 I bought from Google. This phone is only slightly bigger then my old one. The setup program was easy and straight forward, but at the end of it, your only option was ""I accept"". Your stuck, there is no other button available. Even if you don't check any of the options. But this is probably true of everyone else I'm sure. I decided on the different case then the one the Bundle suggested. It is made by Tudia, and sounded like it was slightly better made. I am pleased with that too. Make sure you get a case for the ""regular"" XA2 and NOT one for the ""XA2 Ultra"". That phone is physically larger. That doesn't matter for many accessories, but obviously does for a case or wallet. I also ordered a 2 meter USB-C cable so I can use it for GPS navigation in my car. I did forget to order an nano SD card, you'll need at least one. The built in 32GB memory could be tight if you use a lot of memory hungry apps. about 11GB are taken be the operating system.

"2833","B07HQTWQVT",2,"true","I did a lot of research trying to find a phone that wouldn't break the bank. I guess I'm old school, but I'm not paying a thousand bucks for something that fits in your pocket that doesn't include diamonds. I had a Samsung Galaxy 5 with 16gb and was constantly removing programs to make room for anything else. Heck, with all the bloat ware from google I only had 3 to 4gb for my programs. Stuff I don't use I couldn't remove. So I decided to buy something that started off with32gb and yes I know the new phones can have 64gb, but there's that fit in your pocket, no diamond thing. So Apple and Samsung was not in the running for me. I started looking at Sony. I noticed they had some issues with the XA1, but Sony addressed those issues with this XA2. It's a nice phone and it came with Android Oreo right off the bat. There are some programs I don't use, but I can remove them when and if I need the space. Update April 24, 2018 Sony had a large update last week and since then I've been having Bluetooth problems. First, my phone won't sync up to my Bluetooth enabled Panasonic car stereo. I installed the latest firmware for the radio, but still nothing. My radio sees the phone, it even links up with Spotify and BT audio, but there is no sound. Radio displays songs being played and everything just no volume. I reinstalled the apps on the phone, still nothing. I contacted Sony and they gave me the standard ""Restart the phone"" bs. They then said to do a factory reset, pain in the butt, but I did it. Still nothing. I contacted Sony again and they told me the same things again. Today Sony contacted me and said it would have to go in to repair. I asked if they could just replace it. It's just over a month old. I cannot be without a phone with my job. I know having a Bluetooth issue is small, but it's a brand-new phone!! I've been troubleshooting it. I got my son's Samsung phone with Spotify and it played perfectly! I disabled Sony Xperia Assist, a program that was updated with the big update. This program will save power by not disturbing you during certain hours. When I disabled it, I get some Bluetooth capabilities. I tried telling Sony all this, but I'm just talking to someone going down the list and not a real tech support person. I hate that. All this is why I moved my rating from a solid 5 stars to 2 stars. I swear if I figure this out without their help, I should charge them for fixing their product. I'll give them a couple of more days, then I'll lower my rating of this phone. **Update 3/17/2018** Still love the phone, but I noticed that when I'm trying to scroll I'm constantly activating links that my finger lands on when scrolling. (Does that make sense?) Battery life is still Great!! What to expect: Inside the box is the phone, a cord to charge it, and a wall adapter, and a real quick start guide. And that's it! There's no earphones even though Sony kept the earphone jack. What I really like about the phone is: The price. For a newly introduced phone, it only cost me $346! Not everyone has one (I have a Sony Reader instead of the popular Kindle) The graphics are spectacular! The battery life is great also. I get two days off one charge and it charges in about 30 to 45 min from nearly dead. It links up seamlessly with my car radio, which wasn't always the case with the Samsung. Other things to know: It takes the newer USB C cable to charge it (which is cool because it fits in either way) (Yes, the new phones (and the Switch) come with the C cable, but there's that diamond thing again.) The casing is slick and with the curved glass, I'm affraid I'll drop the thing. (You can't go down to Walmart to buy a case for it yet (or ever)) I ordered one from Amazon, but it hasn't arrived yet. Screen protectors either don't cover the entire screen, because of the curved screen, or don't stick well. It takes a smaller SIM than what was in my Samsung, so I had to run to T-Mobile in the middle of the night to get one (They were going to charge me $25, but when they pulled up my account and saw that I've been with them since 1999 they waived the charge.) I've had it for about a week and I'm happy with it, but I'll update as I find out more about it",43,"Sony"
"2834","B07HQTWQVT",3,"true","I didn't want to go the Samsung/Apple latest greatest route as I just can't justify the cost anymore. I wanted to find a cheaper Android alternative that was a bit smaller form factor with decent performance and niceties such as fingerprint sensor and NFC (for Google Pay). The Xperia XA2 is a nice phone with distinctive styling that makes it stand out from the rest. It is a bit less tall and wide although a bit thicker and a tad heavier. The added thickness accommodates the battery, which provides excellent life. With moderate use throughout the day, I still have 70% life left. As mentioned prior, the NFC was important to me as I have become rather accustomed to mobile payments like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. I have to say that Google Pay is even easier to use than its competitors...just unlock the phone and it's ready to use. After starting the phone the first time it went through some updates and is now on Android 8. The phone is snappy with no lag. The volume through the headphone jack is sub-par, but is pretty decent through its speaker. Bluetooth sound is quite good as well if not a bit too bass-heavy. I'm still working on getting decent photos with the camera although I think that is the user and not necessarily the camera. The phone works great. Calls are clear and the phone, contacts, and messaging apps all work well. The phone uses the Swiftkey keyboard and you can also use Google voice transcription. This is a feature that is a little kludgy. You can't easily switch between the two...it takes a few touches to toggle each. The fingerprint sensor worked great the first few days and now is a little finicky. It is like any other sensor where your finger needs to be clean, dry, etc. However, even when my finger is clean and dry, the phone refuses to recognize my print. The more I try, the more it resists until it locks me out. Fortunately, I had set it up to use either the fingerprint or pattern so I can at least get into the phone. The other finicky piece is the cellular and Wifi functionality. It mostly works great until it doesn't. I have a minimum of three bars of LTE and the phone complains there is no Internet. This can happen even with Wifi connected so I'm hopeful this is a software issue that a future update will address. A reboot will usually fix the problem so it's an annoyance but depending on when it happens can be a real pain. Taking everything into consideration I am pretty happy with the phone. If a software update fixes the fingerprint sensor and cellular/wifi issues, this easily gets a five star rating. UPDATE - Had to ditch the Sony and go back to an old phone. The killer for me was the actual phone app. As I was talking to someone with the phone against my ear, it was treating the screen touches as normal interacting rather than ""muting"" the screen presses. Hard to explain, but while I was on a call just my ear dragging across the screen would cause it to open up apps, email, delete and eventually hang up on a call. This had the latest version of Android and yet it was exhibiting behavior of first generation smartphones. I'm sure if I had spent enough time using Tasker or finding another phone app, I could have found a workaround, but that was just a deal killer for me.",2,"Sony"

The Sony skin on it isn't terrible like touchwiz on Samsungs. I thought it was easier to manipulate in the ol' Android way. It's not stock Android but it does the trick. The battery life on this for light users is about 2 days. My mother gets about 3 days out of it from what she tells me and I trust her 92%. This is one of the best phones you can get under 400 USD",2,"Sony"
"2836","B07HQTWQVT",5,"true","Sony finally has a fingerprint scanner phone available in the US. Bought as a present for my wife. She loves it. Nice styling. I wasn't sure what my wife would think of the larger phone (XA2 Ultra), so I bought this one. Now I know she wouldn't mind, but we'll keep this one and for some reason, the XA2 Ultra doesn't come in pink, so she is happy with this one. I was able to root it using Magisk, so I appreciate the fact that Sony allows their phones' bootloader to be unlocked.",5,"Sony"
"2837","B07HQTWQVT",1,"true","This phone developed a major hot spot above the sim card slot in just over a month! I couldn't return it to Amazon and had to contact Sony for a warranty fix. Sony agreed to fix it but they took 3 weeks just to get the phone back to me. Less than a month later an even bigger hot spot appeared in the same spot and started spreading. To make things worse, the battery life since the hot spots developed is noticeably less than when I first got the phone. The phone barely lasts through the afternoon and basically needs to be charged twice a day. The hot spots and the battery life have gotten so bad that I need to get it fixed again. Sony wants me to send the phone back to them, to attempt a fix it a second time. Their tech support is in Latin America and there is a significant delay between contacting them and receiving a response. It makes the whole process very aggravating, as so many details need to be explained again and again just to make the issue clear to their support representatives. Then the actual repair of the phones also takes forever! They allow themselves 14 business days to get the phone back to you, which they use all of three weeks to do. If I send the phone back for a second repair, it will mean that over the 6 months I've owned this phone, it will have been in their repair shop for 1 whole month! It's completely absurd. My ""new"" phone has felt like a junky old phone for most of the time I've had it.",NA,"Sony"
"2838","B07HQTWQVT",1,"true","I recieved the phone April 4th, 2019 and I haven't had any issues with it. It was a HUGE upgrade from the last phone that I had. I was please with the camera quality. How quick the phone was to do anything. The screen was so much clearer than the last phone I had. Call quality was fantastic. I had zero complaints. Then today (May 15, 2019) the phone spontaneously began resetting itself, over and over again, for the past half an hour. It's extremely inconvenient because this was the issue I was having with my last phone, but I had it for over a year. I feel like I should have gotten a cheap clamshell phone and called it a day.",2,"Sony"
"2839","B07HQTWQVT",5,"true","I like this phone. With all the new phones coming out right now, the prices are way too expensive. With the price, it is really a good phone. It is fast, and I did not have any issues using it the first time. It is an unlock phone and that is a plus. All I did was insert my straight talk sim card and it worked perfectly. I did not have to call my service provider. This certain phone uses only GSM carriers so it may not work for CDMA ones. If you travel overseas, most countries are using GSM network so this phone is perfect for you and will save you money in the long run. The good thing about using unlock phone is you are not obligated to stay with your carrier if you are not happy with their service anymore. You can switch to another one as long as they are using a GSM network. If anyone who avoids using locked phones, Sony has a great deal for it. It is not a popular phone in the US but they have good quality. It has really good camera and it takes 4K video. Also, it has a good battery life. You will notice that the phone is somewhat heavy compare to other phones but it does not bother me a bit. Overall, I am very happy with this phone.",NA,"Sony"

"2845","B07HQTWQVT",4,"false","A decent mid-range Android smartphone with a smaller screen and good features is getting surprisingly difficult to find. This one checks a lot of boxes, but misses in a few. My first impression of this phone is how surprisingly thick it is. Part of this is due to the large battery in a 5.2"" screen phone (3300 mAh). It does feel good in the hands. Good grip, feels hefty despite the plastic back, thanks to the large battery. It feels slippery though, so one of the first thing I did was to buy a case. I bought a Sony Xperia XA2 Case, TopACE Ultra Thin Carbon Fiber Scratch Resistant Shock Absorption Soft TPU Protective Cover for Sony Xperia XA2 (Black) purely based on price and it fits well. You don't get a number of things that comes with a top of the line phone. You don't get Qualcomm's current top of the line processor (you get a Snapdragon 630). You don't get an OLED screen, no 18:9 display, no wireless charging, no water resistance, and thank goodness you don't get a notch either, and you still have your headphones jack. You do get a beautiful IPS display with no bezels at the sides. For some reason, the default setting doesn't really show off the beautiful color the screen is capable of displaying. You need to go into settings, display, color gamut and contrast, and choose either standard or super vivid mode. Reds are visibly enhanced in standard mode, and vivid appears to increase contrast and saturation. There's a fingerprint sensor at the back of the phone. It's not as fast as the one on my OnePlus 3T, but ~1 second is not bad. It seems pretty consistent in recognizing my fingerprint too (based on 2 weeks of use so far). The back is almost flat (very slight curve) with the camera lens protruding just a little. The glass is slightly recessed within a bezel for protection, but a case will recess it more so you don't have to worry as much about scratching it. Speaking of camera, this phone comes with a 23 MP rear camera. While impressive on paper (it has a higher resolution than my full frame DSLR), having to squeeze so many pixels into a small sensor means that it doesn't do well in low light. The f/2.0 lens is not bad, but not as wide as others that let's in more light. Samsung S9 is a much more expensive phone, but just using it for example, the f/1.5 lens lets in about twice as much light. The front selfie camera has an interesting feature. If you raise your hand and the camera recognizes it, it will start a short countdown timer to take your picture, just enough time for you to put down your hand. Both cameras are decent, especially under bright conditions, and the rear camera can take 4K video. Just don't be too swayed by 23 MP. The camera uses a nano SIM card. You can pull out the SIM drawer with your fingernails. However, the phone will reboot when you do that, and reboot again when you push it back in. This is a problem, because the same compartment holds the microSD card, meaning you cannot insert or remove the microSD card without rebooting the phone. If you want to store photos and videos on the card, you need to select that within the camera app. The XA2 comes with 3GB of RAM (the XA2 Ultra has 4GB) and 32GB of storage. However, you only get to use about half of that, as 45% of the storage is used by OS and apps, and there's no way to uninstall the factory apps (you can disable them). Some apps it comes with are Amazon Kindle, Amazon Shopping, AVG Protection (virus, malware, phishing protection) and other Sony software. One feature that surprised me is a FM radio tuner. You need to plug in wired headphones to use this (it uses that as antenna) and works quite well. It also has NFC. It doesn't support wireless charging, but does support Quickcharge 3.0 through the USB C port. Overall, I feel that this is a very nice mid-range 5.2"" phone with a beautiful screen. If you don't mind a larger phone, I think the XA2 Ultra is a better value, especially with more RAM.",13,"Sony"
"2846","B07HQTWQVT",2,"true","I'll try to keep this review short and to the point to help you to make a better decision. I've waited for about a month since sony announced the release of this phone to the market and bought it on the first day Amazon sold it, since than its about a month and the amazing customer service department of Amazon replaced it to what have seem to be defective phone and here's the primery cons of the XA2. - WiFi calling is NOT available (with T-mobile), many people use their phones in places were cellular reception is blocked or doesn't work such as hospitals, home depot, target stores etc' on the other hand these places offer you to login their wifi network (with draconian terms) however if you are in the hospital or in home depot you can make and receive calls. I've spent 4 or 5 days on the phone and back and forth emails with Sony 's customer service which blamed T-mobile that the feature doesn't work were in the devices which I owned (all unlocked and none sold by t-mobile) at the past 5 years the wifi calling worked great. T-mobile replaced 2 Sim cards, I talked twice with the engineering team and the wifi calling still doesn't work. Finally sony wrote in their email that I'm entitled to return tge phone to the store I bought it from within 14 days. So I thought that maybe I got a lemon and Amazon kindly replaced it (10 stars for Amazon customer service) and even with the replacement it still doesn't work! Other cons.... The ""great camera"" which was the primary reason I got this phone at first place isn't that great at all. It's got ghosting issues, it's lagging really bad and it's impossible to focus it properly at 10 sec or less. The device is FULL of bloatware which you cannot uninstall without rooting the device which will void the warranty. After 2 weeks with less than 10 apps installed (not counting the Android and bloatware sony added) the xa2 started to lag like a 3 year old phone. And another issue is the limited selection of protective cases which are important to some users. The PROS of this device are the design which in cool, the price is great, the battery if you disabled all the bloatware and garbage under the hood can be on standby for 2 days (who let's the phone on standby for 2 days?) Personally I hope that Sony will fix all the issues of what was planned to be a great mid range and useful phone that turned (in my case) to be unuseful dumbphone without very important features (wifi calling, amazing sony camera)",5,"Sony"
"2847","B07HQTWQVT",1,"true","I tried switching from an iphone and found that the sound quality on android video recordings is terrible. Almost like a flanger/phaser sound,that I think has to do with some shoddy noise reduction system they have set up. I got the phone hoping to improve on an old iphone 5s camera, but returned this one and went back to the older phone.",NA,"Sony"
"2848","B07HQTWQVT",1,"false","My Xperia XA2 died on me while out of state on vacation. The cellular modem failed -- wifi still worked, but I wasn't able to make or receive phone calls; likewise, text messages would not go through (""mobile network unavailable""). This was after only five months of use. Equally as frustrating as the short lifespan of this phone (and bad timing) has been Sony's terrible support. I bought the phone despite seeing numerous posts from folks on Sony's support forums indicating that Sony no longer stands behind their product, and my experience so far is not reassuring. The phone support folks will offer ""Sony will stand by your side"" banalities, but here's what the support process looks like so far: multiple phone calls just to get them to admit that this is a hardware failure and the phone needs to be replaced. When they finally agreed to open a warranty repair case, I was warned I should allow 14 business days for the repair -- and that does not include time in shipping. Two days later, I still didn't have instructions on where to ship the phone for warranty service, just an email asking if ""after knowing all the process you want to continue"" (sic). YES, I WOULD STILL LIKE YOU TO HONOR YOUR WARRANTY. Update as of August 2018: finally got the phone back from the repair center today, unrepaired. Note from technician said they could not reproduce the problem, but phone was ""repaired."" The cellular modem on the phone is still dead -- no SIM cards work in this phone. Until the cellular modem died, I had been relatively happy with the phone. The battery life is fantastic -- if I forgot to put it on the charger at night, no big deal - I could often get two days of use on a full charge. It was a nice change from my old Nexus 5X, where the battery would be dead by dinner time. I also like the XA2's form factor -- it's hard to find Android phones that aren't gigantic. And having a micro SD slot to use for add-on storage was nice. That's about it for this phone's selling points, though. Software updates weren't as regular as I was used to with my Nexus, and the camera is mediocre. To some extent, the mediocre camera is to be expected from a mid-range phone. But the camera always seemed to take forever and a day to start and there were some bad early firmware issues with sound quality on video recordings. I was interested in using the phone's FM radio, but reception was poor, especially if the screen was on. These are annoyances, though -- if the phone hadn't died on me after a mere five months of use (and Sony's support wasn't so awful), I would have given the phone 4/5. But it did die young, and their support really is as bad as folks on the support forums tried to warn me. So, 1/5 it is.",7,"Sony"
"2849","B07HQTWQVT",5,"false","Outstanding reception, the right size, beast camera, very clear images! Great battery life, phone itself has a lot of useful features pre-installed like battery care, it recognize what time you plug, hence unplug and it uses different charging speed to extend overall battery life spin, when taking photos - both camera has feature like raise hand when camera is pointing for a second like you are saying Hi and it will in a 2 seconds snaps the shot itself, you don't need to keep hand raised, again just for a second, the kind of circle appears on screen telling you that it recognize to make a self shot. I think it's a great idea other than to put self timer for 10 seconds and stretching smile antill it clicks, speaker is not that loud like XA Ultra from 2017 but very clear and decent. Design is very SONY-isch and eye catching. I pre-order xa2 from SONY website and was delivered to me by best buy. I am very impressed and decided to review it here. Had owned other brands too past few years, by far the best! I will keep it until it breaks. I am not gonna look for new upcoming models for a long. Do not buy tempered glass screen protector for this model as it will not fit! It is very slightly carved on edges and will end up with spaces on both edges, so get the regular screen protector FILM (not the protector glass). Mine included wall charger and cable, no headphones. I pair this phone with SONY MDRXB80BS Bluetooth acoustic noise canceling earbuds that has LDAC, I can not hear anything other than music!",3,"Sony"
"2850","B07HQTWQVT",4,"false","Takeaway: This phone is a totally serviceable option while you wait for the next big tech to come out. Get the silver, the silver is eye-catching and unique looking. Bought this last-minute after CES 2019 when I realized that the first legit Samsung folde-able phone/tablet will hit in March this year instead of a year or two away. Returned my Pixel 3 XL to save the extra $600 and opted for the best-looking, purest, $200-ish phone available ( that's how much this was last night ). The bad: 32GB might matter to you. Doesn't to me. If you're coming from something high-end like a Pixel 3 this will feel noticeably slower. You can tap on developer mode in the settings and drop the animation delays to 50% duration which zips it up a bit. The buttons and button placement. They're dumb. I've turned this on and off by accident a ton of times already including at Starbucks while holding the phone out to pay. I don't know if this is a byproduct of the quality of mic hardware used, the slower processor, or some kind of software optimization that only runs on the Pixel, but voice dictation, including interacting w/ Google Assistant, is much touchier, slower, and less mind-blowing on the Sony than on the Pixel 3 XL. I realize this is an unfair comparison given that one's $200 and one's $800-1000. But this review is written from the perspective of can a grown man or woman who likes tech be satisfied w/ this phone for a short while ( in my case a few months ). So if you're a Google Assistant fanatic like me, be prepared to speak much more loudly and clearly when interacting w/ this phone and to wait a lot longer ( though sometimes it gets in a zone and works quickly ). I already miss the latest Android. I'd gotten so used to the swipe up to multitask on my Pixel that multitasking feels annoying on the Sony, but only slighty annoying, I can deal. The good: Battery life. OH MY HOLY HELL YOU GUYS. Used it for 6ish hours in bed last night ON THE FIRST NIGHT and I kid you not battery was STILL SOMEHOW at 80% when I was done. This includes setting the phone up from scratch and installing 2 dozenish apps, streaming YouTube, and doing a lot of Chrome. Bloatware: There's some, mostly a handful of apps that you can ""disable"" but not uninstall including things like Facebook, but once you do, and MOST IMPORTANTLY once you install Evie launcher the phone instantly feels much classier, more pure, and like what Android SHOULD look like on a small phone. I've read that some other phones have all kinds of ""hey this is kind of android kind of something else!"" software add ons to deal w/. So far my only big complaint is the ugly dual-sized text of the clock on the lock screen. Also would be cool if Sony replaced the font system-wide w/ something sexier and more modern looking. The screen is shockingly good for the price. I'm a HUGE OLED FAN, LIKE I'M OBSESSED WITH OLED, but I'm not going to lie, and I can't explain why, but holding it side by side w/ my Pixel 3 XL ( this is in a completely dark room in bed last night as I was setting it up and deciding what to install ), I preferred the clarity of the Sony. THIS UPSETS ME TOO AND I DON'T KNOW WHY, but the text just looked better. Sharper somehow, even though I'm pretty sure the DPI is much higher on the Pixel. Also really great about this phone is the look of it if you get silver. Made my Pixel feel generic and overly playful by comparison, and this is a weird thing I noticed, the purely square corners of the screen make the phone somehow *feel* more high-end despite its slower performance than the rounded corners of the Pixel 3 XL. One thing I already miss is the squeeze to Google Assistant on the Pixel. I wish all phones had that. Anyway, at $200 if how the phone physically looks is at all a consideration to you, this can't really be beat. Some other great options at this price point like the Moto G6, a Nokia or two, and a few others, but this ( again my comments are for silver only ) looks much higher-end in person ( after sampling about 30 phones at BB last night before making a decision ) and has the unique advantage of being super pocketable. It's noticeably slower and less instantaneous feeling than the Pixel 3 XL I'm returning, but sometimes, when it's in a zone and being zippy [ make sure to turn stamina mode and some other settings off if performance is your top priority ) it's actually somehow MORE FUN to use. The square screen is an underrated benefit as a lot of phones are doing rounded corners now, the square screen somehow makes it feel higher-end in use. I would pay $300 for this phone. Take care folks.",1,"Sony"

"2871","B07HQTWQVT",5,"true","UPDATE: I've used this phone for almost 2 months now and wanted to update my review for any would-be phone buyers out there. My previous review still stands. Camera is great. Front camera is OK with good light. It's fast for the most part, but I don't game. The one area that could be improved is the antenna. My house is like a cell reception dead zone, but this phone seems especially weak compared to other phones. I don't know why, but anywhere else it's fine. I can't knock it down a star just for that because I don't have an explanation for it, but it's worth mentioning. Overall, I really like the phone and the battery life is way better than advertised. I'm easily getting 2 days and it charges fast. There's also some predictivity that I like. For example, if I turn off my weekday alarm it will tell me my normal alarm is off and if I want to turn it on. It's saved me a few times. _________________ I spent months researching phones because the camera on my old phone was terrible. Having a 4 year old requires being able to take decent pictures. After a lot of spec checking and considering other phones like the Moto X4, Moto G5S, Honor 8, Honor 7x, HTC U11 Life, Asus Zenfone 4, One Plus 5T I ended up buying the Sony XA2. Here's are my reasons. My top reason was the camera and after a lot of research the Sony is on top in this category. All these other phones have dual cameras which sounds like it should be better, but unless you buy a top of the line phone with a ton of ram and a much better processor (and AI) you're phone will eek out mediocre pictures. I think long term, dual cameras will be the norm which is the case on the best phones. It an issue of processing and sensor size. In midrange phones, it less taxing to take a single image without stitching 2 images together. Another issue I'm having with a lot of phones is the obnoxious size. I wanted a slightly smaller screen size. Going forward I'm not getting a screen any larger than 5.5"". The 18:9 ratio like the Honor 7x is an advantage over this phone, but the XA2 sounds very good in the hand. Finally, I had a hard time considering a phone that didn't come with the latest version of Android (Oreo 8.0). Google has a spotty record whether they will push updates to their phones. I originally bought an Honor 8. It was on the list to get Oreo, but who knows if that will happen. I really wanted an Asus Zenfone but from all the reviews I've read their camera has suffered at version 4 and will they actually get Oreo. In any event, I'd recommend this phone. The mid-range phone market is an interesting place to shop because there are lots of choices, but every phone has a trade off. If I were willing to spend more I would have bought the One Plus 5T or if I wanted to risk it I may have bought an Essential Phone. This is my first Sony phone in a very long time and I'm pleased with the purchase.",73,"Sony"

Pros: -Great camera love slowmo -Everything is fast, no lag in sight -Phone fits perfectly in my hand, not too big but not too small. Cons: -I'm having a lot of trouble focusing with the camera on anything relatively close and detailed.. **update** -apps consistently crash, including core Android processes and applications sometimes required to run the phone properly.. This is a complete make or break problem with this phone and has caused me to update my rating to 2 stars.",29,"Sony"

I did not know that at the time, I was purchasing it from a seller other than Amazon, as it had a 'Reccomended' checkmark. (My bad for not checking) DealsAllDay13 sent me an OpenBox, European Market Dual Sim phone, instead of the described US Market, US Warranty phone as described. Worse, they sent it with the US Market accessories, and paper, as if I wouldn't be able to notice that things had been removed and re-applied, or re-located in the box. ((I recently bought a XA2 Ultra for myself, and know what the default layout of things looks like)) Great phone, careful who you buy from.",2,"Sony"
"2881","B07HQTWQVT",2,"true","Edit - I can't do it anymore. Too many disconnects from the network coupled with Sony's goofy apps/setup makes using this phone a chore. With the Pixel 3a out, there's no competition from Sony. This thing is going to eBay! Old - I've had this phone for 9 months now! For starters, this Xperia is light years better than the Xperia bought a 9 months earlier - that phone was awful! It was nice to get this in my hands and see how much Sony's Android implementation had improved. 90% of the time, this phone makes me happy especially considering the price tag in the absence of Nexus devices. There are a couple weaknesses... The camera is awful, the fingerprint reader doesn't work some of the time, and the brightness seems to be on a logarithmic scale rather than linear. The screen remains on for every ongoing notification (calls, navigation, etc) and turns back on seconds after being turned off. Fortunately, the battery life remains solid! The biggest weakness, and the reason for three stars here, is that mine will regularly disconnect from the TMo network! I see the bars go to nil when I drive with Android Auto (which it faithfully supports) and, worse, get voicemail notifications hours after a call that I never received. My Xperia probably only rings for a quarter of the calls I receive. At this point, friends and family know to shoot me a text asking to call them! I'm in no urgent need to replace the phone but I would return it if I was within the window for it. I'm hopeful Sony will continue to work the kinks out of their Android phones moving forward though I'm not sure I want to roll the dice on a third Xperia.",NA,"Sony"
"2882","B07HQTWQVT",2,"true","I'm a big fan of Sony phones, starting with the Z1 Compact many years ago. And still, they're among the best cameras in phones that aren't huge. Unfortunately, after using the XA2, and ultimately returning it, it will be my last. Starting with the XA1 last year, it seemed like Sony rushed it to market with a lot of software and hardware bugs. The XA1 had a major issue where Bluetooth and wifi were not able to be used simultaneously. No patch was ever released, despite hundreds of users posting about this on the Sony forums. As for the XA2, it has its own bugs. The Smart Lock feature (built into Android) did not work at all. It froze up multiple times and rebooted on its own. And for some reason, Sony randomly decided that this phone will not allow ANY apps to be stored on the SD card (this is not a limitation of Oreo, it's up to the manufacturer - the XA1, for instance, allows applicable apps to be moved to the SD card, and it's running the same version of Oreo). Sony needs to do better Quality testing before releasing their phones. I appreciate their move to upgrade to full HD resolution, and the addition of the fingerprint reader, but the camera is exactly the same as on the XA1. So I returned my XA2 and stuck with the XA1. At least I can move apps to the SD card and save some of the internal storage. Sony has some great things going for it - the dedicated camera shutter button, a simple Android overlay, and a really loyal customer base - but they need to get the basics right and nix the bugs before releasing phones.",6,"Sony"

I am not a super heavy user when I am out and about I usually just check social media here and there play some music while I commute in my car (which is about 30-40 each way) from work. I get home at about 50-ish percent. Camera is meh not the best but certainly not the worst.

The size is also perfect as I hate large phones and the loop design is really great, has nice heft and feels comfortable in the hand.

"2887","B07HQTWQVT",5,"true","First off, I'm a long time iPhone user that switched to Android on a Samsung Note 4, then back to iPhone 7 plus, then back to Android on this wonderful Sony handset. All that said, I'm now a huge Android fan (thanks to Android Oreo) and a lover of Sony handsets. This phone has a nice weight to it that isn't so much heavy as it is just right, with a high quality feel to it. The OS skin is so light weight that it feels very similar to stock Android with a few minor tweaks to the look and feel of the OS, all of which enhance the OS, not cripple it or slow it down like some other skins do. Overall this phone is absolutely worth every penny and then some. If you are looking for stock Android with a few minor tweaks to improve on an amazing OS, with a phone that feels like it is worth hundreds more, look no further--you found the right phone for you.",19,"Sony"

The battery, the screen, and the camera are all good for the price I paid for it about about a year ago for 199.99 dollars. Now it costs 299.99 dollars after a year.

I even tried technical support from Amazon, but whoever was on there didn't even know what WiFi Calling is (how she qualifies to work for technical support and not know something one step above basic knowledge like that...)Anyway...if you have TMobile or ATT, I would highly recommend. Great price, middle of the road specs that is still fast and pretty looking to rival the high end phones, and only 25-30% the cost. Also has NFC, screen mirroring, updates to Android 8.0.

The fingerprint scanner is super fast and will only respond to one of my fingers, my other index finger wont even open it! The battery went fast on the first day, but I download and updated about 40 apps so that's more my fault than the phone. The pictures with the back camera are mind blowing.

And any app I try to install and use that would use the sensor to turn the phone on or off, instead of pressing the power button, is glitchy. Between 4 different apps sometimes they work, other times they don't, which if its all of them, then it must be the phone because all the different apps have the same issue with me trying to use it.

I don't understand why it takes a like 1-3 seconds to take a snap. Forget taking sport shots even in bright light. There's no low-res option if you're just using it for work purpose. 4) the tinny hands-free speaker is painful. This is THE WORST phone I've ever used.

"2976","B07HQTWQVT",2,"true","Sony mobile is not what it used to be anymore. I've had 6 different Xperia phones since their first Android device: Xperia X10. Models such Xperia Ray, Arc, SP and Z3 compact were great, even the mid-range sector was worth it, but this is not the case. Sure, this phone has a stunning design but is too expensive compared to other phones of the same range that are way cheaper and have better performance, like the Huawei Honor 7X for example. Even The Huawei Honor 8, which I got 1 year and a half ago showed better performance than this Xperia and the price was similar. I guess Sony can polish their Android ROM even more, but for now is not acceptable to have an octa-core and still take long to open simple daily apps like Twitter or Whatsapp. Camera was really bad. I had to return this phone because the camera lens was probably damaged or camera is just not good. It could never focus when getting close to an object! The detail is terrible when you take a picture from a normal distance and then zoom it, very blurry and noisy. The camera app is slow, it takes around 3 or 4 seconds to open it for the first time, this is not good when you need to take a fast picture or video. Also, it seems that the processor suffers thermal throttling after using the camera for a while. I was doing a lot of photo and video shot testing, the phone slowed down and the fingerprint scanner also got dummy. I had to restart the phone a couple times to get it back to normal. In conclusion: the phone is physically beautiful, but the performance is average, almost insufficient. As I said, there are more options in the market cheaper than this and with better results. Too bad for Sony because as I mentioned before, they used to make great phones with awesome quality, but this was disappointing.",14,"Sony"
"2977","B07HQTWQVT",1,"true","Be forewarned, Sony keeps updating these phones without properly testing if their updates are safe to use.

"2984","B07MZ2TRTC",4,"false","This is an interesting phone, but only because of its 21:9 screen shape. Otherwise it is unremarkable. The phone is very slippery. It feels solid though...with the exception of the sim card tray. The sim card tray is the flimsiest I have ever seen. It looks like it could break easily. One good thing about the sim card tray is that you don’t need to use a sim card tray removal tool. There’s a fingernail tab instead. There is some bloatware during setup, but luckily you are allowed to unselect it. Battery life seems ok. The first days it seemed to drain faster than I expected. It seemed to be ok after a day or two. This is probably more perception than anything else. The screen is the only thing to really pay attention to about this phone, and it is a mixed bag of good and bad. The screen is just ok. I am used to a higher resolution screen at this point. Sometimes text looks fuzzy and blurry. The larger top bezel and small bottom bezel are surprisingly not an issue. It got used to it immediately, but originally thought the lack of symmetry would bother me. The height of this phone is only slightly larger than my iPhone 7 Plus. If you are used to a phone of that size, you will have no issue. Movies at the correct aspect ratio, and even stretched Youtube videos look great when they fill the entire screen. It is very nice to use all of the screen real estate for once. Generally, this phone feels slow at times. Inertial scrolling is weird and jerky, with lag. On Geekbench, it scored 1351 Single Core, and 4929 Multi-Core. Perhaps the most annoying thing about this phone is how incredibly slow the ambient light sensor reacts to changes in brightness. Sometimes I pull the phone out of my pocket and the screen is on, and it takes thirty seconds for the screen brightness to come up tot he level where it needs to be. There is a higher-end model, the Xperia 1 (not yet released as of April 2019), with this same screen size. Although I have not tried that model, I expect it to fix all of the issues I mentioned in this review. It has more ram, a top of the line processor, and even has Eye Auto Focus!",2,"Sony"

I love the phone, the sleekness and how it fits in my hand. I don't want to use it in one hand. I am not interested in texting with one hand. So, it could be wider and I would be okay.

So far, using this phone has been very responsive and great. I love the fact that it supports an SD card and works on the Verizon network. I have not experienced any slowdowns or lagging. Tested a few games without issues. The camera quality is quite good. I'd say at this price point, you can't beat the quality. It truly does feel like a flagship phone due to the optimizations that have been done to the Android OS. The pop out menu for one handed mode is a nice feature as well. Also, the battery life has held up really nicely. I get a full day's usage out of mine. The form factor is the only thing that takes some getting used to, but it makes using the phone much nicer for reading or watching videos. On standard 16:9 videos you can pinch to zoom if you would like it without black bars. This is done pretty seamlessly. Overall 10/10 for this price. I love the stylish look and design of the device. I do highly recommend this phone. I've upgraded from an LG V20 and I'm not looking back any time soon.",40,"Sony"

I thought it might have been my fault, but after some research, I found that there are other users with the same issue. I do like this phone, but an unresponsive screen is a deal breaker.",36,"Sony"
"2990","B07MZ2TRTC",2,"true","Just got it a few hours ago, writing this review from my Galaxy 8 and will be returning the Xperia shortly. Honestly, it's not a bad phone but it's not a great one either.. and for the price I expected it to be a little better considering the competition in the same price range. Using it after having a s8 for 2 years felt like a downgrade especially the screen resolution and color saturation (LCD vs AMOLED). Also One UI just feels more intuitive and advanced, but that's my preference. Watching a video on this thing was really nice tho, the screen aspect ratio did make for a great viewing experience. Camera is not good. Telefoto 2x zoom was cool, but overall I expected alot more from a Sony camera considering they make great cameras. I know it's a mid-range phone but 4k video is one of the selling points of this phone. My biggest disappointment was finding out that Sony does not even enable PS4 remote play on this phone. The only reason I even considered a Sony phone was to use it for remote play with my PS4 .. but I guess Sony only enables remote play for their ""flagship"" phones (i.e fork over $1,000 or you're S.O.L). That to me is just greed, as I see no reason they can't enable this feature for their mid-range phones. I get why they wouldn't allow other Android phones to do so (even though they allow iOS users to) but come on... Anyway will be returning this phone.",27,"Sony"

So I don't know what to tell you the value isn't worth it you be better off getting a phone with higher megapixels if you are a photographer otherwise if you are not this might be a good phone for you. But it's not for me. I like how it fits in my hand better and my hand doesn't have to adjust to how large the other phone was but I finally got over the cramps LOL. And I love most of my Xperia.

"2994","B07MZ2TRTC",1,"false","UPDATE 3: Sony returned my ""repaired"" phone after a month. The ""repaired"" phone's screen also stops responding randomly. It is not an isolated issue. See talk(dot)sonymobile(dot)com/t5/Xperia-10-Plus/Touch-screen-problem-10plus/td-p/1372533 UPDATE 2: Sony had my phone for 25 days now. They said the main board had to be replaced to solve the randomly unresponsive touch screen issue. Sony is clearly outside of their promised 14 business days turnaround time with no apologies. The customer service has to be one of the worst in the industry. Even after the case number is assigned to the issue, they still take 2 days to respond. At one point I asked where my phone was and they promised an update within 24 hours, but they didn't respond in over 24 hours so I had to ask again. They said my phone will go out in the next shipment, yet failed to tell me when that is. Two days later still not information on whether it has been shipped back to me. I am very frustrated and angry at Sony. They are clearly loosers and a fringe player in the US smart phones market. Previously, I passed on good deals for One Plus and Razer flagship phones fearing lack of support, and stuck with Sony phones for some fantasy of an efficient warranty coverage should anything go wrong, but, lo and behold, you are in luck, inept support is available Sony too. UPDATE 1: It's been two and a half months using this phone. Screen becomes randomly unresponsive. I have to lock it by pressing the power switch, unlock it with a PIN or fingerprint, and then it works for some time until it becomes unresponsive again. Sometimes I have to lock and unlock it a few times before it starts responding again. It is happening at different times of day, sometimes several times in a row and sometimes it doesn't happen for hours. Sometimes it happens right after I unlock the phone and sometimes in the middle of me using it. I did a data erase complete factory reset of the phone hoping that the problem would go away, but it is still happening. Sony email support takes 1-2 days to respond. 2 days after my initial email they recommended a reset using a PC program called Sony Companion. That, of course, didn't work like the reset from the phone didn't work, which I report to them the same day. Another two days pass by, they ask for IMEI. I provide it to them the same day. Another day passes by, they say the phone is under warranty and they would send a FedEx label but need my address, other info, and IMEI again. I send all this info to them the same day, next day they tell me a lable will be issued. Another day passes, the issue the label. Very inefficient, slow process. Sony told me the repairs will take up to 14 business days from the moment they receive it, no loaner would be provided. The phone is out of order for a week and will be for close to a month. Terrible Customer Service from Sony. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I am writing this review after using the phone for two weeks. I switched to Xperia 10 plus from Xperia XZs and Z3 before that. I used to be a fan of the Sony brand with much all my electronics being Sony (2 TVs, a receiver, a radio, a BT speaker, BT headphones, and cellphones). However, recently I am mostly disappointed in the design, features, and quality Sony offers at a premuim price. On the positive side 1. Sony Xperia 10 plus phone seems to have better connection on TMobile than both XZs and Z3 before it. 2. It has a better camera, but still not too good, which always surprised me with Z3 and XZs how crappy Sony phone cameras are, considering that Sony makes phone photo sensors. 3. It FINALLY has a functioning fingerprint reader. 4. The screen image is very good. However, in my opinion, there are several deficiencies that would prevent me from recommending this model. 1. It arrived in an open box. Just like several others have complained. 2. The phone is not loud enough even at Max volume. When I am outside, it is hard to hear the caller. The volume is OK over bluetooth in the car. However, i noticed that during the call the usefull volume adjustment is very limited; it is useful at just the max and a notch below, and anything lower is inaudible. 3. The fingerprint reader is finicky, working most of the times but not always. I added 2 versions of my right thumb prints and it still manages to not recognize. For comparison, my son's Galaxy s10e sensor works always and very quickly. 4. The power button and the fingerprint sensor are separate. On Z3 and XZs power button and fingerprint sensor (although not enabled) were one thing. By force of habit and ergonomically my thumb finds the fingerprint sensor, so I find myself pressing on the sensor when I am trying to lock the phone. This is a poor engineering decision. 5. Long screen is a con for me rather than the pro. I understand it is designed to match movie format, but I do not watch many movies on such small screen, so black bars during the movie were never a concern for me. However, put my phone in my front pocket, and it is uncomfortable to sit down or bend down with this phone in my pocket as its corners dig into my stomach. Additionally, randomly the home screen gets resized to the more mainstream format. In other words, on the home screen I have icons at the bottom of the screen and, a few times, after I unlocked the phone, these icons were pushed two rows up. Furthermore, when mirroring screen to a TV to view pictures (when unable to Cast like with a Samsung TV) the long screen wastes a lot of space at the top and the bottom making the actual image I am trying to see tiny. 6. I had issues with the screen rotation. Even though rotation was turned on, the screen would get stuck in either a portrait or landscape and a reboot would be requred to fix. I tested accelerometer per instructions on Sony website and it tested OK. I wonder if this is another quirk of the long screen. 7. Cameras on the back protrude out of the body of the phone and give this thin phone extra thickness, but more importantly without a case they are susceptible to damage when the phone is laid down on a desk, because it is either screen down or camera down. 8. Pictures are OK but can't compare to those taken with my wife's iPhone or with my son's Galaxy S10e. I understand that those are higher level models, but if history holds true, in a year we will see S10e clearing for about what this phone costs today. Overall, in my opinion, this phone sells at a premium price, has a form factor which I don't find convenient and has quirks caused by the screen, has power button separate from the fingerprint sensor, and has poor outdoors calls volume, broke within 2 months. I am looking forward to changing to another device and would not recomment these long Sony phones to anyone.",7,"Sony"
"2995","B07MZ2TRTC",5,"false","Overall this is a good quality mid-priced phone. The screen is nice, the fingerprint scanner works well, the build is solid. I have premium phones that take a better picture, but the cameras on this are fine for this price point. The 2x optical zoom is very nice, and by the way that works with video too. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of field -- I shot some video through a window out to the back yard, and you could see the fibers on the window screen two feet away as well as the trees much farther out. Performance specs (RAM, CPU) are plenty good enough for most uses (although gamers can find beefier CPUs), and operations is smooth. The Android experience seems to be relatively standard, other than a folder of Sony apps and their ""side sense"" feature, which I like. The thing that's most different about this phone is how long and skinny it is. It's more pronounced than I had imagined, having used another fairly long smartphone. This one is both narrower and taller than what I am used to, and it changes the way I use the phone. With this phone I find myself wanting to split the screen and have two apps running; fortunately with Android N, and the large RAM, that's a pretty smooth experience. I do wish, though, that I could, for example, give 60% of the screen to YouTube and 40% to Settings, and watch them side by side. That doesn't seem to be possible. So think about your use case. My guess is that the folks who will like this phone the most will be those who find the split-screen feature useful but don't want to pay the currently *insane* prices for a folding phone.",4,"Sony"
"2996","B07MZ2TRTC",5,"false","My daughter kept saying that she was having problems with her cellphone. I couldn't send her pictures because her phone couldn't open them. She wasn't receiving my texts 100% of the time. And she couldn't even check her emails. I wasn't the only one who was having problems reaching her. My mother, her brothers, and others were all getting increasingly frustrated. You can curse the darkness or light a candle. I decided to light a candle. This phone comes unlocked which means that it didn't matter that she had her own plan, different from mine. And this is a great phone. She was a loyal Samsung user but I decided to take a chance on Sony. I figured she would like it well enough. I was not prepared for how enthusiastic she would be. First, the phone was super easy for her to set up. We picked up a screensaver for her because, to be fair, she's pretty hard on her phones. I insisted that she call or text me before she communicated with anyone else. And she did. Second, a day later, she sent me a selfie. She loves the camera. The quality of the pictures is so good, she's been updating her social media more frequently. Third, she was able to add an SD card. Because she takes art commissions based on the pictures she posts on social media, she needs to take a lot of pictures. Having a phone that can be easily upgraded is an essential (and, I confess, I didn't even think about this as an essential feature for her.) Overall, we all hear from her more often--whether it is via text or phone call. She was able to sync up her email with the phone. Her experience has been great and I have no complaints because she is not the type to settle for something that isn't good enough, even if new is better than old. Glad she likes this new phone even more than I had hoped she would.",3,"Sony"
"2997","B07MZ2TRTC",4,"false","When it comes to smartphones, Apple iPhone & Samsung Galaxy dominate the market. However, you still have other brands with their own devices that are still attempting to compete with their own line (Sony, Motorola, LG, etc.). This Sony Xperia 10 Plus is a sleek phone with a lot of great features. The size is HUGE! The screen is true 16:9 ratio, so movies and shows filmed in their format naturally fill up the entire screen with no black bars. It truly is amazing! A downside is the sound speaker. It's very poor quality and actually had cackles and static when playing music and sound effects from games. The battery life is amazing! I use it to play games and as a backup device so I can get a couple of days, depending on how frequently I use it, before charging. If I go out and play Pokemon Go for a community day, it'll last the entire event. When playing games, sometimes there is some lag or choppiness, that I don't typically see on my iPhone X. This is my first Android device, so learning how to use it takes some time. I'm still trying to learn how to take screenshots, turn up my brightness, etc. However I really like some of the differences in regards to multi-tasking and background app features that iPhone doesn't have. There are also two rear cameras which takes great quality portrait style photographs. There are a lot of fun things you can do with the camera also, like AR features and filters. It's a great phone option that works great, has many great features, and doesn't cost nearly as much as the leading brands. A great choice.",3,"Sony"

"3034","B07MZ2TRTC",3,"true","Hello. I purchased this phone for my wife's birthday party. A note about shipping is after my review. I purchased this phone for my wife. Her previous phone was a Microsoft Lumia 950, pushing 3 years of usage. This was a very good upgrade from that phone. The size difference was easily distinguishable and the first thing she noticed. The width is skinnier than the Lumia 950. The screen is also bigger, about an inch longer diagonally. She has small hands and it's perfect for her to grip with one hand and use. She's always used 2 hands for her smart phones so it's still a habit for her to use two hands with this, but I see her using one hand more often than before. Next, after turning on and setting up the phone, the next noticeable thing was the amount of apps available. On the Lumia 950 she had to go through a website or just not participate due to lack of apps in the Windows store, but now that hasn't been an issue. She's been able to download a bunch of apps that have been very useful (for example, the Walmart app allows for Walmart Pay and she used the app to pay for a transaction in-store when she forgot her credit card at home). Last, she loves the camera and massive screen. She casually takes photographs but really enjoys the 21:9 aspect ratio for taking wide photos. She uploads to Instagram to show her family and friends back at her hometown and the quality of the photos that came from the Xperia 10 have been great. For me, I prefer something more mid-range (I have the Honor View 10 which IMO takes better quality photos and runs smoother) so I personally would rate this as ""good enough"" but for her, it greatly surpasses her basic needs and she loves the phone. Quick tip: she set up fingerprint unlock once for her thumb and it would misread her print a great deal, so I had her ""register"" another fingerprint when in actuality she just registered her thumb a second time and now it rarely misreads her fingerprint. Finally, a note about shipping: I preordered the phone on March 13 for my wife's birthday present, it released on March 18, and was marked as shipped on March 20. A week went by with no shipping updates so I called Amazon support and the representative said that it was stuck at the warehouse, so she would send another phone rush delivery and when the original phone arrives to send it back. The second phone arrived on March 28, a few days after my wife's birthday. I received the original phone in mid-April and sent it back. [EDIT] This phone gets one less star due to some apps just not working properly. I installed the McDonald's app and Nike SNKRS app and both won't properly connect, even though mine doesn't have any problems. It could be because her Google account is originally from another country that is now being used in the United States but I don't know. On her phone, the McDonald's app won't show daily deals and she cannot do mobile order, and the SNKRS app just keep saying there's an error when trying to log in.",5,"Sony"

Extremely disappointed!!",8,"Sony"
"3039","B07MZ2TRTC",5,"true","I like the form factor, a long phone, which is ergonomic. Sony's version of Android is extremely cut down and simple. The Xperia 10's speakers are amazing. The speakers are the best that I have ever heard. The sound seems extremely natural and comparable to stand alone speakers. The camera is solid, but it's auto focus on macro shots are questionable at times. The battery life is decent for a puny 2870 mAh battery. I only use the phone for reading, web surfing, and non-intense tasks. I can get by charging it once every two days. After significant battery degradation and wear and tear in the future, I worry that the battery life will be poor. Also, I suspect that I bought an open-box phone because the box appeared to be re-taped. The smartphone's plastic packaging appeared to be opened because a significant amount of dust was inside the plastic packaging. The cables and charging adapter looked brand new. Then again, I paid $295, which was discounted $54 from MSRP, so I understand that Amazon.com had to off-load their other inventory at a discounted rate. I hope Sony's smartphone division can break even or be profitable again because they make solid phones at the mid-range price point. The Xperia 10's bizarre long 21:9 body design is a strong step forward to try new designs to differentiate themselves from the competition. If Sony shuts down its smartphone business, it's going to be a dull world with only Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi dominating with their boring designs.",3,"Sony"

My advice is try it and you might get lucky. If it does not work for you return it in time to get a refund. I went back to my Note 4 and I'm going to wait for the Note 10 to see if it is worth it.

Listened to Youtube and the sound was good. I can't test the phone audio. The screen is a nice 6"" size with nice clarity and color.

"3042","B07MZ2TRTC",4,"false","I've been using the Sony Experia 10 Mobile phone for Android development testing purposes for a couple of weeks. I'm enjoying the non-standard, tall 21:9 display which has very sharp resolution. Although I've not watched much streaming video content, holding the phone in landscape mode provides nice resolution and aspect ratio. The photos I've taken are pleasing and rendered well on the display. I understand from other reviews that the battery life of this phone is substandard but I've been satisfied with the battery life so far compared to other Android phones I've used. I don't play games that might drain the battery quickly so, if you're a gamer, please beware of potentially substandard battery life. The good news is that the phone charged quickly using the included USB cable. I wish the phone supported wireless charging but it does not. The build quality looks good, which is expected of a Sony product. The phone feels comfortable in my hand although it is a little slippery so finding some kind of phone case is probably a good idea. However, due to the non-standard size, you're probably limited to Sony-only cases. I did find training the fingerprint reader to be quite tricky and time consuming. Once trained, however, it's very nice that the display powers up just by using the reader. The audio quality has been satisfactory. While I'm not a power user, this phone has worked well for me and is well-priced for the features and performance it offers.",6,"Sony"

Shame on them, I will never buy anything again from sony.",3,"Sony"
"3045","B07MZ2TRTC",2,"false","It pains me to write this because I consider myself a loyal Sony customer ON THE PLANET (Try me, son!). I have owned the Xperia TL, Z, Z1, Z2, Z5 Premium, XZ Performance and now the Xperia 10 Plus. I only purchased this phone because my XZ Performance broke (fell off my motorcycle and ran over by an SUV). I figured this phone can hold me off until the Xperia 1 comes out which I was so excited about. I have nothing but regret with this phone. I have never regretted buying a Sony product, regardless of the money I have spent (Bravia 65x900F, 65A8f, LSPX-P1 & s1, HT-ST5000, Xperia Z tablets and who knows how many bluetooth speakers, earphones and speakers). If this is not being shafted by Sony I do not know what is. So let's go over the garbage that is the Xperia 10 Plus. First, there is NO camera button. The reason why this is so important is because up to this point the camera button was used to be able to take a picture without having to fully authenticate. Now, you must fully login and find the ""Camera App."" The brains at Sony thought they could mitigate this by added the ""Camera App"" to all main screens. I can't express how much of a FAIL this is. This is embarrassing. Next on the embarrassment list are the speakers. Sony decided that the new 21:9 scale phone is the new direction and I was all on board. When using the phone you realize that the speakers are on the bottom of the phone. Did anyone at Sony hold this phone let alone use it? You CAN'T use a 21:9 ratio aspect phone WITHOUT covering the bottom of the phone, which muffles/completely silences the sound. My hand is now a claw that needs to clamp down on the phone in a way that I do not cover the bottom, let along lean in on anything that will cover the speakers. Again, I challenge ANYONE at Sony to prove to me that you actually used this phone. If you guys have, then God help us you shouldn't be making Phones. Another slap in the face is the fact that the Power button and the fingerprint reader have been decoupled. Any one who has used the previous phones will know that they used to be the same. International versions have the fingerprint reader/power button enabled while the US versions did not (Thank the loser patent trolls for that one). It was great to have them together because I can do two very important this at once. Turn on the phone and authenticate. These were separated with the XZ2 and XZ3 in favor of the Fingerprint reader being in the back. Now they have been moved again moving the fingerprint read below the power button, which gives birth to many of awkward moments powering on the phone then going to authenticate with fingerprint to just say screw it here is my pattern. This is as FAIL as it gets. What gets me the most is that Sony already is stumbling over themselves on how to solve this problem and are coming off as incompetent. Solve the problem and stick to your solution! Why would I follow your lead if you can't even follow your own. I also probably wouldn't be as upset it ANY one of my Sony bluetooth devices (x2 WI-1000X, x2 WF-1000x, LSPX-P1, LSPX-S1, SRS-S3) actually worked as Trusted devices and let me in pre-authenticated. I can go on and on about how bad this phone is. I have about lost faith in Sony, with regards to phones and will most likely still consider the Xperia 1, probably because it seems I am a glutton for punishment. Sony, you guys should be embarrassed by this phone. If you guys were so keen on staying in the game, why would you drop this on to your customers? Blows my mind that you guys would give the people that have made these decisions ANY power to make make key decisions that go against your core values. Sounds like you need to relocate some of your staff to Sony Alaska. To anyone who works hard for their money, stay away from this phone. You will not be the envy of your friends, but rather the butt of their jokes. Sony, get your stuff together! This is unacceptable. Other issues with the phone: - Headphone jack broke already - Camera has green and red burst; most likely a damaged lens",3,"Sony"
"3046","B07MZ2TRTC",5,"false","First of all, people just giving a review on the fact that a used phone was shipped shouldn't be taken into consideration of the phone rating, but the seller should be the one effected. That said on to the talk of the xperia10. First off this is not, I repeat NOT a flagship phone. That being said you will have a lower quality screen resolution(hd+), ram size unless you get the Chinese release with 6gb, chipset, and Camera quality. Note also that the last 4 phones I have had were all flagships with 4k screens (lg/Samsung). The screen on xperia 10 is fantastic looking with its ability to showcase 21:9 video and pictures. Even though there is no 4k support, I'm pleased with what the screen shows. The battery is not all that impressive only being 3000mah but it does just fine getting you through a day of even above average use including video. The chipset is the same as last year model xa2, but can still run all current games, but with lowered quality. Most games however do not support 21:9 ratios. The camera can get the job done, but has a challenge in low light with a large presence of noise in the photos. Recording can be done with the 21:9 ratio and looks relatively good. It has a headphone jack which is a cool win in my book. Has one exterior bottom speaker that is a just ok like every other phone including flagships. But as a first Sony phone, I can easily say that I'm in full support and will recommend this phone to anyone wondering about it. Yes the phones can be over priced as Sony typically does that, but it's really not hard to find it at a good price (even the xperia 1) if you just do a little digging and are patient to find the right deal.",1,"Sony"

"3053","B07MZ2TRTC",4,"false","Let me preface this review by stating that I currently own an iPhone XR. When I was offered the opportunity to review the Xperia I thought it would be a fun experience, but that I would never consider switching from iOS. I came away so impressed with Android and the Xperia that I seriously considered switching, but I am too entrenched in the Apple ecosystem to make the move at this point. The Xperia is a very nicely made phone and is constructed using high quality materials. The front is all glass, while the back is a warp-around metal shell. The phone has nice weight to it and feels substantial, but not heavy. Size-wise it is the same thickness as the iPhone XR and a bit taller and narrower. The Xperia does not flex when handled. Despite being priced several hundred dollars less than my iPhone XR the Sony feels every bit as well constructed, even if the materials used aren't quite as nice. The Sony has the power/lock switch on the right side about 1/3 down from the top. Below that is the fingerprint scanner, and below that is the volume rocker. On the bottom is the USB-C charging port (no wireless charging is supported) and stereo speakers. On the left hand side of the phone is the port for the SIM and Micro-SD cards. The rear of the phone has the dual cameras and LED flash. The only issues I had are that it's easy to cover the speakers when watching videos and the buttons for power and volume are barely raised and difficult to press. With that said, I love the position of the fingerprint scanner. It's a natural place for it to be as my thumb automatically touches it as I pick up the phone. The scanner was very responsive and I never had to wait on it. Speaking of not waiting on things, I found the Sony to be very responsive in use. It rarely left me hanging whether I was opening apps, playing games, surfing the web, or taking photos. The processor and RAM are more than sufficient for most users, unless you are heavy into processor intensive games. I will note that the iPhone XR felt a bit faster than the Sony, however. Also, OK Google is not as responsive as Siri. The Sony's screen is large, bright, and colorful. The resolution is great and the screen is sharp and clear. I did notice at times that the colors could be unnaturally oversaturated, however, and the auto-brightness adjustment sometimes takes a few seconds to adjust. The screen is very responsive to touch, and typing, scrolling, and zooming operate smoothly. The extra-wide aspect ratio allows some videos to completely fill the screen without letterboxing, but some content will have bars on the left/right sides, so it's a mixed bag. The 13 Megapixel rear camera is an excellent. One thing to know is that the second 5 Megapixel camera isn't used to take photos. It's used for the Bokeh purposes (blurring the background behind subjects) to assist in distance mapping. The main camera offers a lot of control over settings and filters and takes high quality photos. Photos in bright light are detailed and sharp, while low light photos have good color and brightness. The flash is very bright. The camera has a built-in image stabilizer for sharper photos in low light. The Bokeh effect works well when it functions properly4, but sometimes the camera can struggle identifying a subject. Videos are recorded at a maximum resolution of 4K, but the phone pops up a message that states that it can overheat taking 4K video. Videos are sharp and clear with good sound recording. Battery life is more than capable. The phone lasts me about 2 days before I feel the need to charge it again. I use my phone moderately throughout the day to text, check e-mail, surf the web, stream music, watch a couple of short YouTube videos, and play the occasional game for about a half hour. I leave the screen at about half brightness and have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on at all times. All in all... an impressive Android phone that is well designed, nicely made, and performs well.",30,"Sony"

These recently released phones are still great but the only category I could fit this into would be someone who needs a basic smartphone and have difficulty with small screen sized phones or those who mainly play games and watch movies. However, if the specs on the Xperia 1 are true then I will definitely be purchasing it. All this phone needs to have is at least the specs of the Sony Xperia XZ3 or Galaxy S10.

"3060","B07MZ2TRTC",4,"false","Testing this as a free product from the Amazon Vine program. I actually use an iPhone, so it was pleasant to come back to Android to see some of the things I miss. This phone is unlocked with dual Sim availability, apparently works with most major carriers, I had no problem with a prepaid SIM from AT&T for $35 (cancel anytime) with 1GB of data which I used to test it out. At just over $400, that’s less than half the price of an iPhone XS The Xperia 10 Plus has a super long screen, or CinemaWide as Sony refers to the 21:9 panel. Although it looks fairly incongruous, it’s fairly easy to handle as it is quite thin and relatively narrow. However you do require a lot of thumb stretching on this Plus model. The screen is oddly not beveled, maybe Sony are trying to buck a trend or be “new” but it feels a little square and awkward in the hand. The screen itself is fabulous as like the flagship Xperia 1 it boasts IPS LCD with 1080p+ resolution (1,080 x 2,520px). There are dual cameras on the back with a 12MP main module (1/2.8” sensor) and an 8MP telephoto camera (2x zoom, only does photos). The phone can record 4K videos (in 16:9 and 21:9 formats) and features SteadyShot (electronic stabilization). The 8MP selfie camera is identical to the one on the Xperia 1. The Snapdragon 636 chipset offers a performance upgrade over the old XA2 phones as it features four Cortex-A73 based cores in addition to the A53 cores. The phone has 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, plus a microSD slot for up to 512GB more (are you listening Apple!) The OS is stock, with some features from Sony including Side sense with the App Pair that automatically launches two apps in a pre-defined top-bottom split-screen view. Early impression is that this is a cool phone, but I will have to play with it some more. 4 stars.",14,"Sony"
"3061","B07MZ2TRTC",3,"false","As someone who had been a loyal Sony customer, it's hard for me when the first word that came to my mind, as I write this review, is 'disappointed'. And that word summarizes how I feel about the Sony Xpedia 10 Plus. And the feature that I dislike the most about this phone, is that it has an embedded, rechargeable battery that can only be replaced by an authorized Sony repair center. So, I won't going to give away my current phone, because the day this one needs a new battery, and gets shipped to a 'Sony repair center', I would need a backup phone, or will be left without a phone. As simple as that. I'm sorry if this sounds like a rant, but just think about it. Sending my phone to a 'Sony repair center', means sending a device which contains my most private and sensitive information to unknown people. And the only way to prevent the data from exposure, it's to wipe it clean before shipping the device. Well, I still would need another phone until this one gets returned. And there is the waste of time setting up this phone again. Not to mention the fee paid to the 'Sony repair center'. My frustration with this issue comes from the fact that in the last ten years, every phone I've ever owned allows me to order a second battery, which I could replace myself, and even carry as a possible backup. Please don't get me wrong, I like some features in this phone, but I'm disappointed at its obvious flaws. What were the people who designed it, thinking? Or rather, not thinking. Seriously, the so called 'SIM card tray' is the flimsy thing ever related to any phone. It's so fragile that they shouldn't had bothered including it. Well, the SIM card tray holds the nano SIM card, and works as a cover for the micro memory card slot too. I suggest placing the phone down, with the rear camera facing you, before carefully removing the SIM card tray. Because the nano SIM card goes on that side of the tray. Also, related to this SIM card tray, you should know that there is essential information under it. Usually, the IMEI number information for a phone is under its battery, but since in this case, the Xperia comes completely sealed, they had to find another place to store the IMEI number information. Well, it's under the SIM card tray, one must use a fingernail to pull out two tiny thin pieces of plastic with said information. Or dial *#06# into the phone to get the IMEI number. Using either method, just make sure to save such information in another location, in case the phone get lost, or stolen. It's necessary to report it as such. So, is there anything I like about the Xperia 10 Plus? Sure, there are plenty of things, like the fact that is 5Ghz Wi-Fi capable, so the streaming of videos and gaming are better. And of course, the 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi is also supported. And the Sony Xpedia 10 Plus, can be used with only Wi-Fi, no nano SIM card needed for using this phone if one doesn't want to. I tried my AT&T SIM with it, and it was a plug and play, I didn't even have to register with AT&T. Besides that, I like that it comes with Android 9 Pie running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, which makes it a very fast Smartphone. And it has a wide high quality and clear display. It also uses mostly Android apps, and the Sony apps included are not bothersome. One can use them, or disable them without problems. Both cameras are good, and the USB-C type connector for charging and data transfer, is a great feature. A charging cable with a USB-C type connector on one end, and a USB A connector on the other end, it's supplied, together with a wall-charger to use with it. And this phone is heavier than any other I've ever had, it's more like a Tablet than a Smartphone, so I'm probably be using it as such. Yes, most Tablets are really twice as large as the Sony Xpedia 10 Plus, but in the practice, I just realized that this phone is better for watching videos, reading and gaming, than my current Android phone.",14,"Sony"
"3062","B07MZ2TRTC",3,"false","Update 2019-08-13: Touch screen unresponsiveness became so frustrating that I sat down to reset the phone by erasing everything from the phone. I first removed the SD card which is next to SIM card and I had to remove SIM card first. When I reinserted SIM, phone rebooted and I noticed that the touch screen was functioning normally. I was very happy that removal of SD card solved the problem, but that happiness lasted less than one day. Even though the problem now comes less often, it is very annoying nonetheless. It happens when Amber Alert is blaring or when a reminder goes off or when the phone is ringing. Embarrassing when I am at work, meeting, or a public place. I will keep this phone for now and look for black Friday deals to replace this phone. Definitely not worth the hassle. Update 2019-07-19: After having used this device for several months, I am so annoyed that I really dislike this phone. 1) Main problem now is that the touch screen suddenly decides to not react to touch commands. It could happen any time. But, I hate it when it happens when an alarm or reminder comes up or when I am getting a call. Only way to overcome the problem then is to turn off the screen and turn it back again. 2) Finger print sensor doesn't always work reliably. Even when I have clean and dry finger. This problem is not as annoying and I can tolerate this. 3) Keyboard typing is not accurate. I think the problem is due to the phone size. I have reduced star rating. I would not recommend this device to anybody. Original Review: We got the phone in 10 Plus style (6.5"" screen) in black color. Specifications on this phone are very good, but 21:9 size is inconvenient for use. I don't think it is easy to get used to - my wife is still annoyed with the form factor after a couple of weeks of usage. We are using the phone with T-Mobile service and it works well. I removed the SIM card from the current phone to this phone and it worked quite well. Google facilitates data transfer from old phone to the new phone with minimal effort. I have not used a microSD card because 64GB space is more than sufficient for now. Phone comes with Android Version 9 (Pie). Every time there's a major version upgrade, user interface is changed in many areas. That brings new annoyances due to unfamiliar interface and learning curve. Phone function: Connection, sound, and microphone work as expected and no problems observed. Screen: Picture quality, resolution, clarity, colors, etc. are excellent. 21:9 aspect ratio allows for less scrolling, but not worth due to the size inconvenience attached to it. If you are into watching extra wide screen movies on your phone, then you will really enjoy this aspect ratio. Finger print sensor: Unlike most phones, the sensor is on the side. This phone is quite thin, so you can imaging how narrow this sensor could be. It works very well, but not always. When it doesn't work, it complains again and again, and then quits saying ""too many failed attempts."" You have to unlock using the PIN at this point. Camera: 2X optical zoom is a great functionality. You can use volume controls to zoom in and out at incremental values without having to pinch on the screen. Photos come out quite good, but other phones can take equal or better photos. Built-in bokeh effect works very well and the background is blurred to make the subject look better. Battery is not replaceable by customer. USB-C is used for charging. Overall I think it is a good device, with the exception of handling inconvenience due to the form factor. I have loaded some photos so you can compare the phone size relative to $20 bill and Motorola Moto G Plus.",12,"Sony"
"3063","B07MZ2TRTC",4,"false","Although I'm quite pleased with my LG K8, a humble device that costs 1/4 as much as this Sony, I was curious to try out the latest version of Android (9 Pie) on a true high-definition screen with three times as many pixels. Held vertically, both phones are about 2 3/4"" across, a comfortable width for any pocket. But at 6 1/2"", the Sony is a full inch taller, enough to overfill most of the pockets in the pants I wear, and too big to cram into the pockets of my favorite jackets. If you normally carry your phone in a purse or briefcase, the extra length probably won't matter. Sony's marketing touts the 21:9 display of the Xperia 10 Plus as ideal for viewing video ""in the same aspect ratio your favorite movies are recorded in"" (quoting their Web site). This may be true if your favorite movies were recorded (or photographed) in the ultrawide format popularized by CinemaScope in the 1950s, and still employed by many theatrical features released annually. But a substantial number of theatrical movies, and nearly all programs produced for home broadcast or Web streaming, are intended for display on a standard HD TV/monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio. Viewed on this device, these videos are ""pillarboxed,"" centered on the screen with substantial black margins on either side of the image. 33% of the available pixels go unused. The dual-lens rear camera lets you shoot movies in 21:9 format, which look very dramatic when played on a screen with a similar aspect ratio. Happily, movies aren't the only use for those extra pixels. Held vertically, the Sony lets you see substantially more of a scrolling Web site or Kindle page than a standard phone. A handy feature lets you split the screen, showing one app on the top half and another below. I'm happy to report that the Xperia sports a standard 1/8"" stereo headphone jack as well as Bluetooth 5 with aptX for wireless audio transmission. Sony claims that the audio chip directly supports HD audio (LPCM, FLAC, ALAC and DSD) with up to 24-bit 192kHz resolution, and can play almost any audio file you can throw at it, including Vorbis, Opus and even MIDI. (Maximum DSD resolution is not specified; probably DSD64). I plugged in my Sennheiser 650s and played a couple of especially fine 24/192 HD tracks (James Taylor's ""Mud Slide Slim,"" the Dunedin Consort's ""Mass in B Minor"" by Bach). They sounded pretty darned good. Audiophiles who want to avoid the bother and expense of an external DAC should take notice. UI responsiveness is very good, thanks to a decent Qualcomm 636 processor and 4 GB of RAM. The 64GB of built-in storage can be augmented by a micro SD card with up to 512 GB capacity, enough to hold a VERY large collection of lossless audio files and HD movies. A pity that the 3000 mA battery is not user-replaceable. There oughta be a law. Ergonomically, the phone is easy to hold, at least vertically. The power button, fingerprint sensor and volume controls are placed for convenient access, if you're right-handed. This phone is a good choice for cinephiles into widescreen epics, music lovers into HD audio, and workaholic multitaskers. But Is the increased width of the Xperia's screen worth the awkwardness of its form factor? Only you can decide.",8,"Sony"
"3064","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"false","I love the camera on this phone. The screen is huge, the 4k colors are vibrant, and the processor is fast and efficient. I think the thing I have enjoyed the most is that in the month I have owned it, it has never crashed or had any bugs. This is a rarity in my experience with Android phones. My critique would be the finger print scanner. It's located on the right side of the phone and you use your thumb to unlock it. It works about half the time. The problem seems to be that phone cases get in the way, blocking the access partially. I have bought and tried two cases and both had the same issue. This is a big miss in my opinion.",1,"Sony"
"3065","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"false","I've been an Xperia user for several years and I have to say that Sony has come a long way! No ugly notches. No big chins either. No pesky rounded screen edges. This phone was thoughtfully designed with the consumer in mind. Yes, they got rid of the headphone jack. But that's the way things go. Anyway, I am very much delighted with this phone. The Xperia 5 just came out, but I opted to get this instead. Can't beat the bigger and 4K OLED screen! This is bigger than my XZ3, but it feels a lot lighter and easier to hold.",1,"Sony"

"3067","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"false","I love my new phone. I've been dying to do a review for a while, but it's got so many layers it's tough to summarize all the pros and cons. Let me start out by saying that I am not a technical expert on cell phones, I'm just a user. This phone is the best phone I've ever got to use for pictures and videos. It Bosts a 21:9 cinema display. You can tell when you watch videos on this device. Excellent for streaming. The ratio is great for those that like film making. I've read reviews where plenty of people have recommended the Experia1 for film making due to the high quality and potability of the device. I took my phone on vacation with us recently and I love the pics that I took. The Experia1 easily replaces my iPhone 7 plus. The world's first 21:9 CinemaWide™ 4K HDR OLED display and a pro-quality triple lens camera. Need I say more. The Eye FA mode is one of Sony's advanced features found in its cameras. I don't know the technical information on it, I just know that it makes for excellent pictures. The sound quality is also exceptional. I haven't had an issue yet while making a call. The Experia1 is also a good size. Fits nicely in my hand. It's just as long as my iPhone 7 plus, but less wider. I imagine that is so to achieve the 21:9 ratio. This is a good Segway now to go over the cons. * In some movies, I get a dark play back. While watching the same movie in my iPhone, the picture was brighter. * The touch screen is sometimes too sensitive. I end up bringing up a feature that I don't want to use. * it has finger print detection, but I haven't found a good case that would allow me to use that feature. More pros... * You can shrink windows for multi tasking. * It gives you quick access to the last apps that you have used. * Comes with awesome movie making and picture taking aps. * Easy access to recent news and events. * It has a built-in game mode enhancer. Overall, I recommend the Experia1. It's quickly replacing my iPhone.",1,"Sony"

"3070","B07PHQ7FBP",4,"false","Hi there, So I will be reviewing this Phone and I am very excited to do so. I am a LOYAL iPhone user and I've never ever tried anything else before. I've been using iPhone 6 s plus for 4 years now and I just felt like I needed to try something new. I really care about Picture Quality and Video quality, and iPhone had never disappointed me when it came to taking pictures ( When the lightning was right) So lets go ahead and review this Phone ( Quick Disclaimer this will be my first impression review because I don't have this phone for that long but I will update my review after a couple of weeks) DESIGN WOW. This Phone looks so Tall and unique, I don't think that I've ever seen a phone before with a 16:9 Ratio. Even tho it is so tall it fits comfortably in my hands and I don't feel like I am overwhelmed by its size. It's pure Black, very slim, light and super elegant with a glossy finish both sides. It has 3 bottoms only on the right side and 1 Fingerprint scanner which is on the Right side too (Impressive) From Top to Bottom: + -, Fingerprint scanner, On-Off Bottom, and an extra Camera- Buttom to take Pictures. On the backside, you will find 3 Cameras 26 mm, 52 mm, 16mm. I tested a couple of things compared to my iPhone 6s Plus and I need to admit that Sony Xperia is not that Bad. Sound quality - iPhone More Bass, Sony Xperia Louder Sharper Sound video quality ( Watching Youtube OR Movie Trailer) Both Great but Sony Xperia is better for one because of the Screen length and for two the loud sound quality and for 3 it has a Dynamic Sound Vibration which makes it even better. CAMERA one of the most important things to me, I haven't tried the camera in different lighting but from my first impression, I feel like it did a pretty good job! I uploaded a picture for you to see both Pictures Quality in the same lightning, I feel like you get more color out of the Picture with the Sony Xperia. I also took. a picture from my Window and its pretty sharp. One great fact is that it automatically takes pictures JUST BEFORE you press the shutter key at the right moment. And you can save the ones you like the best. The Camera as 1644 pixel by 8840. So it says that it shoots 4K videos but I haven't tried that yet. The front camera is not the BEST but I feel like a lot of font cameras are not really the BEST BEST BEST. But dont get me wrong it's still good! COOL FACTS ABOUT THIS PHONE - Water Resistance - Quick Rinse, etc. - Split Screen App use two apps at the Same Time - Made out of Gorilla Glass - Battery last longer! Charged it only once in 1-2 Days - 6.5 INCH Screen - COOL APPS Pre-installed like Movie Editor, 3D Scan scan your face or other objects, Cinema Pro, Netflix, Fortnite, PS App, Movie Creator, Games. - Side Sensor CONCLUSION I really like this Phone, I never thought that I would ever take a look at Andriod, etc, But this Phone is really good and I feel like I can take Great Pictures with it. YES, it is expensive, I wouldn't price it that High but it has a lot of features that are good to use. Phone Design is very luxurious looking and screen quality is very Sharp and Clean. The camera has 12 MP and a Wide Ankle. It's a great phone! Why not try something New? 8.9 Stars from 10",14,"Sony"
"3071","B07PHQ7FBP",2,"false","say what you want, Sony makes the best Android phones on the market. I'm currently using the XZ2 Premium, and I absolutely love the camera on that phone, and aside from the weight of the XZ2P, thickness, all is good. So, when I found out the Xperia 1 was coming out to replace the XZ2P, I was really excited, and got it today. I couldn't be more disappointed. The screen display quality is absolutely unmatched, but the form factor is just not working. The screen in length is too long in ratio, in comparison to the width. and the width is so narrow that if you rotated the screen, the keyboard takes up almost the entire screen, making it not useable at all. The width is also at a point, in between full grip, or one-hand grip, making it something to get use to. I've never felt this on any of Sony's past flagship, except this one, strange. The side sense is also not working well, I can't control when it wants to work, and so I don't even try to make it come up anymore. I'm not sure the three lens camera is better in picture taking than the XZ2P, as that is the best low-light camera on a smartphone yet. Even though Sony went 3 lens, wide, med, and tele, I still prefer the XZ2P and the higher mega pixel count + stunning picture taking capability. The camera on the XZ2P is noticeably better than on the XZ Premium. The fingerprint sensor is just not working intuitively anymore, once you're used to the XZ2P on the back. I know a lot of reviewers nitpicked that location, but I do believe it's the better location in comparison. The main reason I gave this a 2 star, is because of one major flaw. Remember when Apple had the problems with the Iphone 4 with the antenna strips embedded into the side edge of the phone, both bluetooth, cell, gps, etc.... well, starting with the XZ2 generation, and the major complaint I have of the XZ2P, and also the reason buying the Xperia 1 is so I can get better reception. But the Xperia 1 is as bad as the XZ2 series, if not worse, and that is unforgivable in 2019 pushing 5G. A primary function of a phone is to be able to make calls, and this may also be a problem with carriers not having decent coverage, but being in the middle of Southern California having this problem in 2019 is just plain sad. But the XZ2 series and the Xperia 1 has weak antenna strength in comparison to the XZ Premium generation, by a noticeable margin. And this isn't just cell reception, it's wifi, and gps as well. Bluetooth I haven't noticed much, but I bet it's probably not as strong either. Sony needs to go back to their original way of doing antennas, PLEASE. I'm not buying anymore $1000 Sony phones until they fix this problem. I understand we want phones to look nice, but not at the expense of signal strength performance....... enough said. Xperia 1 is going back to Sony. I'm not spending $1000 to have bad signal strength.",8,"Sony"
"3072","B07PHQ7FBP",3,"false","Unboxing: The unboxing is straightforward; just opening the box the phone is presented to you, underneath which are some documents, a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack as well as some headphones. You'll likely want a separate case. There is also an 18 watt charger with a short USB-C to USB-C cable. There is a sticker on the phone advertising the side sense function which is where you tap the phone twice on the little side bezel for one handed mode. Setup: This phone is really quick to set up, requiring only your google account to be fully usable. Coming from iOS, it does take time to get used to the operating system, and after a week it is easy to use like any other smartphone. Design: The phone is built solidly. It won’t flex at all during normal use or bend testing. Both the front and back are covered in Gorilla glass 6, although despite this, it is possible to scratch it so I’d recommend a screen protector and case/skin. The camera hump on the back houses three 12 MP cameras, one normal, wide angle, and one telephoto. It isn’t flush with the back so the phone will rise a little on a flat surface. The somewhat small and dim flashlight is placed above the camera module. Also on the back is the NFC making it easy to connect to NFC enabled devices. There is a slight bit of branding on the back in dark grey text saying Sony and lower down the phone ‘XPERIA’. At the top of the phone there is SIM card tray which also has a micro SD card slot and does not require a sim tray tool to open. At the bottom there is a USB-C charging port as well as a mediocre speaker to the right. There is a total of 3 buttons and a fingerprint sensor all on the right side. It would’ve been nice to have the volume rocker on the left side to declutter the right. One of the three buttons is a shutter button, which like real DSLR cameras has a little half press focus button which is pretty neat and useful. There is a problem with a side mounted fingerprint sensor: you can use it easily only while holding the phone in your hand. At this price point I think that Sony should’ve put an in display finger print reader but I guess I’d be wishing at this point. The reader works well as long as your finger is in the right position, and at its quickest it matches Face ID in unlock speed. The earpiece at the top is recessed compared to the screen so stuff can be trapped inside; if you have tweezers you can clean it out but be careful. It would’ve been nice to have a little mesh grate covering it to lower the chances of stuff getting inside of the earpiece. There is a small forehead and chin bezel with a very small side bezel running the whole 6.5 inches of the phone. Inside the top bezel on the left side there is a little status LED which is on for charging and can be customized as to when or if you want it to light up. The phone is actually massive, length wise, easily beating an XS max with a case on. Width wise its shorter allowing for the 21:9 screen ratio perfect for watching movies. Something worth noting is that the phone is water resistant to IP65/68. The phone comes in 4 colors: black, purple, grey, and white. Personally, for a little more color I’d go for purple, but black has a very attractive stealthy appearance. Usability: This phone uses the newest snapdragon processor, the 855 which runs in tandem with Sony’s own gpu, a scaled down X1 chip, the same used in their OLED TV line up such as the A1E. It runs android 9 pie and is relatively free of bloatware, ignoring Sony’s ‘cinema pro’ and ‘movie creator’. Despite the power, the battery runs all day long and I still have 30% battery after a full day of use. Multitasking is actually somewhat useful and makes me wish I had it on my iPhone. It has one app over the other, although a lot of my apps don’t seem to support this feature, but the ones that do work perfectly. The previously mentioned micro SD card slot supports an extra 512 gb of expansion, plus the included 128gb of storage making this phone perfect for storing high quality photos and a ton of music and apps. Screen: The screen is probably the biggest reason as to why you’d buy this phone, and it does not disappoint. It is a glossy 21:9 6.5inch 4k HDR OLED screen which has 100% of the P3 color range with 10 bit color. This is the best screen I’ve ever seen on a phone and is the best thing about it. The screen is about 655 nits, compared to the 725 nits of the Xs max. This is currently the best phone screen period. Camera: The front facing camera at just 8MP isn’t great and lacks detail. In well lit situations it works okay but in dark forget about it. The back cameras are better but are not without their faults. The main shooter on the back is okay but the brightness is very dark, and once again the details are hard to make out when compared to the iPhone XS Max. The wide-angle lens is probably the most useful out of the three and is something again I wish I had on my iPhone. It is very clear and allows for easier to take group photos. The telephoto lens also suffers from the same quality and detail loss as the main shooter. When zoomed all the way (10x) quality goes out of the window and is simply just a zoom with little detail. Honestly for a $1000 phone from Sony, a brand known for their cameras among other things, I would expect much better cameras for this price point. Problems- The cameras were certainly a disappointment, but so was the sound. The speakers are muffled and tiny, and just don’t reach the volume that you would expect. Don’t let the Dolby Atmos certification fool you here, this is still a phone. And when compared to my iPhone, the difference is very noticeable and should not be a reason to purchase this phone. The bluetooth is only 4.2 as opposed to 5 which has been out for a while now and the range for whatever reason is incredibly small. Overall, this phone feels like a concept, a great idea but with some poorly executed features. If you really need a 4k screen on your phone I guess go on and get it, but there are just too many flaws, especially in a phone of this price range. If you want android I’d recommend getting a Samsung Galaxy s10+ but if not, get an iPhone XS Max as it just has a better OS and more features.",5,"Sony"
"3073","B07PHQ7FBP",4,"false","As a Apple fangirl (IPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac) I honestly thought no android could change my mind, however the Sony Experia 1 has made me question everything. My previous android experience came from 4 years ago with the galaxy s8 active and note and I had so many issues with glitchy technology I swore them away for good, or so I thought. -The 21:9 aspect ratio does take some time to adjust to, it’s very funny to look at however it’s very comfortable to hold. The 4K HDR OLED display is absolutely breathtaking and I prefer it to the display on my IPhone X. The long screen also allows for multitasking 2 apps (one on top, one on bottom) and it feels natural and doesn’t feel like you sacrifice much to use it comfortably. - Rear facing cameras take great quality photos, however the front facing camera could have so improvements. It does have several fun filters included in the stock camera app that are cute and work great. - All buttons are located on the right side (including volume rocker, fingerprint sensor, power button and dedicated camera button) they are all easily reached with your right thumb when holding however it may be an issue with anyone who holds the phone with their left hand. - Side Sense technology (where you double tap the side of the screen to open a favorites menu) doesn’t seem to work when you want it to but you always activate it on accident. - Fingerprint sensor works excellent without any issue. The Main Cons - NO wireless charging, I definitely feel like all flagship smartphones need wireless charging at this point and the fact that we don’t have it on the Experia 1 is a major disappointment. - SO SLIPPERY, I know pretty much all phones are made of glass now and they are inevitably going to be slippery but Sony takes it to a completely other level, using this phone without a case just seems like an accident waiting to happen. It slides on every surface and has fallen off my couch many times (but has held up great). -Expect issues if using Verizon. I consider myself great with technology but after being unable to receive texts from anyone (and googling every possible fix with no help) I was forced to call customer support. After about 30-45 minutes and speaking with a tier 2 technician they were able to fix the problem, but this was a major headache that probably would have caused me to return the phone had I purchased it. Sony or Verizon or whoever the issue was caused by definitely need to address this issue immediately (I read another review where an individual had the same issue and it wasn’t fixed.)",3,"Sony"

"3081","B07PHQ7FBP",4,"false","Pros:__________ • You’re buying this phone for the display. The 21:9 display dominates everything about this phone. With a 4k viewing, it’s the best cinema movie screen I’ve ever seen, in phone size. 21:9 is what you usually see in the movies. Under this display layout, the widescreen appearance is applied to the movies you’re watching on this phone. You won’t get any black bars on the top or bottom of the display (because of the 21:9 layout) as you’ll only get a full 4k image. No other phone does this and it’s the reason you’ll buy this one. • One other feature of the display is that gaming on this phone is really fun. The screen aspect ratio, and the Snapdragon 855 chip, makes gaming quite an experience. The screen is so large that your thumbs never get in the way of playing. • The design is very premium. All gorilla glass, front and back, while providing a narrow design. It’s not bulky or heavy, has curved metal edges, and overall a unique design from the rest of the smartphone crowd. • System-wise, the phone is fast and efficient like any other smartphone. Quick Bluetooth connectivity, fast internet connection, and the expected performance for the average daily user. • The button layout is perfect for those who are right-handed as the fingerprint scanner is on the side that provides convenient access to my thumb. • Because of the tall display, I found it efficient to be able to split the screen into two separate apps. This is the first phone that actually works well with this feature. • There are a couple of short cuts to be able to use this phone one-handed. The best one I think is, with the large display, just double tapping the home buttons will shrink the whole interface down so your thumb can reach anything that it couldn’t originally reach. This features a small perk, but it’s well made. • One juicy gift is Sony’s Cinema Pro app. This is a real beauty because it gives complete control on how you want to film with the camera. Color settings, stabilization, manual focus frames, brightness, saturation, and so on. This is such a cool app because you can modify the look of what you’ve filmed all on the phone. Filmmakers are going to love this if they’re on the go and need to do some color correcting. • Another awesome feature is Sony’s Creator Mode. When turning this feature on and watching “Stranger Things” with the Netflix app, the colors became much more accurate and vibrant than my past experience with the iPhone X. Note that this mode is softer on the eyes and displays less artificial tones. Honestly any movie you’re watching on this, you need to turn this on. • The camera system has great eye-tracking autofocus. When you get a group photo, you can see a little green box on the screen to let you know which person is focused. It works great and is very helpful for those who need to know if everyone is in focus. • Launching the camera is super quick as you have a button on the side for it. You just press and photo is taken. Quick and the photos are reliable. • Filming on this gives you a lot of options. You can record 21:9 content, to get that movie feel, alter key settings like white balance, resolution, shutter speed, color filter, etc. Overall, this is a phone with a hell of filming experience. • It does alright taking night photos for a phone that doesn’t have a dedicated night mode feature. It takes a little more time to shoot a pic, but that just means that the camera is gathering all the light it can before presenting your shot. Shooting on the sidewalk at 11 at night does give you solid results. • The charging on this phone is quick. Plugging it in, from 0 to 60%, took around 36 minutes. The system has a feature called Adaptive Charging where the phone regulates the charging speed if you leave your phone plugged in overnight. One of the killers in batteries is overcharging and this feature ensures that it won’t happen. Sony thinks ahead of longer-term battery health so my hats off to them. • The speakers are extremely loud and have great directional separation. • Water resistance. I didn’t test this one, but Sony states it. You might have to look at some videos to confirm if this is true. Cons and Oks:__________ • The Camera app is horrible. It’s slow to launch, to take shots and you have to swipe through the end of the app in order to switch from rear to front camera. It’s laborious, not user-friendly, and ruins the point of getting a casual capture as you have to dig around the app in order to take the picture that you want. Yes, you have a quick camera button on the side, but taking a shot really depends where you’re at, the number of peoples, the time, etc. You need to make sure the setting you want will fit the picture you’re taking. The app provides this but it’s poorly laid out. • The camera is decent but not as near as good in what you expect. In dull lighting, the images look flat and on clear sunny days, they looked a little washout. I do wish that the telephoto provided a little more zoom, and the wide angle lens is way too wide. It makes the picture look unnaturally stretched, like a fish-eye lens. • The selfie camera sucks. Without modifying it, it applies some of the most significant beauty filters I’ve seen in a camera. • There is no night mode. It does an alright job without this feature, but it’s not nearly as good in what you want a night picture to be. • No wireless charging. With a price this high, you expect this feature to be common sense. • No headphone jack. This is a movie phone and no headphone jack reduces the experience. You get a USB-C adapter that attaches to the phone’s charging port, but that’s one more thing to carry. • The speakers are loud but 80% of the clarity comes at the bottom speaker. In landscape mode, it’s easy to cover this speaker with your hand. Not the best in the arrangement. • The screen is too dim. Forget watching movies outside as even in max brightness it becomes a challenge to see what you’re watching, or filming. Another issue is when you’re using the camera, because of the screen’s low brightness, videos can be overexposed and you won’t be able to notice it. I found this out when transferring my shots to my computer and saw the significant brightness of my shots that my phone screen didn’t display enough. • Because of the design of this phone, it never sits in my front jeans properly and the narrow design always makes me feel that it can bend at any moment. It feels sturdy but, with a thin body, I assume bending this phone will be easy. • Not a great phone if you’re left handed as all the buttons (volume, fingerprint sensor, separate power button, and the camera button) are on the right side of the phone. • Kind of annoying that the fingerprint sensor and power button are not combined. You now have this extra button that adds a little more nuisance into the experience. • The nuisance grows even more when the fingerprint sensor isn’t even reliable. I had a lot of issues trying to get the sensor to recognize my fingerprint. Multiple times I’ve gotten the “Too many attempts” error to the point that I had to use my pin. The scanner isn’t reliable. • On the filming side you can’t use the flash to brighten your shot, the image stabilization needs to more effective, and there is no built-in editing software. This is a con because the whole point of this phone if the play movies and customize your viewing experience. If this is targeting filmmakers you expect this phone to come with some form of editing software. • Sony’s Side Sense feature is frustrating. I can never get this feature to work and when I don’t try it pops up. Software issues need to be made here. • Another annoying feature is having the phone vibrate in sync with the sound. This Dynamic Vibration vibrates with the music games you play. It does do well when you get a notification or a call, but watching a film isn’t a need for this. It takes you out of the moment if you’re watching something and suddenly vibrations come from your phone. Disable this feature. • The battery life is not great. With a 4k display, you’re going to sacrifice a decent amount of battery life. Around 8 hours of life, this includes watching a 90-minute video. You’ll get through the day with it but will have to charge it every day. • Only one SIM Slot • There is very little grip on this phone. Because of all-around glass design, it makes everything slippery. Simple vibrations on the phone will move the phone thanks to its smooth surface. Never place this on any edge without a case. • I have the 128GB and 20GB is already used out of the box. • A fingerprint magnet on every part of this phone. • There is bloatware of programs you’ll almost certainly never use. • Not all apps will match with the display. Just like a tablet, you’re going to get black bars running down either side of the screen if it doesn’t automatically resize. • The movie 21:9 experience is only for videos that are adapted to that. Most YouTube and sitcoms will not offer this feature. It’ll becomes a 4:3 or a 16:9 display, depending on your choice (like any other phone) Bottom Line:__________ It’s a movie phone, plain and simple. As I mention in the first pro, you’re getting this phone because of the display. A 4k screen viewing, that can provide you a 21:9 immersion, is a great experience if you’re in your bed or on an airplane. You get complete customization on how your display will look and with a narrow premium design, you’re bound to turn heads. I had a great time watching shows on this phone. Still, there are a lot of issues on the phone itself. The camera app, the dim lighting, and the fact that if you’re left-handed this phone is going to be a little more of an inconvenience. The reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because of the viewing experience of this phone when watching movies. Without the 21:9 feature this would’ve been a three-star layout. I can only hope software updates will resolve the numerous issues that have lower the value of what the phone is. For a price this high, you should stick with Sony Xperia 10 Plus until the bugs are fixed. Overall: A movie theater in your pocket but nothing more than that. Hope I was a help to you. Love, Honest Reviewer.",164,"Sony"
"3082","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"true","The Xperia XZ Premium was the best phone I've ever had, and I've had it for over 2 years. It still holds up to current flagships despite that. It had a 4k screen, which current flagships still don't have. And after 2 years, the battery is still at 97% original capacity even after very heavy use and quick-charging. That said, Sony has the best battery management software I've seen. Their batteries hold up better than Samsung over time, which is the #1 reason I switched brands. This phone is great. 4k HDR OLED screen looks brilliant. The best screen out there. The 21:9 aspect ratio is awesome, and the phone just feels sexy. The only complaint I had with the XZ Premium was the loudness of the speakers. I'm happy to say these speakers get very loud and sound great except at max volume, where they struggle with clarity. The fingerprint scanner is solid, but I wished they integrated the power button in the reader like the XZ Premium. I haven't played with the cameras too much yet. But from the quick launch and basic settings, it works great. I can't wait to try out the video recording. Sony did a good job with the software here, to. I hear people complain about side-sense on Youtube videos, but I honestly haven't had any issues. I made it a point to use it and now it's awesome. It just takes getting used to. The battery is big enough to last all day for 99% of people. I'm a heavy user and it gets me through the day. It's not as big as some competitors, which is something Sony could improve on. Also, no wireless charging. I have to dock the battery life a star because of its small size. But considering the actual lifespan of the batteries in Sony phones of the past, I give it an extra star.",28,"Sony"
"3083","B07PHQ7FBP",4,"true","12/2019 Updated camera and fingerprint scanner section after December SW update that brought Android 10 to Xperia 1. #Android 10 If Xperia 1 was fast on Pie, it now flies on Android 10. Full gesture navigation only works on Xperia Home launcher currently. System-wide dark theme is a good addition for the OLED screen, potentially saving some power though I do not notice much difference in battery duration. Sony also tuned the speakers, and voice/music now has a little more bass and depth. In other words, more similar to iOS devices. # Tall screen The unique form factor is not always better than others, but once you get used to it, there is no turning back. Watching 21:9 content is simply stunning, web browsing is a breeze, but playing 16:9 content the display area is only slightly bigger than the 5.2"" XZ1. I do not have issue using the phone under bright sunlight. The tall screen can be hard to use one-handed at first, but instead of getting my thumb twisted, I found I became more fluent and can use the phone one-handed most of the time. The key to this is Side Sense..... # Side Sense Most of the press reviews said that Side Sense (SS) is gimmicky and inconsistent. Well, I beg to differ. With some tweaks, I find SS to be quite useful. Sony claimed the default setting use AI to detect gesture. Unfortunately, I don't think it works well. Therefore, I changed the setting to: 1. Pin the sensing area to fixed location. For example, the middle section of each side of the screen. 2. Change swipe length to ""Short."" 3. Change transparency to make the sensing area visible. 4. Change swipe up to recent apps view. 5. Pin frequently-used apps in the popped up list. With the above setting, SS functions as navigation bar and makes one-hand use second nature most of the time. # Camera [Updated 12/2019] I came from XZ1 so the interface of the camera app is fine for me. The camera system on Xperia 1 can produce great images, but as of August firmware, does have its quirks and sometimes needs user’s intervention to get the best result. This makes Xperia 1 feels like a DSLR at times, and can be good and bad depending on your taste. Personally, I think the flexibility of the three cameras make the phone fun to use, and the great image quality that can be extracted out of the camera system makes it rewarding even though manual adjustment is occasionally needed. Among the three cameras, the main one has the best image quality. The sharpness is stunning and even across the frame. Color is artistic and has a great depth. The camera has a big sweet spot, and even in lower-lit scenes, the image quality holds on reasonably well. I have people asked me if the photos I took with Xperia 1 were from DSLR. No kidding, in the best circumstances, the images are that good. Telescope is a little bit softer and noisier. Color also does not have the same depth as the main camera, but at least the tone is similar. Telescope can at times hunt for focus, and needs switching to 1x and back to sort of reset the calculations. The wide-angle camera is the weakest in terms of dynamic range, I feel like only about 80-90% of the main camera. It also can show a different color profile than the other cameras, especially in low-light conditions. Thankfully, sharpness is similar to telescope lens. Even though the image quality is the weakest of the three cameras, the wide viewing angle opens up a lot of opportunities, and therefore is my favorite one. I am not a fan of portrait mode, which produces fake-bokeh, and Xperia 1 does not change my perception. The result is passable, but I can often spot imperfections when looking closely, especially when the background is complex. There are a few issues before September SW update e.g. video stabilization issue, slower processing. Those issue are mostly gone after September update. The December Android 10 update brought the camera app on par with Xperia 5, and I found the following improvements: - Digital zoom is significantly improved, at least for ratio <=2x. The photos are more than useable, and the reach is now effectively 4x. - Noise reduction seems slightly improved, as edges and textures look cleaner. The good thing about Xperia flagships is that Sony updates the firmware frequently. So hopefully future incremental improvements will still be brought to Xperia 1. # Fingerprint issue [Updated 12/2019] The FP scanner on Xperia 1 is known to be finicky, and can have FP recognition issue. Sony has tuned the scanner several times along the monthly SW updates, but the issue is never fully resolved. People worked around the issue by adding several entries for the same finger, and usually this improved the recognition rate to an acceptable level. After moving to Android 10, I re-scanned my FP and alas, the recognition rate is almost 100%! Maybe something was changed in Android 10, but I doubt it because I have another FP (that has only one entry) that still has low recognition rate. # Conclusion The phone is... special. It is a phone you buy with your right-brain. It is a phone you need to use it in person to appreciate (or hate). It has some quirks, and image quality is still not as good as the best in fully automated mode. But at the end of the day does it matter? When the phone works (and it works well most of the time), it feels convincing. So it is a phone worth trying, but be prepared, the ride can be bumpy depending on your preference and taste.",20,"Sony"

"3085","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"true","This phone is quite beautiful. I upgraded from the XZ premium. The OLED screen is a nice upgrade and the each color is well lit in low light. The newly introduced Cinema Pro app with the 3 lens really is a seller. Pictures taken are really sharp and has a Cinema look to it. Other than that, not much has changed from the XZ Premium experience. Finger print sensor is really accurate and sensitive. It's also seperate from the power button, on the XZ they were the same button. Probably, my most liked feature is how fast the phone charges versus the the XZ. Expect the phone to be fully charged in an hour or less from 0%. The speakers are decent,not the loudest but loud enough to satisfy you in a low noise room. There is no headphone jack, sadly, but the phone does come with the adapter. Downsides: The screen is not too bright at 2/5 setting. I have to adjust the brightness settings to 55-65% just to achieve the same level of brightness as the XZ at 2/5 setting. Verdict: If you have an XZ Premium, you don't really need this upgrade. Unless you just want a phone with a very dedicated camera then... Drop that thousand dollar. I upgraded to this phone because my XZ broke on me.",8,"Sony"

"3087","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"true","This is one gorgeous phone! The screen is so rich, especially with 4K material, that it's hard to put into words!

"3088","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"true","I've had the Xperia 1 for a week now and I love it. Top notch design, gorgeous 4k screen. I thought the screen ratio would bother me but it doesn't. Audio quality is excellent just like my HP Elite X3, although the Xperia 1 seems to have lower gain - I need to boost the volume. The screen can be a bit slippery, I never use a case but it never slipped my hands due to the better grippability due to the screen ratio. Case would just ruin the gorgeous design. I find the front camera with no zoom odd. I wish Sony put a 40MP+ camera on the normal lens, and 20MP+ on the others on the rear esp since this is their flagship.

"3101","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"false","The 4K 21: 9 Cinema Wide display is just phenomenal and with the 6.5"" height you have more information on the screen than ever before. Meaning better productivity because you're not wasting time scrolling and searching - it's all right there in front of you. The display is the most important part of the phone because it's what you interact with and that alone is what makes this phone better. Just simply going through setup menus I noticed there were less steps simply because there is so much more on the screen. The text and fonts are just crisp and easier to read than other displays. Though like most phones it's a bit difficult to read in the direct sunlight. Qualcomm's snapdragon 855 Processor seems powerful enough and fast for the mobile computer with a phone and camera app that this Sony Xperia 1 really is. Sound is rich with plenty of amplification to hear without a headset. The mobile was intuitive enough to ask and transfer all my contacts and apps as soon as it was powered up with a new SIM, so anyone can do it without reading a manual or asking a tech. Only Sony would have this tip top Cinema Pro 4k video recorder that is has more settings than my action camera. With a 512Gb micro SD I should be able to make some decent length movies. The 3 lens camera is far more than adequate for me, and much better than my last two phones. Easy phone to hold because it is narrow enough at the width for the average size hands to grip well. I have large hands so I prefer the grip with the extra width added by the case which makes it fit my hand better. I hate to put a case on such a beautiful phone, but I'm too clumsy not to use one. More intuitive controls with the thumb print reader on the side where you grasp the phone and there is single hand side intuitive controls. Look the phone is gorgeous with the top display, top processor, a 3-lens camera with good movie creation capability. Yes, I definitely recommend this phone if your in the market and want the top display today.",3,"Sony"
"3102","B07PHQ7FBP",4,"false","The Sony Xperia 1 is a stunning smartphone. It comes in a beautiful, near bezel-less frame with a 6.5 inch screen and a unique 21:9 aspect ratio. It features a 4K OLED screen and quality speakers for an optimal movie-watching experience. However, it lacks a 3.5mm audio jack, so you will need either Bluetooth headphones or a headphone jack to USB-C dongle. It comes pre-loaded with Android Pie (v9.0) out of the box. The Xperia 1 has 6 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of internal storage, which can be expanded with a micro-SD card. It also features a 12 megapixel camera with three lenses for zoom and low-level light situations. The 6GB RAM makes the Xperia 1 great for gaming; I have yet to experience any lag or slowdown while playing, and the phone rarely heats up while in use. The camera is specially designed for recording video, and comes with an onboard video editor. Streaming movies is great with the 21:9 aspect ratio, but when streaming YouTube or other videos, you will experience some letterboxing while watching. Videos shot in the usual 16:9 ratio will leave black bars on either end of your screen. It's tolerable, but watching videos in the 4:3 ratio will leave nearly half of the screen unused. Although the Xperia 1 is tall, it still feels great to hold, even with one hand. There are several tap and swipe gestures implemented to make operating the phone easier with one hand. The battery life is about average. You can expect about 4-5 hours of straight, screen-on use, or a day's worth of normal usage. The USB-C connector allows for quick charging. You can get a full charge in less than 2 hours. The only nitpicks I have with the phone is that the screen does not get very bright, and that the phone automatically restarts every time the SIM card is inserted or removed. Overall, I really like the Sony Xperia 1 and would recommend it to others. It may not be for everyone, but it's a solid smartphone that is great for watching movies. Rating: 4/5 stars",3,"Sony"
"3103","B07PHQ7FBP",3,"false","Final Update: I ended up ordering another Samsung Galaxy.. Why? Many items this phone will not blue tooth connect, the main thing being my car stereo and my Sony headphones. It also would not connect to my blue tooth speaker system at home, my mini speaker system, and other items. Also, the phone is missing the earphone jack. Finally, many carriers don't support SONY phones. I was going to change carriers and was going to have to buy another phone because they do not support Sony phones. What will I miss about this phone? It charges fully in about an hour. The size is like a regular house phone. The phone is not fragile, many nights I lay on top of it while it is charging. It is just cool to have a phone not everybody has. The 3* rating is because the phone will not Bluetooth connect to SONY products. My car stereo is Sony and my main headphones are Sony. It will not Bluetooth connect to these items. It does Bluetooth connect to Alltel. You can use regular headphones with the adapter to connect. Do I recommend this phone? No, because tho sleek, it is a pain in the a.........s........s to own. Also, it will not Bluetooth connect to Sony products. How weird is that? …….......... Original review below was online getting ready to buy the latest Samsung ; an upgrade from the S7 when (coincidentally: wink, wink) Amazon asked me if I wanted to try out a phone. I really was hesitate. The last two phones I reviewed were knock offs of name brands and I was very upset that I had gotten rid of my good phone for the reviewed phone. FFd to the Xperia and it is actually a HIGH END phone. It is sleek (Pretty), as big as a house phone so you really feel like you are on your phone and not a calculator, and it comes LOADED. This phone retails for $949.00. I personally always buy my phones off e6ay so I can't say I would pay that, but for folks that buy the I9hone and other high end phones this is definitely worth it. Great pictures, clean and crisp, and quick. My prepaid data had slowed down and you could tell with the S7; it is not as noticeable with this phone. Do I recommend? YES; if you are ANTI-apple like I am then consider this phone along with a Samsung. P.S., the phone came charged two weeks ago and when I went to the T-Mobile store for the transfer, it still had 13%. My S7 is always drained down to zero. The reviewed phone just comes with the charging cable; no headphones. You MUST have the charging cable; it is much bigger than the old Android charging cable. It is the C cord. Cons: The phone is too big to use one handed. The screen can be reduced to one handed use in the settings. Once I get a case I will try it out. Without a case, the phone is too long and slippery. 2. It is hard to fit in a small purse. 3. You probably will have to wait on running band holders and other special holders since it is so long. 4. Someone said it does not have a headphone jack. I will have to check on this. Because it is so slippery, I taped it in the carton it came in. Once the case arrives, I will be able to test out more features Update 1:the Bluetooth will not connect to your car stereo. Bluetooth issues are common google search issues. I may have to go back to my s7. I listen to videos via Bluetooth everyday in my car and need Bluetooth. 2. The adapter for the earphone jack goes in the charging port. Basically, you can't use the phone jack and charge at the same time 3. My USB in the car just goes to ringtones. I can't get YouTube videos to play using USB with the phone 4. To stop the phone from vibrating with music, you press the volume button and dynamic vibration will appear",2,"Sony"
"3104","B07PHQ7FBP",4,"false","This phone looked so nice and is larger than my current phone. I wanted to keep it for myself but I decided to give it to my son because the phone he had was older than mine and this one looked like a good phone to use for playing games, which I don't do. His words: Sound quality: The sound from the phone is acceptable. The phone is best used with a Bluetooth speaker or headphones which was perfect for me because I hate wires. The phone does not have an audio jack however, came with the required cable to use a pair of wired headphones and a set of headphones. Video quality: Sony stated they produced the first phone with a display 4K HDR OLED CinemaWide Display and lived up to it's promise with amazing video quality. I've watched a lot of movies on YouTube and other online channels and the footage looks fantastic. I've also downloaded a few games that look great; I would suggest getting a controller to connect to the phone to make game play easier. The length is good but my your thumbs may still block the screen. Design: The phone is slim which feels great in my hands yet very long. It has a very appealing aesthetic but can be cumbersome to hold and manage some functions like texting or making a call. My phone came in black which looks great. I'm sure the other color options of purple and white look amazing as well. The phone is also very light; when I first opened the box I thought it would be heavier. Camera: The camera takes really good pictures and the video quality is excellent also. I've taken a few shots inside and out with very little distortion in photos or video from light however, I have yet to try it at night. Storage: The phone comes with 128GB of space. I really have no clue how I'll use that much space but I'll probably fill it with movies and games. The phone comes with apps that assist video and photo alteration which are good. It also has additional assistance apps for managing any games that you may download which is a nice bonus. Cons: The only downside for me was having Google pushed on me at every turn while activating my phone. It's a simple push of a button to opt out however, on a unlocked phone I would think it would come up less. There are also a view other features of the phone like ""side sense""and other others I don't have a use for. The phone does not provide the ability to turn off these functions or notifications which is a negative. Also all of the buttons for the phone are on the right hand side of the phone. It takes some getting used to to not accidentally hit a button. Due to some of the cons I would also bring the price down a bit closer to the 750-800 range; the last time I checked it was somewhere between 949 to 1,000. Overall: I would give this phone a 4.5 out 5. There are a few cons but they are so small and very easy to overlook. It's an amazing phone that I'm thankful to have. I would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a new phone.",1,"Sony"
"3105","B07PHQ7FBP",4,"false","Let me start off this review by saying the Sony Xperia 1 is not compatible with the Sprint network which is super disappointing. Sprint couldn’t give me a timeline or any info on when or if it will ever be compatible in the future. I currently have an iPhone XS Max so I will compare it to that. I found this phone to be much thinner then the XS Max but it is also taller. I’m actually amazed by how paper thin it is. It’s easier to grip in your hand then the XS Max. Right out of the box the touch screen is super sensitive, no need to calibrate. The graphics and colors are phenomenal. Much clearer and crisper then my iPhone XS Max. Perfect for watching movies or playing games. It does take longer then my iPhone to reach a full charge BUT the battery does last longer which is another plus for the Xperia. Overall it’s a excellent phone. In some ways it’s better then my iPhone. They are definitely giving iPhone a run for its money!",1,"Sony"
"3106","B07PHQ7FBP",3,"false","I really wanted to like this phone, but it’s been so buggy and glitchy that I’ve been miserable using it. I’ve had my service connected to it for three weeks and I’ve had more issues than I ever did with my iPhone. The screen is absolutely stunning and the photo quality is superb. The fingerprint ID never has any issues. I mainly find issues when opening apps I run very frequently- my son’s monitor app and a few smart home devices I use. These apps are vital to my daily life so until the phone is more compatible with common iOS apps, I will be sticking with my iPhone.",1,"Sony"

"3113","B07PHQ7FBP",1,"true","update Nov 4, 2019 This phone is crap if you are a tmobile customer. I have been with them for 11 years and the Xperia 1 is driving me nuts considering that I paid $1040 for the newest of the new that they (sony) said would work on Tmobile. TMo also said that it is compatible with some but not all of the bands that they use for LTE and 4g. I cannot stand this PHONE. The phone does not work well, nor does the GPS. After months of traveling by driving 10K plus miles across this USA I can say that this phone is crap on T-Mobile if rated by it's modem alone. My friend has an Iphone 8 and it outperforms this CRAPIERA tenfold with connectivity to cellular, wifi and GPS. I lost signal more times than I care to count while driving across the country. It doesn't matter if I was in Den, Mem, Raliegh, Nashville, NOLA, Shreveport, DFW or on the roads between those cities, this phone has spotty cellular and GPS signal everywhere I have been and in between too. I rely on Google GPS daily and especially while traveling outside of state. It lost the GPS signal so many times. As a comparison I drove from San Antonio Texas to Vegas using my XPERIA Z3, thats android 5.02 in January. Not once did i lose GPS (no audible notification) or the ability to make a phone call (that i noticed). I cant use my phone as a phone and cant use it for GPS because they are not reliable. My travel buddies iphone 8 never lost GPS or the ability to make phone calls, not once, where this Sony did so constantly. The ""GPS SIGNAL LOST"" alert blasts through the car stereo which becomes so much more annoying with each continuous notification) I have traveled a lot since getting the Craperia 1 in July and only now (Nov) have I been able to call TMobile to try to sort things out. Well it turns out that this phone was not designed to work with all of TMos preferred frequency bands. It is set up to work on 3G primarily, being the 1900mhz Frequency in particular. The problem is that TMo and the other majoy carriers are shifting their signals to to a frequency range that is much much lower in the 600MHz (Band 71) & the 700MHz (Band 12) range. If i were near anywhere nearby to a TMo antenna/Tower I would likely experience wonderful service even though it is outdated and currently being replaced. The problem is that I have always had borderline issues with obtaining a strong signal be it LTE or 4G on any of my previous phones while at my house. That is why they (TMo) gave me a cell spot for use at my house. Had i known this phone wasn't fully compatible with TMobiles network I would have not even considered buying it. Frustratingly even after the restore that it was suggested I do today I am still not able to have a steady conversation while on wifi. I really only decided to do the reset because of all of the below issues that I am also having. I did it in hopes of repairing those issues and hopefully helping with my connectivity. time will tell with the below isssues but as for the connectivity over cellular, NO DICE! it still performs horribly while on a phone call. I'm going to waste more of my time now trying to figure out why it doesn't work well on WiFi either. I dont know if this is an Andriod Pie thing or Sony but you can no longer LOCK a text from being deleted. The phone has died over night causing me to miss my alarm because for whatever reason it does not want to go to sleep all of the time. I have to manually put it to sleep every time. I can't just expect it to do as I told it to in the sleep settings. I cannot send texts immediately. Memes, Pictures and longer texts take sometimes HOURS to be sent. Whether on wifi or not. - probably has to do with the incompatibility with TMos networks You cant see the phone while outdoors. it just wont get bright enough and just when you think it is bright enough you will get a message saying that it is about to overheat so please turn it back down. Some will say to use the adaptive brightness or custom feature. Neither of them fix the problem and I bet that those same people live somewhere other than where it gets above 90 degrees frequently and probably work indoors. I So much for Cinema Pro, You cant use it unless you are indoors or it is a cloudy day. THIS PHONE SUCKS! I WANT MY MONEY BACK DO NOT BUY they cant fix the message icon issue where it constantly displays that there is a text message.. They can't fix the issue with not being able to Click on an address or phone number in a text and get a pop up with options. The screen just flashes. They tell you to delete the messaging apps cache and whatever to fix the problem. It will then work for an unknown amount of time before it reverts back to not working again. Daily i have to fix this. The speaker near the bottom of the phone is like 7 times louder than the one by the earpiece and it has much of the EQ range that it needed for clarity in speech. A lot of the sound effects are in stereo so if you have one of the two speakers covered you are going to be missing out on half of the audio. The earpiece speaker and the one by the bottom are not tuned the same. The moment you cover that speaker with either you hand while in landscape or while sitting it on your belly to rest while viewing its in a vertical position you will notice a SIGNIFICANT drop in the volume as the speaker is now blocked and the one by the earpiece is weaker in volume in comparison. The audio then becomes unintelligible. I'm probably going to return it for another one here REAL QUICK because of the following charging issue: (update I couldn't return it because it took ONE spill and chipped the black finish off the frame) Great design Sony! I have had the phone for 9 days. Last night while i was in bed reading and charging the phone began to cycle through charging and not charging with the slightest of movement from the cable. I cannot emphasize ""slightest"" enough. This happened a good 8 times in less than a minutes before i finally said screw it and unplugged the phone to continue reading without being disturbed by its cycling and notifications. Today i let it die all the way and plugged it in to fully charge it. Yes, this phone charges like no other I have ever owned or seen before. It absolutely blows my mind with how quickly it does the job. I was away from it for thirty minutes and when i returned i noticed that the LED was not illuminated as it should be while charging. I wiggled the phone and got nada. I then tapped the power button to see where the charge was at and to my surprise it began to power on (so i thought) but was actually just acknowledging that it had been plugged in to charge which it then began doing so. I Cant use the phone while it is chargning without disturbances unless it is in a completely static position. Do I have to check it once i plug it in to make sure the USB-C is seated correctly 9 days out of the box? Yes, it is very slippery so get a case for it. Dont buy the $12.99 Tyrain ones from Amazon labeled ""smooth"" red, blue etc. They are **bleep** for cases because they barely cover maybe 60% of the phones edges, besides being equally slippery. Dont buy the sony style cover for it either. I got the white one. Its not white any more after used some cream on my face and then grabbed my phone. The white case is now all rusted in color, even the clear plastic spine/face cover has become discolored. Ok, so I'll bite the bullet on that one... whatever but that doesn't explain why the plastic cover/face is falling apart two months after purchase (it was $60 from the UK) two of the corners on the ""lid"" are pealing back and have become sharp and frayed. I did nothing to start its demise. yet Sony has a no warranty on accessories policy.. not even for lifelong customers. While watching videos on FB with the volume at one level, say max, and then a commercial takes place, when it returns to the video the volume is significantly lowered with no ability to return it to a higher level. No clue if this is Android 9.0, Xperia 1 or FB but it really sux. This only happens while using the phone speakers, not while on Bluetooth. headphones While watching videos on FB in vertical mode the volume will be at one level but when you switch to landscape mode it will again lower to something less than where it had been with no way of returning to the previous volume besides rotating the screen to a vertical position. I am an airhead and later figured out that this is because the lower speaker is 7 times louder than the one by the ear. Once you cover it up or hinder its output in any way you will notice a significant loss in volume / clarity. I got this phone because I love the Xperia line, period. I didn't get it to play games primarily though the remote PS4 play option was definitely a selling point for me. I haven't played any games that way just yet though i have played PUBG and Fortnite. Both have frozen while loading the games. The phone wont do anything until I manually close the game. hmpf. I'll reset the setting to 30fps and see if that helps as I am currently on 60fps.. you know, the ones they bloated about being so awesome. smh While playing PUBG yesterday the navigation bar started popping up and not hiding, preventing me from seeing a portion of the screen and subsequently screwing with my game-play because i couldn't access some of the game features. I had to rotate the phone 180 degrees to get to those functions. When i did so the nav bar just went to the other end of the phone. It displayed the LOCK symbol, as it should since thats how i set it up for game-play. It had worked flawlessly for the day or so prior when I had played, but not this time. Youre supposed to tap the lock and then the nav bar functions would be visible and available for usage. I couldn't unlock it while it was on either side of the phone to use the NAV bar to save my life so I ended up having to restart the phone. I keep getting texts, reading them and then the Text logo continues to display that I have (x) amount of texts, until i restarted the phone. Sony and Android do not care to fix this and there is no known repair other than to manually delete the cache in the messaging app daily. I am with T Mobile and have Visual Voicemail. I have so far gotten three system notifications that I will have to manually sync my VM. I haven't gotten any voicemails since installing the app so I cant say whether or not it is functioning properly anyways. I can say that the system keeps showing me the standard VM notification icon at the top of the phone which is weird since I haven't gotten a single voicemail since installing the app. I just upgraded from the Xperia Z3 (yes it lasted this long) and on that Android version, 5.02, i was able to override the stock VM notification when i installed the Visual VM from TMo so that i wasn't getting duplicate notifications. I have not seen that option on this build. - three months later I tried to use it and the same issue was occurring numerous times a day. TMo visual VM app on the Play store is smothered with complaints about this same issue. I called Tmo and they said that it is a patching issue that they have been made aware of but that it is an Android fix that is needing to be done for it to work properly. I have deleted the app again until further notice from Tmo It really isnt that bright of a phone while outdoors. I knew that going in but didn't know how bad it really was until i started using it outside. I love how fast it is and how comfortable in the hand it is. every time you brighten the screen to 100% you will get a notification about how prolonged usage at that brightness level could damage the screen. It pops up EVERY TIME and there is no way to make it not appear again. Too bad that I have to turn the screen up all the way to see the damn phone while outdoors. what the hell were they thinking when they designed this POS? if you work outdoors, BUY A DIFFERENT PHONE. As for the fingerprint reader and facial recognition I am pretty happy with them both. it may take a time or two every now and then but for the most part they make access simpler more often than not. - update three months later. I take back what I said about both the facial and fingerprint options as they are both CRAP crap CRAP! I work in the dark a lot or I am inside without perfect lighting so the facial recognition doesn't always see my face. I get it. But my fingerprint doesn't change. I have 4 fingerprints saved and more often than not I find myself saying screw it and going for the manual log in because the scanner wont recognize a single one of them. 60 days later. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, IT IS NOT RELIABLE. CAN'T SEE IT WHILE OUTSIDE ON A SUNNY DAY. CAN'T USE THE CAMERA BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THINGS AND BESIDES THAT IT OVER HEATS, OVER HEATS AND OVER HEATS ALL WHILE DOING NOTHING. I live in Texas. This phone was not designed to withstand our hot sunny days. SONY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ITS MOBILE CUSTOMERS. I'M ON MY 10TH XPERIA IN 7 YEARS. THE OTHERS WERE BETTER BY MEANS OF BUGS AND FLUID USAGE. SCREW YOU SONY FROM A LOYAL AND SCREWED CUSTOMER OF YOUR PRODUCTS.",7,"Sony"
"3114","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"true","All the manufacturer's make great phones, so picking a top tier phone is purely a subjective affair at this point. I'm not a fan of curved screens, in screen or back of the phone fingerprint readers, I don't use wireless charging. My last phone was a Sony Xperia XZs which I had for over 2 years, it is the same width and depth as the Xperia 1, the Xperia 1 is decidedly taller. I have also owned Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G6 phones, I prefer Sony's design language (purely subjective). Screen: Majestic, incredible. The 21:9 aspect ratio is a huge upgrade, you fit so much more onto the screen, very good for productivity. Fingerprint reader: Solid, my favorite style which is on the side of the phone. Occasionally I need to do 2 attempts, I think the XZs was slightly more reliable. Camera: Initial reports are good. I really liked my camera on my XZs although it suffered in lowlight, but it shot great video. From what I have seen in 2 days the Xperia 1 has better detail and the 3 shooting modes are a welcome addition. Battery: Would have been nice if it was bigger, but phone has lasted without a hitch for full day usage thus far with around 50% left at night. Size: I was never a fan of huge phones, and while this phone is tall it is narrow enough to be a joy to use and hold. Speakers: My XZs had a terrible speakerphone function, the Xperia 1 has great speakers, nice clarity, and they're loud. Overall: Fantastic phone. I wish the back wasn't glass so I could use it without a case, that's my biggest knock. I'll update as I use the phone more.",6,"Sony"
"3115","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"true","Coming from sony xperia XZ Premium is a nice upgrade in my opinion. the camera is one of the best when you know how to take picture in manual mode. auto mode is more of a hit or miss but i take my pictures in manual mode always so this is not a problem for me. the colors are nice and natural and not fake like other brands. the sound quality is there and with headphones sony shines the most. the 1000mx3 that came free are the best pair of headphones i own to date, amazing sound quality and noise cancelling is if not the best. battery life is good for what i use it for during the day but if you a heavy user you will wish sony put a bigger battery on this beast of a phone. my only issue so far was the side sensor on the screen but i could careless, i turn it off in option. my other issue was getting used to the new way of getting things done because everything is different but after a day i was already used to it. i wish sony would had just made the finger sensor the same as the power . amazing phone!! highly recommend",3,"Sony"
"3116","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"true","Beautiful phone, gorgeous display, fast near stock android experience When I purchased the phone, I was a little worried about the height of the phone, also camera quality based on my past experience with Sony phones. Been using the iPhone XS Max since it came out. I must say that Sony really improved on the camera quality this time with the Xperia 1. The 21/9 aspect ratio is actually really comfortable to hold in the hand. The only thing I recommend is to get a case coz the phone itself is a bit slippery.

"3121","B07PHQ7FBP",5,"false","Update 8/14/19 5 stars now! I've been using this phone as my daily for over 3 weeks now and I gotta say, it's phenomenal. The screen is great for vids but also text and reading is very crisp. I sorta slammed it for the speakers, but there's a Dolby Atmos engine that you can enable from the drop down shade, with various audio profiles, with mixer. This produces some very rich combos and is louder. The power mgmt is great, despite the smaller batter in this class and I'm loving the easy unlock with the side FP reader. There’s a lot to review on this phone and many have gone over specs and standard features I won’t cover here. Being a fan of 4K HDR home entertainment, I was truly interested in how the Sony X1 screen looks and feels. On the right side of the device starting from the top and working down is the volume rocker, the fingerprint reader, power button then a camera button. You hold the phone naturally and your thumb is right on the fingerprint reader, it’s very responsive and once enrolled has worked every time. I also enrolled my left hand index and digitus medius fingers and for me, it wasn’t a challenge to unlock. I mention this because at first one might think ‘wow they are ignoring the left handed user’. I’d suggest give it a shot first before judgement. The Xperia 1 has a beautiful screen and a narrow build, which really feels good in the hand. As I let others cautiously hold it they immediately commented on the fit in hand. It’s thin, but well-built and the narrow design is going to have a lot of engineers thinking about screen size and comfort. But this one is really tall… Candy bar phones are back on the menu! It’s glossy shiny black and has the fingerprints to prove it, but hey we polish our phones all the time now right? I copied over a 4K HDR rip (err backup) and though it looked great, I’ve also tested a few 4K ‘HDR’ vids on the web, very impressive. Pro tip: Using the stock vid player app try changing to ‘creator mode’ to get ‘faithful reproduction’ and 4K. Another tip: When in YouTube just drag the screen ‘out’ with two fingers to expand to the largest viewing area the content will display. Also make sure you choose 4K content from the settings, most likely the app will default to 1080p or lower, depending on your connection speed. When in the native app, double tap to auto fill the screen. These tips made my experience and showing off the phone’s epic screen much more enjoyable. For recording, the phone comes with “Cinema Pro” for video. It also has a fairly standard camera app. There are a few Sony experience items of varying interest: -A vibrate setting called “Dynamic Vibration” that you can adjust which is in sync with the audio playing, give it a force feedback feel for the audio output. -Home launcher with a back and home button, but no ‘recent’ tap button. To get to recent apps swipe up on the home. -The drop down shade has standard toggle and brightness management options with a settings button, although very tiny. -Uses Google Voice for automation, with the widget installed on the home screen and swiping left takes you to the more detailed Google assistant app itself. Both of these can be disabled by holding down on the wallpaper to manage the ‘Home settings’. -Volume down and power button for quick screenshot (or hold power button and select screenshot) -In the settings there is an Xperia Assist app with some battery management, storage clean up wizards and some tips. -Not a lot of wonky pre-installed apps, standard stuff like FB, NF and a few games which have a proper disable option. Very clean delivery on this unit. - No tool needed for the sim tray here, just a clean fingernail and you can load the tray and yes, an SD card for storage. What’s not included? I’ve been used to wireless charging for some time now and most would say at this price point it’s a shame not to have it. But it does have the now standard USB-C which is nice so you don’t have to worry about plugging it up wrong. Except for my nightstand, wherever I have wireless charging I also have USB-C for faster quick charging so I’m not as attached to wireless as I used to be. To drive a screen this size I would have preferred a larger battery than the included 3330mAh. The phone doesn’t have a headset jack, but does come with a standard ear bud set and USB-C to 3.5 mm adapter. Be sure to remove the plastic film off the headset controller, it covers the mic! It’s an offset design with one ear bud length about 8 inches the other earbud 20 inches away from the controller. It’s a MH750. The speakers are located on the bottom (facing down) and the ear piece facing forward. At moderate levels they are fine but going past 75% gets really tinny, close to some distortion. I’d like to see an improvement here to match the cinema level quality of the screen. I’d like to see an improvement to brightness. A screen like this should really have a glow option (max bright) and I just wasn’t seeing that. It’s not dark it just doesn’t go nova. I’m going to monitor the reply section, post questions if you like and I’ll test or report what you want to know about! Overall, I love this phone, its zippy smooth and mainly due to its screen and feel in the hand, cool fingerprint placement, it’s a great experience. If there were a bit more brightness and battery 4.5 stars would have been 5.",12,"Sony"
"3122","B07PHQ7FBP",3,"false","Update: If you like sending and receiving picture texts regularly you might want to wait until the bugs get worked out. I thought I had it fixed so I could send and receive twice but now it's glitching again and won't let me fix it. It's annoying af because now I have to send/receive pics thru FB messenger and that's ridiculous for the price of the phone. It also has issues with some games. (mainly some FB games) The screen glitches a bit. It doesn't interfere with playing but looks odd. I hope they fix the SMS issue soon tho cuz that could get old fast despite being able to swype lol. Still love the graphics and sound. Hate the sucky ringtones tho. As a diehard iPhone fan, I wasn't too sure about making the jump to an android phone but OMG the Sony Xperia 1 is amazing! The graphics, the speakers and sound, the game enhancer - wow! Some things are a PITA (pain in the...umm, yeah, lol) like figuring out the fingerprint reader (nearly pulled my hair out before I aced that one) and exiting from some of the FB games (OMG) but the annoyances are minor compared to what you're getting. The 4K OLED by itself makes the phone a no brainer gotta have one click buy but when you add in the Dolby Atmos sound and those sweet speakers, not to mention the way the vibration thing pulls you into the music when you're listening to your tunes or watching Youtube music videos or movies (you gotta experience it to understand cuz it can't be explained adequately). It's a whole nother dimension to treat the senses! I'm loving the triple lens camera, too. It takes amazingly fabulous pictures. (see the one I took of my food. Almost put a pic of my grandson but subbed in this instead cuz it's less personal. Still, gotta love the clarity and detail and that's just a photo OF the photo on the screen taken by another phone so imagine how it looks in person!) Can't wait to play with the new cinema recording function Cinema Pro, too. Can you tell I love this phone? All I can say is if you're on the fence and you like watching movies on your phone, or music videos, or just jamming to your tunes - with or without headphones - scroll up and grab it.

"3125","B07XF928ZP",3,"false","One thing you will notice about this phone right off the bat is that unlike many other phone it is actually tall and not wide. This makes the phone pretty good for holding in one hand as you do not have to worry about it being too wide and hard to grip however this makes it a bit narrow compared to many other phones. What I mean to say about this phone is that you get a longer phone with a ""6.1"" inch screen but you get a narrower view so the picture quality is unfortunately not the best as it tends to condense the picture due to the screen. This does however make it easier to operate with just one hand as you are able to easily reach the keys with one finger while holding the device. The phone itself is made of pretty sturdy material so you do not have to worry about the phone getting bent or anything like that. I would say to still get a case as many part of this phone is just temper glass so you can easily crack this phone if you drop it at the right angle. There is also some odd button placement with the finger print reader being on the side and you actually need to move you hand up on the phone to reach the power button and such. The touch screen is pretty nice and sensitive however if you happen to use a screen protector with this device that is temper glass the sensitivity actually goes down and the screen is less responsive due to the curve edges. The front camera for selfies and such is just an eight megapixel so you are just getting about the same quality as you would as other phones. There is nothing really special about the camera and it does come with facial recognition and such. The screen feels nice and you do not get any finger print residue when using the screen. The back camera is pretty nice with twelve megapixels. It takes a pretty nice picture. You are able to take pictures and video at high quality and it stabilizes the pictures so if you are a bit shaky you do not have to worry about blurry pictures. There is also a 3d scanning function which is great for making those 3d models. It does utilize three cameras like many other new phones that you may actually have and thus provides you with the best picture quality possible. This phone runs on android and it does need to be updated right out of the box. There is not too much bloatware so you do not have to worry about the device being slow. Honestly compared to many other phones this actually gives you one of the best stripped down form of android. There is suppose to be ""side sensors"" to make it easier to access and use the phone but honestly it is very glitch y. I would say out of five attempted it only worked one time. It has a solid 128 gigabytes with only 6 gb of ram which is significantly smaller than what samsung may offer with their 12 gb of ram phone. You are able to put a micro SD card into the phone however be aware that it will only use UHS-I SD cards so anything lower than that will not work with the phone. It utilizes a type c port to charge and does support fast charging. The problem is it only fast charges up to a certain percentage before slowing down. I was able to get from 0 to 50 percent in less than an hour but after that it took an additional two or so hours to get to fully charged. The battery life on this product is pretty nice. It can last pretty much a full day on usage and you do not have to worry about needing to recharge. The processor is pretty nice making it ideal for being a decent gaming phone if you want it to be. I am able to play games on this phone with ease however this does significantly make the phone warmer and the battery drains faster. The sound quality on this phone is unfortunately not the best compared to many other competitors. It only has one speakers and the sound is a bit low compared to many other phones. This being said you will get okay sound from it and it does the job when playing videos. Be aware that there is no headphone jack nor is there an adapter provided. I have tried type c plug headphones and they work pretty well with the phone but I would suggest bluetooth headphones. This does have the usual security feature with pin, password, fingerprint, and facial recognition. I would say the finger printer scanner is a bit annoying to get to as it is on the side and you need to move your hand a bit to get to the scanner. It also has a bit of a slower response time then many other phones. The facial recognition as well as a bit buggy. It worked about six out of ten times I have used it and it can vary based on the background and lighting. Overall I think this phone a bit pricey for what you get out of it. You can easily get better features and specs at a cheaper price for many other phones. You honestly get a pretty okay phone with decent specs but there are too many glitches on the phone such as the finger print reader. The sound quality as well is not the best but the dynamic vibration system is nice to have. The narrowness of the phone makes it a bit annoying to use when watching videos. The camera is nice as well but if you are trying to take 4k videos, then you do see a color difference compared to many other phones.",1,"Sony"
"3126","B07XF928ZP",3,"false","I had a SONY Experia phone a few years ago and then changed to Iphone - after a few years of being an ""Iphone Fanboy""; I decided to change back to Android and order this phone. What I Like: SONY makes an excellent quality product and this phone is no exception. Build quality is second to none with ample use of quality materials - no ""hunk of plastic"" here. Screen image is excellent with dark blacks and bright colors from the HD OLED screen. The 21:9 2520x1080 display is great for watching movies (albeit a little small IMHO) Performance is excellent - phone features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor with 6GB of RAM - a true powerhouse! Apps open quickly and screens move fluidly. Three lens camera is featured - much like the new Iphone. this offers multiple focal lengths - ie the equivalent of 16mm, 26mm & 52mm lenses for standard to wide angle photos. Android operating system provides flexibility for the user versus being locked into Apple's proprietary nonsense! Phone is ""unlocked"" so it can be used with different carriers 128 GB of storage is more than ample for most folks unless you start saving huge video files. Phone is water resistant - don't go swimming but a brief immersion or splashes of water should not be an issue. Battery life is sufficient (then again most new phones are) battery degradation over time and apps that sap power witll affect this! What I Don't Like: Well there are a few things - photo quality is not the best out there - especially in low light situations. you would think that SONY with their rich history of digital photography would have among if not the best camera out there - just not the case. Again, probably more than sufficient for most folks, just not class leading. The aspect ratio, although great for watching movies is not so great IMHO for other tasks - let's face it, our phones have become our ""new laptops"" and are used for a multitude of tasks - not just making calls. Website display is funky at best, photos do not display well and many apps are not formatted for this screen and result in ""black bands"" on either side. Case selections are minimal - you can find literally hundreds of cases for Iphone or Samsung phones - not nearly the selection for the SONY product. Should be obvious but not compatible with Apple ""Carplay"" - I recently upgraded my car stereo and loved the interface between the phone and the head unit. Totally forgot about this aspect when ordering this and now have a phone that will not connect with my Carplay - this actually may be a ""deal breaker"" for me. Price is also rather high - nearly $800 for a phone that is not a true ""large screen"" So a mixed bag of good and bad - If you are a SONY fan and do not use Carplay then this might be the phone for you.",1,"Sony"
"3127","B07XF928ZP",2,"true","The fingerprint scanner works 2 out of 10 times. My worst experience on Android yet. The Sony skin on top Android has not been properly tested. If you miss a call, it keeps on showing 1 on the top right of the phone icon, even after viewing all missed calls and clearing notifications. Was on chat with customer service about this and ended up factory resetting it. In this case, if you get one more missed call, 1 clears from the phone icon. There are a few threads about this issue on the Sony mobile forum. The camera is pretty decent, its performance is very good. USB-A to 3.5mm dongle is ridiculous. The headphones should have been USB-A or the phone should have had a 3.5mm jack. Audio quality however is very good. I really wanted to like this phone, but the fingerprint scanner and software just dont cut it. They are the worst part of this phone.",1,"Sony"

"3129","B07XF928ZP",2,"false","First Impression review.... while it has its good parts, well... while being a long time Sony fan...this did not impress. Will Update later if there are any great points to add. So, here for the good... performance is impressive, I used it with files from all 3 of my 360 cameras and and it will not skip a beat... It has a beautiful screen, bright and fluid So far, I can go all day and still have over 25% charge, My LG V40 is under 10% for the same average workload It has an IP rating, so, is protected from every day use Watching videos in the cinematic screen is a joy...just wish it was a bit bigger The ok... Cameras, well...they are ok... wish they would have added a TOF Sensor... the have a good range and pictures come out exposed good (Will test outside more, it has been overcast here in TX) Low light is ok, a bit slow...but...again...is low light Easy to handle for people with smaller hands. The Bad... $800???? Really...for a watered down Xperia 1.... yeah, with One Plus Competition, is hard to spend $800 for this phone. Long aspect ratio, while is fun to watch movies, is useless for most productivity, Dont know where they came out with the line ""perfect size and fit for your hand"" well, not for mine...nor the millions of people that love our big phones...sound like a Steve Jobs idea, remember when he said no one will buy a phone bigger than 3.5 inches??? I am ok when working on panoramas, but regular pictures are a pain to look at, websites, yeah...nope... I get it, Sony was trying to push the envelope, but I wonder who their focus group was...because, nope, not for today's phones where people do way more than watch movies Fingerprint reader on the side...again...focus group??? the placement is not natural for an index finger, yeah, I could register my middle finger, but that is not the natural way. The really bad... Did I mentioned price... yeah... With that, carriers, some dont even have it at all...so dont expect carrier deals or discounts...at least not yet also... dont expect to get a trade in value from this Cases... some...VERY limited...other than light protection, even the ""rugged"" ones are just light protection with cheap screen films... dont expect Otterbox or even Poetic to come up with one. Android Auto (Or Google Maps/Waze) ... wait until you see this skinny screen 3-5 feet away from you in the car... yup...that will remind you of the days of 5 in phones...if you are a big screen fan, long aspect ratio will not be for you, and if you are a small phone fan...this is too long...So, I am not sure who told Sony this was a great idea. Well, I wish this phone was the wider aspect ratio, I wish I could buy a good case to use it at work... other than Sony fans or people that will be watching media mostly, yeah, not many will buy this phone.. I wanted to love it...the performance is there...but the size and quirks added to the $800 price when you can get way more phone in a Note for $150 more or $200 cheaper on a One Plus.",7,"Sony"
"3130","B07XF928ZP",4,"false","I have been using this phone for a few weeks and think it's mostly great. The battery life is top notch. I play Pokémon Go, a game that is notorious for draining batteries to the point where players are often seen walking around carrying their phones tethered to external batteries if they plan to do it for more than an hour or two. I was able to get five hours straight out of a single charge. The processor and graphics speed are similarly excellent. Pretty much everything I do on the phone feels super snappy, a huge improvement over my previous Android device. The screen is a joy to behold. High pixel density, bright colors, just great. The camera is great too. It has three lenses as seems all the rage these days. I don't know how much difference that actually makes, but I've taken some really nice-looking photos with it. I do have some nits to pick, though. The side-mounted fingerprint reader doesn't work very well. More often than not, it fails enough times in a row that Android makes me type in my PIN instead. This rarely happened on my previous phone with a rear-mounted fingerprint reader. Surface area seems to make a big difference for fingerprint reading. A case is absolutely essential. This phone is super slippery without one. I used it for a couple of weeks this way, and there ware way too many close calls. Not just slipping out of my hands, but I even had it slide off tables a couple of times due to the minor amount of force provided by the weight of the charging cable. Buy a case. The US version of this phone only has one SIM card slot. I see from Sony's website that many countries have a dual-SIM version available, but not here. I wonder why. I found this feature very useful with a previous phone, because it allowed me to get a cheap low-usage voice-only SIM and a cheap data-only SIM for less total cost than most all-in-one plans. I know this type of mix-and-match behavior is much more common in other countries, but I think it could catch on here if more phones supported it. The phone has a ""side sense"" feature which uses some special sensors to activate certain features when you stroke or tap the very edge of the screen in very specific ways. I tried using it for a while but never quite mastered it (or found it to be worth mastering, to be honest), and have since disabled it. Now for my big pet peeve: the size. This phone is too large for practical one-handed use. This is hardly a unique issue; most smartphones made these days suffer from this major flaw. To its credit, this phone is a bit narrower than many, making it relatively easy to grip securely. Unfortunately the extra tall aspect ratio means that my thumb can only reach about half of the area of the screen. I too often find myself trying to shimmy the phone up and down in my hand to reach something on the top or bottom edges of the screen. Before my case arrived this was a pretty harrowing thing to do because of how slippery it is and how much glass was exposed to easy shattering in case of a drop. Now it's merely annoying. The large phone issue is so ever-present that there are even a number of workarounds built into the system to deal with it. Android has a ""one-handed mode"" that basically shrinks everything down into an area you can reach with your thumb, leaving giant black borders of nothingness. The built-in keyboard also has its own one-handed mode that shoves all the keys into one side of the screen or the other. The split-screen mode can also be used to shove an app into half (or three-quarters) of the screen. The ""side sense"" feature seems most promising for giving another way to access menu options that would otherwise require reaching all the way to the top of the screen. None of these hacks would be necessary if they simply made the phone small enough that you can reach the whole screen with your thumb! Complaints aside, I do still use this phone every day, enjoy its positive aspects, and find that they mostly outweigh the shortcomings. I just wish it wasn't so huge!",2,"Sony"
"3131","B07XF928ZP",5,"false","Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  Short story: Overall, I recommend this phone and is replacing my “old phone” (bought 3 months ago). This is a keeper! Below the full review: I compared this with my Huawei P30 Pro which I bought for his excellent camera (according to the reviews) and I have been using this Xperia during last 30 days as my phone so this is not a short-term review, I actually have been using this phone. So, here are the results of this comparison. What I like: Very lightweight Camera is faster and overall a better video/photo Can be held with 1 hand: At the beginning I felt was too narrow but after a couple of weeks, you get used to that and even I started to enjoy it Great screen to play videos (after a while you will stop to noticing the narrow screen as actually is wide) Fingerprint reader is very fast and accurate. Fast charge. What I do not like: Battery life is not the best Headphones will be connected via USB-C and the included earphones are 3.5mm; an USB-C to 3.5mm is included Not on-screen finger print. Limited choice of cases (at least at this moment 12/2019) I know this is not SONY’s fault but be aware. I have been using with AT&T with zero issues. Remember that main use of these things is make phone calls and quality of voice is great. I do not use my phone for gaming so I cannot comment about that but for my use (phone, browsing, productivity with email, office, teams etc.) this is a workhorse, powerful processor. Huge storage capacity and expandable via microSD card. On attached picture when you see 2 phones, the Xperia is always on top.",1,"Sony"
"3132","B07XF928ZP",5,"false","The first thing you notice about this phone is the tall shape, with a 6.1 inch OLED screen you imagine a huge screen, but no, it’s quite narrow, making it easier for one hand use, the design is beautiful, looks elegant and feels well built. Now with the specs, the 8Mpx selfie camera is ok, nothing impressive with the photos, but is not bad at all, the 12Mpx triple camera is also ok, you can take pretty good photos in the right condition but the 3D scanning function is pretty awesome, with the right light you can make cool 3D models. The sound: meh… the stereo speakers is bad, not loud enough, but the dynamic vibration system is cool, but not to usefully unless you hold your phone while watching a video, if not, do not waste battery on that. There is not a headphone jack (if you are up to that) I don't really care, I usually use wireless headphones. The connectivity is great, not even a problem with that, Bluetooth, wifi, network and NFC works perfect. The battery is pretty good, is 3140mAh but last all day (if you like to play video games, it last around 8h), but for regular use is a pretty efficiency gadget For security, you can choose between a password, pin, finger print, pattern or face recognition, the finger print sensor is on the right side and is pretty comfortable to use and the face recognition can be improved scanning your face in different environments, light and styles. It is a good phone, if you want something that looks different and fancy you should totally get this phone.",1,"Sony"

I love the camera on this phone it has 3 cameras and takes beautiful pictures the low light photos aren’t as good as they could be but still an exceptional camera and I feel that the phone was well thought out and that Sony truly tried to take everything into consideration with the placement of the fingerprint on the side and the shape of the phone being slim yet still large enough to enjoy watching a movie on the screen made perfectly for smaller hands!

The voice recognition is also better than any phone I've ever used.",3,"Sony"
"3135","B07XF928ZP",5,"true","I previously had the Xperia 1 but returned it immediately, not due to the price but the fact that the Phone was just so big. I am really tired of Phones that are 6.5' and above because it defeats the purpose of a mobile phone and that is what the Xperia 1 was it barely fit into my pockets and you cannot use it in one hand. The Xperia 5 is the perfect size while keeping almost all of the features that the Xperia 1 has while also being cheaper. The price for this is well priced because for the iPhone 11 Pro you end up paying $1479 for 512 gb while here you pay $799 and then pay for the storage you need while keeping a great screen while having 3 amazing cameras. The previous reviewer got the product free while I did not and he is complaining about the phone while I could not even afford this phone but still paid $799 + tax and am still giving it a 5. I have tried the iPhone 11 Pro 512gb but returned that beacause I could not justify spending that much money on a Phone for it to become obsolete in a year and I am sick of the new market trying to get consumers to constantly pay monthly to the carrier to only not end up owning a phone but indefinitely just being at the carriers mercy, as a result I switched to Google Fi and this phone works perfect with it! Not only do you get a premium build but it works perfectly on the Google Fi network without paying for a Pixel which is not only overpriced but I also ended up returning that because the Build quality along with the specs and not even being water resistant was more money than the Xperia 1 which I despised because of the size. This size keeps the whole 21:9 CinemaWide while still keeping the whole concept of portability for half the price and allowing up to 640gb storage (512 gb micro sd + 128gb) and full Google Fi compatibility since it is available with every network! The camera on this is on par with the iPhone 11 Pro as well since it has all the same cameras and it keeps the whole concept of what Android is by keeping the bloat to a minimal where Samsung phones always force nothing but junk that cannot be removed unless you root the device. Also Xperia stays close to Google in terms of keeping up with the Android updates!",12,"Sony"

And the OLED display is beautiful.",3,"Sony"
"3137","B07XF928ZP",3,"false","I was quite excited to get the Xperia 5 especially since I know about Sony camera sensor prowess and the fact that the phone has 3 back cameras. I like photography and was hoping that this will allow me to leave my ""old-fashioned"" camera at home more often. BTW, I've reviewed the phone with a eye on how it compares with my Pixel 3a both for the phone and camera parts. But let me start with the ""phone"" part of the review. As a phone the Xperia is definitely nice. Thanks to the CPU/memory specs the phone is very responsive, snappier than the Pixel 3a. See the Antutu benchmark screenshot included with my review. The shape takes some getting used to as it's quite long and slender. Most of the apps that I use don't mind the unusual screen format but some do (mostly by ignoring the extra space at the bottom). The all glass body is very nice but very slippery especially with dry hands. I feel that it'll slip out of my hand at any moment. The fingerprint location is something new to me but it worked well for me with just about the average number of misdetections. I also like that it can be unlocked when placed flat on my desk (unlike phones that have the fingerprint sensor on the back). The screen is gorgeous and has deeper blacks than the Pixel 3a. Colors also seem to be quite accurate especially in Creator mode. The phone comes with a wired headset but sadly it's got a 3.5mm jack so you're forced to use the included USB-C dongle which is kind weird and ugly for an out-of-the-box experience. The headset is average in performance. One odd part that I noticed is that the Sony Support app pops a notification recommending that the phone be restarted every 7 days to ""maintain memory and performance"". While the camera flash is quite bright when using it as a flashlight it is woefully dim. Finally the built-in speakers were unexpectedly tinny and under-powered compared to the Pixel 3a ones. Also with the volume pumped up high there's a lot of vibration in the middle of the back of the phone even with the ""Dynamic Vibration"" off. Now for the camera part. Overall it's a good camera but I expected more coming from a Pixel 3a. I have two main complaints: usability and performance. On usability: 1. Switching between back cameras is cumbersome and sequential. You can't just pick the one you want. It can only be done in the 1x -> 2x -> w -> repeat order. And it takes a second or so for each step. 2. The normal mode of the camera has lots of options (eye detection, etc) that are on by default and can't be turned off. 3. The ""manual"" mode does offer nice controls but only applies to the 1x camera 4. The flash does not have an always-use mode. The closest is fill flash. 4. The wide camera does not have any flash or auto-focus. The lack of auto-focus is generally not an issue for such a wide angle lens but flash could come in handy. I hope that Sony can work on some of these shortcomings especially the software-only ones. On performance: I think that my copy of the main lens is a bit soft (or suffers from some focusing issues) as its images are often much softer than the pictures of the same shot that I get from the Pixel 3a camera. See the two pictures that I've included with my review. The telephoto (2x) lens takes sharp pictures with good saturation. The wide angle one is nearly as sharp and does take in a lot of scenery. You can adjust the images from the wide angle camera to correct the slight fisheye effect you get otherwise but you'll lose some width and detail. Exposure is also a bit more finicky in auto mode that on the Pixel 3a but in manual mode you can get it just right. The normal and (especially the) wide lens on the Xperia have shown more lens flare from either sun or indoor lights than the lens on the Pixel 3a. While it's somewhat expected for the wide lens I thought the normal one should have done a better job. Finally while the Xperia does not have the Night Sight of the Pixel 3a but still does a pretty good job in low light. All in all, I'm a bit disappointed with the camera's usability and think that the performance is OK. So, is this a great overall phone? Probably not, but it's a solid performer. I also expected the Xperia to have a more accurate white balance especially since it has a white balance sensor. It seems that the AI in the Pixel still has an edge.",NA,"Sony"
"3138","B081H6STQQ",4,"false","Pros:__________ • You’re buying this phone for the display. The 21:9 display dominates everything about this phone. With a 4k viewing, it’s the best cinema movie screen I’ve ever seen, in phone size. 21:9 is what you usually see in the movies. Under this display layout, the widescreen appearance is applied to the movies you’re watching on this phone. You won’t get any black bars on the top or bottom of the display (because of the 21:9 layout) as you’ll only get a full 4k image. No other phone does this and it’s the reason you’ll buy this one. • One other feature of the display is that gaming on this phone is really fun. The screen aspect ratio, and the Snapdragon 855 chip, makes gaming quite an experience. The screen is so large that your thumbs never get in the way of playing. • The design is very premium. All gorilla glass, front and back, while providing a narrow design. It’s not bulky or heavy, has curved metal edges, and overall a unique design from the rest of the smartphone crowd. • System-wise, the phone is fast and efficient like any other smartphone. Quick Bluetooth connectivity, fast internet connection, and the expected performance for the average daily user. • The button layout is perfect for those who are right-handed as the fingerprint scanner is on the side that provides convenient access to my thumb. • Because of the tall display, I found it efficient to be able to split the screen into two separate apps. This is the first phone that actually works well with this feature. • There are a couple of short cuts to be able to use this phone one-handed. The best one I think is, with the large display, just double tapping the home buttons will shrink the whole interface down so your thumb can reach anything that it couldn’t originally reach. This features a small perk, but it’s well made. • One juicy gift is Sony’s Cinema Pro app. This is a real beauty because it gives complete control on how you want to film with the camera. Color settings, stabilization, manual focus frames, brightness, saturation, and so on. This is such a cool app because you can modify the look of what you’ve filmed all on the phone. Filmmakers are going to love this if they’re on the go and need to do some color correcting. • Another awesome feature is Sony’s Creator Mode. When turning this feature on and watching “Stranger Things” with the Netflix app, the colors became much more accurate and vibrant than my past experience with the iPhone X. Note that this mode is softer on the eyes and displays less artificial tones. Honestly any movie you’re watching on this, you need to turn this on. • The camera system has great eye-tracking autofocus. When you get a group photo, you can see a little green box on the screen to let you know which person is focused. It works great and is very helpful for those who need to know if everyone is in focus. • Launching the camera is super quick as you have a button on the side for it. You just press and photo is taken. Quick and the photos are reliable. • Filming on this gives you a lot of options. You can record 21:9 content, to get that movie feel, alter key settings like white balance, resolution, shutter speed, color filter, etc. Overall, this is a phone with a hell of filming experience. • It does alright taking night photos for a phone that doesn’t have a dedicated night mode feature. It takes a little more time to shoot a pic, but that just means that the camera is gathering all the light it can before presenting your shot. Shooting on the sidewalk at 11 at night does give you solid results. • The charging on this phone is quick. Plugging it in, from 0 to 60%, took around 36 minutes. The system has a feature called Adaptive Charging where the phone regulates the charging speed if you leave your phone plugged in overnight. One of the killers in batteries is overcharging and this feature ensures that it won’t happen. Sony thinks ahead of longer-term battery health so my hats off to them. • The speakers are extremely loud and have great directional separation. • Water resistance. I didn’t test this one, but Sony states it. You might have to look at some videos to confirm if this is true. Cons and Oks:__________ • The Camera app is horrible. It’s slow to launch, to take shots and you have to swipe through the end of the app in order to switch from rear to front camera. It’s laborious, not user-friendly, and ruins the point of getting a casual capture as you have to dig around the app in order to take the picture that you want. Yes, you have a quick camera button on the side, but taking a shot really depends where you’re at, the number of peoples, the time, etc. You need to make sure the setting you want will fit the picture you’re taking. The app provides this but it’s poorly laid out. • The camera is decent but not as near as good in what you expect. In dull lighting, the images look flat and on clear sunny days, they looked a little washout. I do wish that the telephoto provided a little more zoom, and the wide angle lens is way too wide. It makes the picture look unnaturally stretched, like a fish-eye lens. • The selfie camera sucks. Without modifying it, it applies some of the most significant beauty filters I’ve seen in a camera. • There is no night mode. It does an alright job without this feature, but it’s not nearly as good in what you want a night picture to be. • No wireless charging. With a price this high, you expect this feature to be common sense. • No headphone jack. This is a movie phone and no headphone jack reduces the experience. You get a USB-C adapter that attaches to the phone’s charging port, but that’s one more thing to carry. • The speakers are loud but 80% of the clarity comes at the bottom speaker. In landscape mode, it’s easy to cover this speaker with your hand. Not the best in the arrangement. • The screen is too dim. Forget watching movies outside as even in max brightness it becomes a challenge to see what you’re watching, or filming. Another issue is when you’re using the camera, because of the screen’s low brightness, videos can be overexposed and you won’t be able to notice it. I found this out when transferring my shots to my computer and saw the significant brightness of my shots that my phone screen didn’t display enough. • Because of the design of this phone, it never sits in my front jeans properly and the narrow design always makes me feel that it can bend at any moment. It feels sturdy but, with a thin body, I assume bending this phone will be easy. • Not a great phone if you’re left handed as all the buttons (volume, fingerprint sensor, separate power button, and the camera button) are on the right side of the phone. • Kind of annoying that the fingerprint sensor and power button are not combined. You now have this extra button that adds a little more nuisance into the experience. • The nuisance grows even more when the fingerprint sensor isn’t even reliable. I had a lot of issues trying to get the sensor to recognize my fingerprint. Multiple times I’ve gotten the “Too many attempts” error to the point that I had to use my pin. The scanner isn’t reliable. • On the filming side you can’t use the flash to brighten your shot, the image stabilization needs to more effective, and there is no built-in editing software. This is a con because the whole point of this phone if the play movies and customize your viewing experience. If this is targeting filmmakers you expect this phone to come with some form of editing software. • Sony’s Side Sense feature is frustrating. I can never get this feature to work and when I don’t try it pops up. Software issues need to be made here. • Another annoying feature is having the phone vibrate in sync with the sound. This Dynamic Vibration vibrates with the music games you play. It does do well when you get a notification or a call, but watching a film isn’t a need for this. It takes you out of the moment if you’re watching something and suddenly vibrations come from your phone. Disable this feature. • The battery life is not great. With a 4k display, you’re going to sacrifice a decent amount of battery life. Around 8 hours of life, this includes watching a 90-minute video. You’ll get through the day with it but will have to charge it every day. • Only one SIM Slot • There is very little grip on this phone. Because of all-around glass design, it makes everything slippery. Simple vibrations on the phone will move the phone thanks to its smooth surface. Never place this on any edge without a case. • I have the 128GB and 20GB is already used out of the box. • A fingerprint magnet on every part of this phone. • There is bloatware of programs you’ll almost certainly never use. • Not all apps will match with the display. Just like a tablet, you’re going to get black bars running down either side of the screen if it doesn’t automatically resize. • The movie 21:9 experience is only for videos that are adapted to that. Most YouTube and sitcoms will not offer this feature. It’ll becomes a 4:3 or a 16:9 display, depending on your choice (like any other phone) Bottom Line:__________ It’s a movie phone, plain and simple. As I mention in the first pro, you’re getting this phone because of the display. A 4k screen viewing, that can provide you a 21:9 immersion, is a great experience if you’re in your bed or on an airplane. You get complete customization on how your display will look and with a narrow premium design, you’re bound to turn heads. I had a great time watching shows on this phone. Still, there are a lot of issues on the phone itself. The camera app, the dim lighting, and the fact that if you’re left-handed this phone is going to be a little more of an inconvenience. The reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because of the viewing experience of this phone when watching movies. Without the 21:9 feature this would’ve been a three-star layout. I can only hope software updates will resolve the numerous issues that have lower the value of what the phone is. For a price this high, you should stick with Sony Xperia 10 Plus until the bugs are fixed. Overall: A movie theater in your pocket but nothing more than that. Hope I was a help to you.

"3139","B081H6STQQ",5,"true","The Xperia XZ Premium was the best phone I've ever had, and I've had it for over 2 years. It still holds up to current flagships despite that. It had a 4k screen, which current flagships still don't have. And after 2 years, the battery is still at 97% original capacity even after very heavy use and quick-charging. That said, Sony has the best battery management software I've seen. Their batteries hold up better than Samsung over time, which is the #1 reason I switched brands. This phone is great. 4k HDR OLED screen looks brilliant. The best screen out there. The 21:9 aspect ratio is awesome, and the phone just feels sexy. The only complaint I had with the XZ Premium was the loudness of the speakers. I'm happy to say these speakers get very loud and sound great except at max volume, where they struggle with clarity. The fingerprint scanner is solid, but I wished they integrated the power button in the reader like the XZ Premium. I haven't played with the cameras too much yet. But from the quick launch and basic settings, it works great. I can't wait to try out the video recording. Sony did a good job with the software here, to. I hear people complain about side-sense on Youtube videos, but I honestly haven't had any issues. I made it a point to use it and now it's awesome. It just takes getting used to. The battery is big enough to last all day for 99% of people. I'm a heavy user and it gets me through the day. It's not as big as some competitors, which is something Sony could improve on. Also, no wireless charging. I have to dock the battery life a star because of its small size. But considering the actual lifespan of the batteries in Sony phones of the past, I give it an extra star.",28,"Sony"
"3140","B081H6STQQ",5,"true","This phone is quite beautiful. I upgraded from the XZ premium. The OLED screen is a nice upgrade and the each color is well lit in low light. The newly introduced Cinema Pro app with the 3 lens really is a seller. Pictures taken are really sharp and has a Cinema look to it. Other than that, not much has changed from the XZ Premium experience. Finger print sensor is really accurate and sensitive. It's also seperate from the power button, on the XZ they were the same button. Probably, my most liked feature is how fast the phone charges versus the the XZ. Expect the phone to be fully charged in an hour or less from 0%. The speakers are decent,not the loudest but loud enough to satisfy you in a low noise room. There is no headphone jack, sadly, but the phone does come with the adapter. Downsides: The screen is not too bright at 2/5 setting. I have to adjust the brightness settings to 55-65% just to achieve the same level of brightness as the XZ at 2/5 setting. Verdict: If you have an XZ Premium, you don't really need this upgrade. Unless you just want a phone with a very dedicated camera then... Drop that thousand dollar. I upgraded to this phone because my XZ broke on me.",8,"Sony"

"3142","B081H6STQQ",4,"true","12/2019 Updated camera and fingerprint scanner section after December SW update that brought Android 10 to Xperia 1. #Android 10 If Xperia 1 was fast on Pie, it now flies on Android 10. Full gesture navigation only works on Xperia Home launcher currently. System-wide dark theme is a good addition for the OLED screen, potentially saving some power though I do not notice much difference in battery duration. Sony also tuned the speakers, and voice/music now has a little more bass and depth. In other words, more similar to iOS devices. # Tall screen The unique form factor is not always better than others, but once you get used to it, there is no turning back. Watching 21:9 content is simply stunning, web browsing is a breeze, but playing 16:9 content the display area is only slightly bigger than the 5.2"" XZ1. I do not have issue using the phone under bright sunlight. The tall screen can be hard to use one-handed at first, but instead of getting my thumb twisted, I found I became more fluent and can use the phone one-handed most of the time. The key to this is Side Sense..... # Side Sense Most of the press reviews said that Side Sense (SS) is gimmicky and inconsistent. Well, I beg to differ. With some tweaks, I find SS to be quite useful. Sony claimed the default setting use AI to detect gesture. Unfortunately, I don't think it works well. Therefore, I changed the setting to: 1. Pin the sensing area to fixed location. For example, the middle section of each side of the screen. 2. Change swipe length to ""Short."" 3. Change transparency to make the sensing area visible. 4. Change swipe up to recent apps view. 5. Pin frequently-used apps in the popped up list. With the above setting, SS functions as navigation bar and makes one-hand use second nature most of the time. # Camera [Updated 12/2019] I came from XZ1 so the interface of the camera app is fine for me. The camera system on Xperia 1 can produce great images, but as of August firmware, does have its quirks and sometimes needs user’s intervention to get the best result. This makes Xperia 1 feels like a DSLR at times, and can be good and bad depending on your taste. Personally, I think the flexibility of the three cameras make the phone fun to use, and the great image quality that can be extracted out of the camera system makes it rewarding even though manual adjustment is occasionally needed. Among the three cameras, the main one has the best image quality. The sharpness is stunning and even across the frame. Color is artistic and has a great depth. The camera has a big sweet spot, and even in lower-lit scenes, the image quality holds on reasonably well. I have people asked me if the photos I took with Xperia 1 were from DSLR. No kidding, in the best circumstances, the images are that good. Telescope is a little bit softer and noisier. Color also does not have the same depth as the main camera, but at least the tone is similar. Telescope can at times hunt for focus, and needs switching to 1x and back to sort of reset the calculations. The wide-angle camera is the weakest in terms of dynamic range, I feel like only about 80-90% of the main camera. It also can show a different color profile than the other cameras, especially in low-light conditions. Thankfully, sharpness is similar to telescope lens. Even though the image quality is the weakest of the three cameras, the wide viewing angle opens up a lot of opportunities, and therefore is my favorite one. I am not a fan of portrait mode, which produces fake-bokeh, and Xperia 1 does not change my perception. The result is passable, but I can often spot imperfections when looking closely, especially when the background is complex. There are a few issues before September SW update e.g. video stabilization issue, slower processing. Those issue are mostly gone after September update. The December Android 10 update brought the camera app on par with Xperia 5, and I found the following improvements: - Digital zoom is significantly improved, at least for ratio <=2x. The photos are more than useable, and the reach is now effectively 4x. - Noise reduction seems slightly improved, as edges and textures look cleaner. The good thing about Xperia flagships is that Sony updates the firmware frequently. So hopefully future incremental improvements will still be brought to Xperia 1. # Fingerprint issue [Updated 12/2019] The FP scanner on Xperia 1 is known to be finicky, and can have FP recognition issue. Sony has tuned the scanner several times along the monthly SW updates, but the issue is never fully resolved. People worked around the issue by adding several entries for the same finger, and usually this improved the recognition rate to an acceptable level. After moving to Android 10, I re-scanned my FP and alas, the recognition rate is almost 100%! Maybe something was changed in Android 10, but I doubt it because I have another FP (that has only one entry) that still has low recognition rate. # Conclusion The phone is... special. It is a phone you buy with your right-brain. It is a phone you need to use it in person to appreciate (or hate). It has some quirks, and image quality is still not as good as the best in fully automated mode. But at the end of the day does it matter? When the phone works (and it works well most of the time), it feels convincing. So it is a phone worth trying, but be prepared, the ride can be bumpy depending on your preference and taste.",20,"Sony"

"3165","B081H6STQQ",4,"false","Hi there, So I will be reviewing this Phone and I am very excited to do so. I am a LOYAL iPhone user and I've never ever tried anything else before. I've been using iPhone 6 s plus for 4 years now and I just felt like I needed to try something new. I really care about Picture Quality and Video quality, and iPhone had never disappointed me when it came to taking pictures ( When the lightning was right) So lets go ahead and review this Phone ( Quick Disclaimer this will be my first impression review because I don't have this phone for that long but I will update my review after a couple of weeks) DESIGN WOW. This Phone looks so Tall and unique, I don't think that I've ever seen a phone before with a 16:9 Ratio. Even tho it is so tall it fits comfortably in my hands and I don't feel like I am overwhelmed by its size. It's pure Black, very slim, light and super elegant with a glossy finish both sides. It has 3 bottoms only on the right side and 1 Fingerprint scanner which is on the Right side too (Impressive) From Top to Bottom: + -, Fingerprint scanner, On-Off Bottom, and an extra Camera- Buttom to take Pictures. On the backside, you will find 3 Cameras 26 mm, 52 mm, 16mm. I tested a couple of things compared to my iPhone 6s Plus and I need to admit that Sony Xperia is not that Bad. Sound quality - iPhone More Bass, Sony Xperia Louder Sharper Sound video quality ( Watching Youtube OR Movie Trailer) Both Great but Sony Xperia is better for one because of the Screen length and for two the loud sound quality and for 3 it has a Dynamic Sound Vibration which makes it even better. CAMERA one of the most important things to me, I haven't tried the camera in different lighting but from my first impression, I feel like it did a pretty good job! I uploaded a picture for you to see both Pictures Quality in the same lightning, I feel like you get more color out of the Picture with the Sony Xperia. I also took. a picture from my Window and its pretty sharp. One great fact is that it automatically takes pictures JUST BEFORE you press the shutter key at the right moment. And you can save the ones you like the best. The Camera as 1644 pixel by 8840. So it says that it shoots 4K videos but I haven't tried that yet. The front camera is not the BEST but I feel like a lot of font cameras are not really the BEST BEST BEST. But dont get me wrong it's still good! COOL FACTS ABOUT THIS PHONE - Water Resistance - Quick Rinse, etc. - Split Screen App use two apps at the Same Time - Made out of Gorilla Glass - Battery last longer! Charged it only once in 1-2 Days - 6.5 INCH Screen - COOL APPS Pre-installed like Movie Editor, 3D Scan scan your face or other objects, Cinema Pro, Netflix, Fortnite, PS App, Movie Creator, Games. - Side Sensor CONCLUSION I really like this Phone, I never thought that I would ever take a look at Andriod, etc, But this Phone is really good and I feel like I can take Great Pictures with it. YES, it is expensive, I wouldn't price it that High but it has a lot of features that are good to use. Phone Design is very luxurious looking and screen quality is very Sharp and Clean. The camera has 12 MP and a Wide Ankle. It's a great phone! Why not try something New? 8.9 Stars from 10",14,"Sony"
"3166","B081H6STQQ",2,"false","say what you want, Sony makes the best Android phones on the market. I'm currently using the XZ2 Premium, and I absolutely love the camera on that phone, and aside from the weight of the XZ2P, thickness, all is good. So, when I found out the Xperia 1 was coming out to replace the XZ2P, I was really excited, and got it today. I couldn't be more disappointed. The screen display quality is absolutely unmatched, but the form factor is just not working. The screen in length is too long in ratio, in comparison to the width. and the width is so narrow that if you rotated the screen, the keyboard takes up almost the entire screen, making it not useable at all. The width is also at a point, in between full grip, or one-hand grip, making it something to get use to. I've never felt this on any of Sony's past flagship, except this one, strange. The side sense is also not working well, I can't control when it wants to work, and so I don't even try to make it come up anymore. I'm not sure the three lens camera is better in picture taking than the XZ2P, as that is the best low-light camera on a smartphone yet. Even though Sony went 3 lens, wide, med, and tele, I still prefer the XZ2P and the higher mega pixel count + stunning picture taking capability. The camera on the XZ2P is noticeably better than on the XZ Premium. The fingerprint sensor is just not working intuitively anymore, once you're used to the XZ2P on the back. I know a lot of reviewers nitpicked that location, but I do believe it's the better location in comparison. The main reason I gave this a 2 star, is because of one major flaw. Remember when Apple had the problems with the Iphone 4 with the antenna strips embedded into the side edge of the phone, both bluetooth, cell, gps, etc.... well, starting with the XZ2 generation, and the major complaint I have of the XZ2P, and also the reason buying the Xperia 1 is so I can get better reception. But the Xperia 1 is as bad as the XZ2 series, if not worse, and that is unforgivable in 2019 pushing 5G. A primary function of a phone is to be able to make calls, and this may also be a problem with carriers not having decent coverage, but being in the middle of Southern California having this problem in 2019 is just plain sad. But the XZ2 series and the Xperia 1 has weak antenna strength in comparison to the XZ Premium generation, by a noticeable margin. And this isn't just cell reception, it's wifi, and gps as well. Bluetooth I haven't noticed much, but I bet it's probably not as strong either. Sony needs to go back to their original way of doing antennas, PLEASE. I'm not buying anymore $1000 Sony phones until they fix this problem. I understand we want phones to look nice, but not at the expense of signal strength performance....... enough said. Xperia 1 is going back to Sony. I'm not spending $1000 to have bad signal strength.",8,"Sony"
"3167","B081H6STQQ",3,"false","Unboxing: The unboxing is straightforward; just opening the box the phone is presented to you, underneath which are some documents, a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack as well as some headphones. You'll likely want a separate case. There is also an 18 watt charger with a short USB-C to USB-C cable. There is a sticker on the phone advertising the side sense function which is where you tap the phone twice on the little side bezel for one handed mode. Setup: This phone is really quick to set up, requiring only your google account to be fully usable. Coming from iOS, it does take time to get used to the operating system, and after a week it is easy to use like any other smartphone. Design: The phone is built solidly. It won’t flex at all during normal use or bend testing. Both the front and back are covered in Gorilla glass 6, although despite this, it is possible to scratch it so I’d recommend a screen protector and case/skin. The camera hump on the back houses three 12 MP cameras, one normal, wide angle, and one telephoto. It isn’t flush with the back so the phone will rise a little on a flat surface. The somewhat small and dim flashlight is placed above the camera module. Also on the back is the NFC making it easy to connect to NFC enabled devices. There is a slight bit of branding on the back in dark grey text saying Sony and lower down the phone ‘XPERIA’. At the top of the phone there is SIM card tray which also has a micro SD card slot and does not require a sim tray tool to open. At the bottom there is a USB-C charging port as well as a mediocre speaker to the right. There is a total of 3 buttons and a fingerprint sensor all on the right side. It would’ve been nice to have the volume rocker on the left side to declutter the right. One of the three buttons is a shutter button, which like real DSLR cameras has a little half press focus button which is pretty neat and useful. There is a problem with a side mounted fingerprint sensor: you can use it easily only while holding the phone in your hand. At this price point I think that Sony should’ve put an in display finger print reader but I guess I’d be wishing at this point. The reader works well as long as your finger is in the right position, and at its quickest it matches Face ID in unlock speed. The earpiece at the top is recessed compared to the screen so stuff can be trapped inside; if you have tweezers you can clean it out but be careful. It would’ve been nice to have a little mesh grate covering it to lower the chances of stuff getting inside of the earpiece. There is a small forehead and chin bezel with a very small side bezel running the whole 6.5 inches of the phone. Inside the top bezel on the left side there is a little status LED which is on for charging and can be customized as to when or if you want it to light up. The phone is actually massive, length wise, easily beating an XS max with a case on. Width wise its shorter allowing for the 21:9 screen ratio perfect for watching movies. Something worth noting is that the phone is water resistant to IP65/68. The phone comes in 4 colors: black, purple, grey, and white. Personally, for a little more color I’d go for purple, but black has a very attractive stealthy appearance. Usability: This phone uses the newest snapdragon processor, the 855 which runs in tandem with Sony’s own gpu, a scaled down X1 chip, the same used in their OLED TV line up such as the A1E. It runs android 9 pie and is relatively free of bloatware, ignoring Sony’s ‘cinema pro’ and ‘movie creator’. Despite the power, the battery runs all day long and I still have 30% battery after a full day of use. Multitasking is actually somewhat useful and makes me wish I had it on my iPhone. It has one app over the other, although a lot of my apps don’t seem to support this feature, but the ones that do work perfectly. The previously mentioned micro SD card slot supports an extra 512 gb of expansion, plus the included 128gb of storage making this phone perfect for storing high quality photos and a ton of music and apps. Screen: The screen is probably the biggest reason as to why you’d buy this phone, and it does not disappoint. It is a glossy 21:9 6.5inch 4k HDR OLED screen which has 100% of the P3 color range with 10 bit color. This is the best screen I’ve ever seen on a phone and is the best thing about it. The screen is about 655 nits, compared to the 725 nits of the Xs max. This is currently the best phone screen period. Camera: The front facing camera at just 8MP isn’t great and lacks detail. In well lit situations it works okay but in dark forget about it. The back cameras are better but are not without their faults. The main shooter on the back is okay but the brightness is very dark, and once again the details are hard to make out when compared to the iPhone XS Max. The wide-angle lens is probably the most useful out of the three and is something again I wish I had on my iPhone. It is very clear and allows for easier to take group photos. The telephoto lens also suffers from the same quality and detail loss as the main shooter. When zoomed all the way (10x) quality goes out of the window and is simply just a zoom with little detail. Honestly for a $1000 phone from Sony, a brand known for their cameras among other things, I would expect much better cameras for this price point. Problems- The cameras were certainly a disappointment, but so was the sound. The speakers are muffled and tiny, and just don’t reach the volume that you would expect. Don’t let the Dolby Atmos certification fool you here, this is still a phone. And when compared to my iPhone, the difference is very noticeable and should not be a reason to purchase this phone. The bluetooth is only 4.2 as opposed to 5 which has been out for a while now and the range for whatever reason is incredibly small. Overall, this phone feels like a concept, a great idea but with some poorly executed features. If you really need a 4k screen on your phone I guess go on and get it, but there are just too many flaws, especially in a phone of this price range. If you want android I’d recommend getting a Samsung Galaxy s10+ but if not, get an iPhone XS Max as it just has a better OS and more features.",5,"Sony"
"3168","B081H6STQQ",4,"false","As a Apple fangirl (IPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac) I honestly thought no android could change my mind, however the Sony Experia 1 has made me question everything. My previous android experience came from 4 years ago with the galaxy s8 active and note and I had so many issues with glitchy technology I swore them away for good, or so I thought. -The 21:9 aspect ratio does take some time to adjust to, it’s very funny to look at however it’s very comfortable to hold. The 4K HDR OLED display is absolutely breathtaking and I prefer it to the display on my IPhone X. The long screen also allows for multitasking 2 apps (one on top, one on bottom) and it feels natural and doesn’t feel like you sacrifice much to use it comfortably. - Rear facing cameras take great quality photos, however the front facing camera could have so improvements. It does have several fun filters included in the stock camera app that are cute and work great. - All buttons are located on the right side (including volume rocker, fingerprint sensor, power button and dedicated camera button) they are all easily reached with your right thumb when holding however it may be an issue with anyone who holds the phone with their left hand. - Side Sense technology (where you double tap the side of the screen to open a favorites menu) doesn’t seem to work when you want it to but you always activate it on accident. - Fingerprint sensor works excellent without any issue. The Main Cons - NO wireless charging, I definitely feel like all flagship smartphones need wireless charging at this point and the fact that we don’t have it on the Experia 1 is a major disappointment. - SO SLIPPERY, I know pretty much all phones are made of glass now and they are inevitably going to be slippery but Sony takes it to a completely other level, using this phone without a case just seems like an accident waiting to happen. It slides on every surface and has fallen off my couch many times (but has held up great). -Expect issues if using Verizon. I consider myself great with technology but after being unable to receive texts from anyone (and googling every possible fix with no help) I was forced to call customer support. After about 30-45 minutes and speaking with a tier 2 technician they were able to fix the problem, but this was a major headache that probably would have caused me to return the phone had I purchased it. Sony or Verizon or whoever the issue was caused by definitely need to address this issue immediately (I read another review where an individual had the same issue and it wasn’t fixed.)",3,"Sony"
"3169","B081H6STQQ",5,"false","The 4K 21: 9 Cinema Wide display is just phenomenal and with the 6.5"" height you have more information on the screen than ever before. Meaning better productivity because you're not wasting time scrolling and searching - it's all right there in front of you. The display is the most important part of the phone because it's what you interact with and that alone is what makes this phone better. Just simply going through setup menus I noticed there were less steps simply because there is so much more on the screen. The text and fonts are just crisp and easier to read than other displays. Though like most phones it's a bit difficult to read in the direct sunlight. Qualcomm's snapdragon 855 Processor seems powerful enough and fast for the mobile computer with a phone and camera app that this Sony Xperia 1 really is. Sound is rich with plenty of amplification to hear without a headset. The mobile was intuitive enough to ask and transfer all my contacts and apps as soon as it was powered up with a new SIM, so anyone can do it without reading a manual or asking a tech. Only Sony would have this tip top Cinema Pro 4k video recorder that is has more settings than my action camera. With a 512Gb micro SD I should be able to make some decent length movies. The 3 lens camera is far more than adequate for me, and much better than my last two phones. Easy phone to hold because it is narrow enough at the width for the average size hands to grip well. I have large hands so I prefer the grip with the extra width added by the case which makes it fit my hand better. I hate to put a case on such a beautiful phone, but I'm too clumsy not to use one. More intuitive controls with the thumb print reader on the side where you grasp the phone and there is single hand side intuitive controls. Look the phone is gorgeous with the top display, top processor, a 3-lens camera with good movie creation capability. Yes, I definitely recommend this phone if your in the market and want the top display today.",3,"Sony"
"3170","B081H6STQQ",4,"false","The Sony Xperia 1 is a stunning smartphone. It comes in a beautiful, near bezel-less frame with a 6.5 inch screen and a unique 21:9 aspect ratio. It features a 4K OLED screen and quality speakers for an optimal movie-watching experience. However, it lacks a 3.5mm audio jack, so you will need either Bluetooth headphones or a headphone jack to USB-C dongle. It comes pre-loaded with Android Pie (v9.0) out of the box. The Xperia 1 has 6 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of internal storage, which can be expanded with a micro-SD card. It also features a 12 megapixel camera with three lenses for zoom and low-level light situations. The 6GB RAM makes the Xperia 1 great for gaming; I have yet to experience any lag or slowdown while playing, and the phone rarely heats up while in use. The camera is specially designed for recording video, and comes with an onboard video editor. Streaming movies is great with the 21:9 aspect ratio, but when streaming YouTube or other videos, you will experience some letterboxing while watching. Videos shot in the usual 16:9 ratio will leave black bars on either end of your screen. It's tolerable, but watching videos in the 4:3 ratio will leave nearly half of the screen unused. Although the Xperia 1 is tall, it still feels great to hold, even with one hand. There are several tap and swipe gestures implemented to make operating the phone easier with one hand. The battery life is about average. You can expect about 4-5 hours of straight, screen-on use, or a day's worth of normal usage. The USB-C connector allows for quick charging. You can get a full charge in less than 2 hours. The only nitpicks I have with the phone is that the screen does not get very bright, and that the phone automatically restarts every time the SIM card is inserted or removed. Overall, I really like the Sony Xperia 1 and would recommend it to others. It may not be for everyone, but it's a solid smartphone that is great for watching movies. Rating: 4/5 stars",3,"Sony"
"3171","B081H6STQQ",3,"false","Final Update: I ended up ordering another Samsung Galaxy.. Why? Many items this phone will not blue tooth connect, the main thing being my car stereo and my Sony headphones. It also would not connect to my blue tooth speaker system at home, my mini speaker system, and other items. Also, the phone is missing the earphone jack. Finally, many carriers don't support SONY phones. I was going to change carriers and was going to have to buy another phone because they do not support Sony phones. What will I miss about this phone? It charges fully in about an hour. The size is like a regular house phone. The phone is not fragile, many nights I lay on top of it while it is charging. It is just cool to have a phone not everybody has. The 3* rating is because the phone will not Bluetooth connect to SONY products. My car stereo is Sony and my main headphones are Sony. It will not Bluetooth connect to these items. It does Bluetooth connect to Alltel. You can use regular headphones with the adapter to connect. Do I recommend this phone? No, because tho sleek, it is a pain in the a.........s........s to own. Also, it will not Bluetooth connect to Sony products. How weird is that? …….......... Original review below was online getting ready to buy the latest Samsung ; an upgrade from the S7 when (coincidentally: wink, wink) Amazon asked me if I wanted to try out a phone. I really was hesitate. The last two phones I reviewed were knock offs of name brands and I was very upset that I had gotten rid of my good phone for the reviewed phone. FFd to the Xperia and it is actually a HIGH END phone. It is sleek (Pretty), as big as a house phone so you really feel like you are on your phone and not a calculator, and it comes LOADED. This phone retails for $949.00. I personally always buy my phones off e6ay so I can't say I would pay that, but for folks that buy the I9hone and other high end phones this is definitely worth it. Great pictures, clean and crisp, and quick. My prepaid data had slowed down and you could tell with the S7; it is not as noticeable with this phone. Do I recommend? YES; if you are ANTI-apple like I am then consider this phone along with a Samsung. P.S., the phone came charged two weeks ago and when I went to the T-Mobile store for the transfer, it still had 13%. My S7 is always drained down to zero. The reviewed phone just comes with the charging cable; no headphones. You MUST have the charging cable; it is much bigger than the old Android charging cable. It is the C cord. Cons: The phone is too big to use one handed. The screen can be reduced to one handed use in the settings. Once I get a case I will try it out. Without a case, the phone is too long and slippery. 2. It is hard to fit in a small purse. 3. You probably will have to wait on running band holders and other special holders since it is so long. 4. Someone said it does not have a headphone jack. I will have to check on this. Because it is so slippery, I taped it in the carton it came in. Once the case arrives, I will be able to test out more features Update 1:the Bluetooth will not connect to your car stereo. Bluetooth issues are common google search issues. I may have to go back to my s7. I listen to videos via Bluetooth everyday in my car and need Bluetooth. 2. The adapter for the earphone jack goes in the charging port. Basically, you can't use the phone jack and charge at the same time 3. My USB in the car just goes to ringtones. I can't get YouTube videos to play using USB with the phone 4. To stop the phone from vibrating with music, you press the volume button and dynamic vibration will appear",2,"Sony"
"3172","B081H6STQQ",4,"false","This phone looked so nice and is larger than my current phone. I wanted to keep it for myself but I decided to give it to my son because the phone he had was older than mine and this one looked like a good phone to use for playing games, which I don't do. His words: Sound quality: The sound from the phone is acceptable. The phone is best used with a Bluetooth speaker or headphones which was perfect for me because I hate wires. The phone does not have an audio jack however, came with the required cable to use a pair of wired headphones and a set of headphones. Video quality: Sony stated they produced the first phone with a display 4K HDR OLED CinemaWide Display and lived up to it's promise with amazing video quality. I've watched a lot of movies on YouTube and other online channels and the footage looks fantastic. I've also downloaded a few games that look great; I would suggest getting a controller to connect to the phone to make game play easier. The length is good but my your thumbs may still block the screen. Design: The phone is slim which feels great in my hands yet very long. It has a very appealing aesthetic but can be cumbersome to hold and manage some functions like texting or making a call. My phone came in black which looks great. I'm sure the other color options of purple and white look amazing as well. The phone is also very light; when I first opened the box I thought it would be heavier. Camera: The camera takes really good pictures and the video quality is excellent also. I've taken a few shots inside and out with very little distortion in photos or video from light however, I have yet to try it at night. Storage: The phone comes with 128GB of space. I really have no clue how I'll use that much space but I'll probably fill it with movies and games. The phone comes with apps that assist video and photo alteration which are good. It also has additional assistance apps for managing any games that you may download which is a nice bonus. Cons: The only downside for me was having Google pushed on me at every turn while activating my phone. It's a simple push of a button to opt out however, on a unlocked phone I would think it would come up less. There are also a view other features of the phone like ""side sense""and other others I don't have a use for. The phone does not provide the ability to turn off these functions or notifications which is a negative. Also all of the buttons for the phone are on the right hand side of the phone. It takes some getting used to to not accidentally hit a button. Due to some of the cons I would also bring the price down a bit closer to the 750-800 range; the last time I checked it was somewhere between 949 to 1,000. Overall: I would give this phone a 4.5 out 5. There are a few cons but they are so small and very easy to overlook. It's an amazing phone that I'm thankful to have. I would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a new phone.",1,"Sony"
"3173","B081H6STQQ",4,"false","Let me start off this review by saying the Sony Xperia 1 is not compatible with the Sprint network which is super disappointing. Sprint couldn’t give me a timeline or any info on when or if it will ever be compatible in the future. I currently have an iPhone XS Max so I will compare it to that. I found this phone to be much thinner then the XS Max but it is also taller. I’m actually amazed by how paper thin it is. It’s easier to grip in your hand then the XS Max. Right out of the box the touch screen is super sensitive, no need to calibrate. The graphics and colors are phenomenal. Much clearer and crisper then my iPhone XS Max. Perfect for watching movies or playing games. It does take longer then my iPhone to reach a full charge BUT the battery does last longer which is another plus for the Xperia. Overall it’s a excellent phone. In some ways it’s better then my iPhone. They are definitely giving iPhone a run for its money!",1,"Sony"
"3174","B081H6STQQ",3,"false","I really wanted to like this phone, but it’s been so buggy and glitchy that I’ve been miserable using it. I’ve had my service connected to it for three weeks and I’ve had more issues than I ever did with my iPhone. The screen is absolutely stunning and the photo quality is superb. The fingerprint ID never has any issues. I mainly find issues when opening apps I run very frequently- my son’s monitor app and a few smart home devices I use. These apps are vital to my daily life so until the phone is more compatible with common iOS apps, I will be sticking with my iPhone.",1,"Sony"

"3181","B081H6STQQ",1,"true","update Nov 4, 2019 This phone is crap if you are a tmobile customer. I have been with them for 11 years and the Xperia 1 is driving me nuts considering that I paid $1040 for the newest of the new that they (sony) said would work on Tmobile. TMo also said that it is compatible with some but not all of the bands that they use for LTE and 4g. I cannot stand this PHONE. The phone does not work well, nor does the GPS. After months of traveling by driving 10K plus miles across this USA I can say that this phone is crap on T-Mobile if rated by it's modem alone. My friend has an Iphone 8 and it outperforms this CRAPIERA tenfold with connectivity to cellular, wifi and GPS. I lost signal more times than I care to count while driving across the country. It doesn't matter if I was in Den, Mem, Raliegh, Nashville, NOLA, Shreveport, DFW or on the roads between those cities, this phone has spotty cellular and GPS signal everywhere I have been and in between too. I rely on Google GPS daily and especially while traveling outside of state. It lost the GPS signal so many times. As a comparison I drove from San Antonio Texas to Vegas using my XPERIA Z3, thats android 5.02 in January. Not once did i lose GPS (no audible notification) or the ability to make a phone call (that i noticed). I cant use my phone as a phone and cant use it for GPS because they are not reliable. My travel buddies iphone 8 never lost GPS or the ability to make phone calls, not once, where this Sony did so constantly. The ""GPS SIGNAL LOST"" alert blasts through the car stereo which becomes so much more annoying with each continuous notification) I have traveled a lot since getting the Craperia 1 in July and only now (Nov) have I been able to call TMobile to try to sort things out. Well it turns out that this phone was not designed to work with all of TMos preferred frequency bands. It is set up to work on 3G primarily, being the 1900mhz Frequency in particular. The problem is that TMo and the other majoy carriers are shifting their signals to to a frequency range that is much much lower in the 600MHz (Band 71) & the 700MHz (Band 12) range. If i were near anywhere nearby to a TMo antenna/Tower I would likely experience wonderful service even though it is outdated and currently being replaced. The problem is that I have always had borderline issues with obtaining a strong signal be it LTE or 4G on any of my previous phones while at my house. That is why they (TMo) gave me a cell spot for use at my house. Had i known this phone wasn't fully compatible with TMobiles network I would have not even considered buying it. Frustratingly even after the restore that it was suggested I do today I am still not able to have a steady conversation while on wifi. I really only decided to do the reset because of all of the below issues that I am also having. I did it in hopes of repairing those issues and hopefully helping with my connectivity. time will tell with the below isssues but as for the connectivity over cellular, NO DICE! it still performs horribly while on a phone call. I'm going to waste more of my time now trying to figure out why it doesn't work well on WiFi either. I dont know if this is an Andriod Pie thing or Sony but you can no longer LOCK a text from being deleted. The phone has died over night causing me to miss my alarm because for whatever reason it does not want to go to sleep all of the time. I have to manually put it to sleep every time. I can't just expect it to do as I told it to in the sleep settings. I cannot send texts immediately. Memes, Pictures and longer texts take sometimes HOURS to be sent. Whether on wifi or not. - probably has to do with the incompatibility with TMos networks You cant see the phone while outdoors. it just wont get bright enough and just when you think it is bright enough you will get a message saying that it is about to overheat so please turn it back down. Some will say to use the adaptive brightness or custom feature. Neither of them fix the problem and I bet that those same people live somewhere other than where it gets above 90 degrees frequently and probably work indoors. I So much for Cinema Pro, You cant use it unless you are indoors or it is a cloudy day. THIS PHONE SUCKS! I WANT MY MONEY BACK DO NOT BUY they cant fix the message icon issue where it constantly displays that there is a text message.. They can't fix the issue with not being able to Click on an address or phone number in a text and get a pop up with options. The screen just flashes. They tell you to delete the messaging apps cache and whatever to fix the problem. It will then work for an unknown amount of time before it reverts back to not working again. Daily i have to fix this. The speaker near the bottom of the phone is like 7 times louder than the one by the earpiece and it has much of the EQ range that it needed for clarity in speech. A lot of the sound effects are in stereo so if you have one of the two speakers covered you are going to be missing out on half of the audio. The earpiece speaker and the one by the bottom are not tuned the same. The moment you cover that speaker with either you hand while in landscape or while sitting it on your belly to rest while viewing its in a vertical position you will notice a SIGNIFICANT drop in the volume as the speaker is now blocked and the one by the earpiece is weaker in volume in comparison. The audio then becomes unintelligible. I'm probably going to return it for another one here REAL QUICK because of the following charging issue: (update I couldn't return it because it took ONE spill and chipped the black finish off the frame) Great design Sony! I have had the phone for 9 days. Last night while i was in bed reading and charging the phone began to cycle through charging and not charging with the slightest of movement from the cable. I cannot emphasize ""slightest"" enough. This happened a good 8 times in less than a minutes before i finally said screw it and unplugged the phone to continue reading without being disturbed by its cycling and notifications. Today i let it die all the way and plugged it in to fully charge it. Yes, this phone charges like no other I have ever owned or seen before. It absolutely blows my mind with how quickly it does the job. I was away from it for thirty minutes and when i returned i noticed that the LED was not illuminated as it should be while charging. I wiggled the phone and got nada. I then tapped the power button to see where the charge was at and to my surprise it began to power on (so i thought) but was actually just acknowledging that it had been plugged in to charge which it then began doing so. I Cant use the phone while it is chargning without disturbances unless it is in a completely static position. Do I have to check it once i plug it in to make sure the USB-C is seated correctly 9 days out of the box? Yes, it is very slippery so get a case for it. Dont buy the $12.99 Tyrain ones from Amazon labeled ""smooth"" red, blue etc. They are **bleep** for cases because they barely cover maybe 60% of the phones edges, besides being equally slippery. Dont buy the sony style cover for it either. I got the white one. Its not white any more after used some cream on my face and then grabbed my phone. The white case is now all rusted in color, even the clear plastic spine/face cover has become discolored. Ok, so I'll bite the bullet on that one... whatever but that doesn't explain why the plastic cover/face is falling apart two months after purchase (it was $60 from the UK) two of the corners on the ""lid"" are pealing back and have become sharp and frayed. I did nothing to start its demise. yet Sony has a no warranty on accessories policy.. not even for lifelong customers. While watching videos on FB with the volume at one level, say max, and then a commercial takes place, when it returns to the video the volume is significantly lowered with no ability to return it to a higher level. No clue if this is Android 9.0, Xperia 1 or FB but it really sux. This only happens while using the phone speakers, not while on Bluetooth. headphones While watching videos on FB in vertical mode the volume will be at one level but when you switch to landscape mode it will again lower to something less than where it had been with no way of returning to the previous volume besides rotating the screen to a vertical position. I am an airhead and later figured out that this is because the lower speaker is 7 times louder than the one by the ear. Once you cover it up or hinder its output in any way you will notice a significant loss in volume / clarity. I got this phone because I love the Xperia line, period. I didn't get it to play games primarily though the remote PS4 play option was definitely a selling point for me. I haven't played any games that way just yet though i have played PUBG and Fortnite. Both have frozen while loading the games. The phone wont do anything until I manually close the game. hmpf. I'll reset the setting to 30fps and see if that helps as I am currently on 60fps.. you know, the ones they bloated about being so awesome. smh While playing PUBG yesterday the navigation bar started popping up and not hiding, preventing me from seeing a portion of the screen and subsequently screwing with my game-play because i couldn't access some of the game features. I had to rotate the phone 180 degrees to get to those functions. When i did so the nav bar just went to the other end of the phone. It displayed the LOCK symbol, as it should since thats how i set it up for game-play. It had worked flawlessly for the day or so prior when I had played, but not this time. Youre supposed to tap the lock and then the nav bar functions would be visible and available for usage. I couldn't unlock it while it was on either side of the phone to use the NAV bar to save my life so I ended up having to restart the phone. I keep getting texts, reading them and then the Text logo continues to display that I have (x) amount of texts, until i restarted the phone. Sony and Android do not care to fix this and there is no known repair other than to manually delete the cache in the messaging app daily. I am with T Mobile and have Visual Voicemail. I have so far gotten three system notifications that I will have to manually sync my VM. I haven't gotten any voicemails since installing the app so I cant say whether or not it is functioning properly anyways. I can say that the system keeps showing me the standard VM notification icon at the top of the phone which is weird since I haven't gotten a single voicemail since installing the app. I just upgraded from the Xperia Z3 (yes it lasted this long) and on that Android version, 5.02, i was able to override the stock VM notification when i installed the Visual VM from TMo so that i wasn't getting duplicate notifications. I have not seen that option on this build. - three months later I tried to use it and the same issue was occurring numerous times a day. TMo visual VM app on the Play store is smothered with complaints about this same issue. I called Tmo and they said that it is a patching issue that they have been made aware of but that it is an Android fix that is needing to be done for it to work properly. I have deleted the app again until further notice from Tmo It really isnt that bright of a phone while outdoors. I knew that going in but didn't know how bad it really was until i started using it outside. I love how fast it is and how comfortable in the hand it is. every time you brighten the screen to 100% you will get a notification about how prolonged usage at that brightness level could damage the screen. It pops up EVERY TIME and there is no way to make it not appear again. Too bad that I have to turn the screen up all the way to see the damn phone while outdoors. what the hell were they thinking when they designed this POS? if you work outdoors, BUY A DIFFERENT PHONE. As for the fingerprint reader and facial recognition I am pretty happy with them both. it may take a time or two every now and then but for the most part they make access simpler more often than not. - update three months later. I take back what I said about both the facial and fingerprint options as they are both CRAP crap CRAP! I work in the dark a lot or I am inside without perfect lighting so the facial recognition doesn't always see my face. I get it. But my fingerprint doesn't change. I have 4 fingerprints saved and more often than not I find myself saying screw it and going for the manual log in because the scanner wont recognize a single one of them. 60 days later. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, IT IS NOT RELIABLE. CAN'T SEE IT WHILE OUTSIDE ON A SUNNY DAY. CAN'T USE THE CAMERA BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THINGS AND BESIDES THAT IT OVER HEATS, OVER HEATS AND OVER HEATS ALL WHILE DOING NOTHING. I live in Texas. This phone was not designed to withstand our hot sunny days. SONY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ITS MOBILE CUSTOMERS. I'M ON MY 10TH XPERIA IN 7 YEARS. THE OTHERS WERE BETTER BY MEANS OF BUGS AND FLUID USAGE.

"3182","B081H6STQQ",5,"true","All the manufacturer's make great phones, so picking a top tier phone is purely a subjective affair at this point. I'm not a fan of curved screens, in screen or back of the phone fingerprint readers, I don't use wireless charging. My last phone was a Sony Xperia XZs which I had for over 2 years, it is the same width and depth as the Xperia 1, the Xperia 1 is decidedly taller. I have also owned Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G6 phones, I prefer Sony's design language (purely subjective). Screen: Majestic, incredible. The 21:9 aspect ratio is a huge upgrade, you fit so much more onto the screen, very good for productivity. Fingerprint reader: Solid, my favorite style which is on the side of the phone. Occasionally I need to do 2 attempts, I think the XZs was slightly more reliable. Camera: Initial reports are good. I really liked my camera on my XZs although it suffered in lowlight, but it shot great video. From what I have seen in 2 days the Xperia 1 has better detail and the 3 shooting modes are a welcome addition. Battery: Would have been nice if it was bigger, but phone has lasted without a hitch for full day usage thus far with around 50% left at night. Size: I was never a fan of huge phones, and while this phone is tall it is narrow enough to be a joy to use and hold. Speakers: My XZs had a terrible speakerphone function, the Xperia 1 has great speakers, nice clarity, and they're loud. Overall: Fantastic phone.

"3183","B081H6STQQ",5,"true","Coming from sony xperia XZ Premium is a nice upgrade in my opinion. the camera is one of the best when you know how to take picture in manual mode. auto mode is more of a hit or miss but i take my pictures in manual mode always so this is not a problem for me. the colors are nice and natural and not fake like other brands. the sound quality is there and with headphones sony shines the most. the 1000mx3 that came free are the best pair of headphones i own to date, amazing sound quality and noise cancelling is if not the best. battery life is good for what i use it for during the day but if you a heavy user you will wish sony put a bigger battery on this beast of a phone. my only issue so far was the side sensor on the screen but i could careless, i turn it off in option. my other issue was getting used to the new way of getting things done because everything is different but after a day i was already used to it. i wish sony would had just made the finger sensor the same as the power . amazing phone!! highly recommend",3,"Sony"

The screen is great for vids but also text and reading is very crisp. I sorta slammed it for the speakers, but there's a Dolby Atmos engine that you can enable from the drop down shade, with various audio profiles, with mixer. This produces some very rich combos and is louder. The power mgmt is great, despite the smaller batter in this class and I'm loving the easy unlock with the side FP reader. There’s a lot to review on this phone and many have gone over specs and standard features I won’t cover here. Being a fan of 4K HDR home entertainment, I was truly interested in how the Sony X1 screen looks and feels. On the right side of the device starting from the top and working down is the volume rocker, the fingerprint reader, power button then a camera button. You hold the phone naturally and your thumb is right on the fingerprint reader, it’s very responsive and once enrolled has worked every time. I also enrolled my left hand index and digitus medius fingers and for me, it wasn’t a challenge to unlock. I mention this because at first one might think ‘wow they are ignoring the left handed user’. I’d suggest give it a shot first before judgement. The Xperia 1 has a beautiful screen and a narrow build, which really feels good in the hand. As I let others cautiously hold it they immediately commented on the fit in hand. It’s thin, but well-built and the narrow design is going to have a lot of engineers thinking about screen size and comfort. But this one is really tall… Candy bar phones are back on the menu! It’s glossy shiny black and has the fingerprints to prove it, but hey we polish our phones all the time now right? I copied over a 4K HDR rip (err backup) and though it looked great, I’ve also tested a few 4K ‘HDR’ vids on the web, very impressive. Pro tip: Using the stock vid player app try changing to ‘creator mode’ to get ‘faithful reproduction’ and 4K. Another tip: When in YouTube just drag the screen ‘out’ with two fingers to expand to the largest viewing area the content will display. Also make sure you choose 4K content from the settings, most likely the app will default to 1080p or lower, depending on your connection speed. When in the native app, double tap to auto fill the screen. These tips made my experience and showing off the phone’s epic screen much more enjoyable. For recording, the phone comes with “Cinema Pro” for video. It also has a fairly standard camera app. There are a few Sony experience items of varying interest: -A vibrate setting called “Dynamic Vibration” that you can adjust which is in sync with the audio playing, give it a force feedback feel for the audio output. -Home launcher with a back and home button, but no ‘recent’ tap button. To get to recent apps swipe up on the home. -The drop down shade has standard toggle and brightness management options with a settings button, although very tiny. -Uses Google Voice for automation, with the widget installed on the home screen and swiping left takes you to the more detailed Google assistant app itself. Both of these can be disabled by holding down on the wallpaper to manage the ‘Home settings’. -Volume down and power button for quick screenshot (or hold power button and select screenshot) -In the settings there is an Xperia Assist app with some battery management, storage clean up wizards and some tips. -Not a lot of wonky pre-installed apps, standard stuff like FB, NF and a few games which have a proper disable option. Very clean delivery on this unit. - No tool needed for the sim tray here, just a clean fingernail and you can load the tray and yes, an SD card for storage. What’s not included? I’ve been used to wireless charging for some time now and most would say at this price point it’s a shame not to have it. But it does have the now standard USB-C which is nice so you don’t have to worry about plugging it up wrong. Except for my nightstand, wherever I have wireless charging I also have USB-C for faster quick charging so I’m not as attached to wireless as I used to be. To drive a screen this size I would have preferred a larger battery than the included 3330mAh. The phone doesn’t have a headset jack, but does come with a standard ear bud set and USB-C to 3.5 mm adapter. Be sure to remove the plastic film off the headset controller, it covers the mic! It’s an offset design with one ear bud length about 8 inches the other earbud 20 inches away from the controller. It’s a MH750. The speakers are located on the bottom (facing down) and the ear piece facing forward. At moderate levels they are fine but going past 75% gets really tinny, close to some distortion. I’d like to see an improvement here to match the cinema level quality of the screen. I’d like to see an improvement to brightness. A screen like this should really have a glow option (max bright) and I just wasn’t seeing that. It’s not dark it just doesn’t go nova. I’m going to monitor the reply section, post questions if you like and I’ll test or report what you want to know about! Overall, I love this phone, its zippy smooth and mainly due to its screen and feel in the hand, cool fingerprint placement, it’s a great experience. If there were a bit more brightness and battery 4.5 stars would have been 5.",12,"Sony"
"3190","B081H6STQQ",3,"false","Update: If you like sending and receiving picture texts regularly you might want to wait until the bugs get worked out. I thought I had it fixed so I could send and receive twice but now it's glitching again and won't let me fix it. It's annoying af because now I have to send/receive pics thru FB messenger and that's ridiculous for the price of the phone. It also has issues with some games. (mainly some FB games) The screen glitches a bit. It doesn't interfere with playing but looks odd. I hope they fix the SMS issue soon tho cuz that could get old fast despite being able to swype lol. Still love the graphics and sound. Hate the sucky ringtones tho. As a diehard iPhone fan, I wasn't too sure about making the jump to an android phone but OMG the Sony Xperia 1 is amazing! The graphics, the speakers and sound, the game enhancer - wow! Some things are a PITA (pain in the...umm, yeah, lol) like figuring out the fingerprint reader (nearly pulled my hair out before I aced that one) and exiting from some of the FB games (OMG) but the annoyances are minor compared to what you're getting. The 4K OLED by itself makes the phone a no brainer gotta have one click buy but when you add in the Dolby Atmos sound and those sweet speakers, not to mention the way the vibration thing pulls you into the music when you're listening to your tunes or watching Youtube music videos or movies (you gotta experience it to understand cuz it can't be explained adequately). It's a whole nother dimension to treat the senses! I'm loving the triple lens camera, too. It takes amazingly fabulous pictures. (see the one I took of my food. Almost put a pic of my grandson but subbed in this instead cuz it's less personal. Still, gotta love the clarity and detail and that's just a photo OF the photo on the screen taken by another phone so imagine how it looks in person!) Can't wait to play with the new cinema recording function Cinema Pro, too. Can you tell I love this phone? All I can say is if you're on the fence and you like watching movies on your phone, or music videos, or just jamming to your tunes - with or without headphones - scroll up and grab it. You won't be disappointed.",2,"Sony"
"3191","B081H6STQQ",5,"false","I love my new phone. I've been dying to do a review for a while, but it's got so many layers it's tough to summarize all the pros and cons. Let me start out by saying that I am not a technical expert on cell phones, I'm just a user. This phone is the best phone I've ever got to use for pictures and videos. It Bosts a 21:9 cinema display. You can tell when you watch videos on this device. Excellent for streaming. The ratio is great for those that like film making. I've read reviews where plenty of people have recommended the Experia1 for film making due to the high quality and potability of the device. I took my phone on vacation with us recently and I love the pics that I took. The Experia1 easily replaces my iPhone 7 plus. The world's first 21:9 CinemaWide™ 4K HDR OLED display and a pro-quality triple lens camera. Need I say more. The Eye FA mode is one of Sony's advanced features found in its cameras. I don't know the technical information on it, I just know that it makes for excellent pictures. The sound quality is also exceptional. I haven't had an issue yet while making a call. The Experia1 is also a good size. Fits nicely in my hand. It's just as long as my iPhone 7 plus, but less wider. I imagine that is so to achieve the 21:9 ratio. This is a good Segway now to go over the cons. * In some movies, I get a dark play back. While watching the same movie in my iPhone, the picture was brighter. * The touch screen is sometimes too sensitive. I end up bringing up a feature that I don't want to use. * it has finger print detection, but I haven't found a good case that would allow me to use that feature. More pros... * You can shrink windows for multi tasking. * It gives you quick access to the last apps that you have used. * Comes with awesome movie making and picture taking aps. * Easy access to recent news and events. * It has a built-in game mode enhancer. Overall, I recommend the Experia1. It's quickly replacing my iPhone.",1,"Sony"
"3192","B081H6STQQ",5,"false","I love the camera on this phone. The screen is huge, the 4k colors are vibrant, and the processor is fast and efficient. I think the thing I have enjoyed the most is that in the month I have owned it, it has never crashed or had any bugs. This is a rarity in my experience with Android phones. My critique would be the finger print scanner. It's located on the right side of the phone and you use your thumb to unlock it. It works about half the time. The problem seems to be that phone cases get in the way, blocking the access partially. I have bought and tried two cases and both had the same issue. This is a big miss in my opinion.",1,"Sony"
"3193","B081H6STQQ",5,"false","I've been an Xperia user for several years and I have to say that Sony has come a long way! No ugly notches. No big chins either. No pesky rounded screen edges. This phone was thoughtfully designed with the consumer in mind. Yes, they got rid of the headphone jack. But that's the way things go. Anyway, I am very much delighted with this phone. The Xperia 5 just came out, but I opted to get this instead. Can't beat the bigger and 4K OLED screen! This is bigger than my XZ3, but it feels a lot lighter and easier to hold.",1,"Sony"
