"2","B00D35Z6OE",4,"false","Bought this for sale at Officemax on Black Friday The Huawei Glory(Net10) runs on the Verizon Network and the call quality is very good and the reception I would rate as above average to good. What else I liked: The phone has Android O.S. Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 installed and runs very smooth switching and opening up the various applications. The stock Android Browser did a great job as I browsed various mobile sites and websites. Youtube videos and streaming audio worked very good with the 3G speeds that my Glory was receiving at the time. Another positive is the solid construction of this phone. It is thicker than the Huawei Ascend 2( an older Huawei model) and you'd almost expect there to be a slide out keyboard. Some people do not like a bit bulkier phones but in this case I feel that Huawei took care for a more solid constructed phone resulting in hopefully a long phone life. For a phone of this price range the sound was surprisingly good. Loud enough but not too loud and you won't get that tinny sound you can get with some other inexpensive cell phones. Has a built in FM receiver along with an app and a widget. Up to 40 presets can be saved. What I didn't like: Camera is only 3.2 megapixels, no flash and no way to turn the shutter sound off. I'd say the camera would be adequate to use for bar code reader apps and portrait photos in reasonably well lit environments. Battery life isn't too good. Moderate use would chug through battery life. Best use would be voice calls and light data use and it may make it through a day if you're lucky. Downloading apps and streaming music blazed through battery life rapidly. Other than FM radio very disappointing as to the selection of included apps or widgets. Had the whole google suite of apps which I will not use anyway with the exception of the Google Play Store. It does have a version of Quickoffice that will only view documents-- no editing or creating. Phone doesn't come included with an sd card. Doesn't bother me as they're cheap enough to buy anyway. The Glory supports up to a 32 GB SD Card. A few more things. The SD card is in a poor location. The back cover must be removed and battery lifted from its slot to fit the card in its place across from where the battery sits. I did not use the wi-fi or bluetooth features yet. When I do use these I will return and update my review accordingly. All in all, this is a solid phone. 4 stars at the Black Friday price I paid and about 3.5 stars at regular price. If the Glory had a decent camera I would have bumped up the rating one notch.",35,"HUAWEI"

I used it about 6 months,like it okay, but since my husband had a Verizon phone and wanted me to try a larger android phone, I joined him in Verizon family plan. That is legalized burglary! I liked the LG g2 phone from Verizon ok, but it wasn't any better than the Huawei Glory, just bigger that took up too much room in my purse, and didn't fit in my pocket very well either. So I went back to my Glory phone and TracFone. (My husband still has Verizon.) My Glory sounds as good as the LG, and for $100 per year ( I bought the 365 day 400 min. airtime with triple minutes, and put the 16gb memory card in.

"14","B00D35Z6OE",3,"false","I purchased the Glory and used it for between 1 and 2 weeks just to try it out but didn't activate it. Its basic functions as an android device and communicating over wifi were fine. It seemed attractive and well made for a $100 device. Then I became interested in the ZTE Valet and bought one of those too. At someone's suggestion I installed an app called Quick System Info Pro on both phones. I'm no expert but this app seemed to indicate that the ZTE manages its memory much better - lots more available space in just about every category. Plus the ZTE was $20 less at BestBuy. I think the Glory is a little better made and operates a bit more smoothly, but the $20 and the memory factor swung it for me, I returned the Glory - but I don't think you'd be disappointed with it. BTW the Glory has an FM radio, which would be nice, but the Valet has a flash for its camera (which can be used as a flashlight); this seems to me to be a much more useful feature.",25,"HUAWEI"

"20","B00D35Z6OE",1,"false","I bought this as my first smart phone, and I'm really wishing I'd spent some extra money on a phone that was worth my time. Every day I struggle with this piece of crap. It's slow, unresponsive, it constantly freezes on me. It closes apps at random. Most frustratingly, it keeps opening up the ""recent apps"" list in the middle of everything else I'm trying to do. I'll close the list and immediately it'll pop back up, and it'll do this until I get mad and restart the phone. The battery sometimes is good for a day or two, and sometimes the battery will be drained in a matter of a few hours, even if I haven't used it all day. Also, it doesn't come with a SD card. You have to buy it separately. The phone comes pre-loaded with a bunch of apps and features you really can't disable if you want to use it for anything other than a paper-weight, so if you like to play games or put music on it, you'll need to buy a SD card.

"24","B00D35Z6OE",4,"false","I didn't buy this item from Amazon; I bought it from Walmart simply because I didn't want the hassle of returning the item if defective. The clerk told me I could return it for any reason within the first two weeks. My previous tracfone was little more than a couple of tin cans connected by string. It was that basic. I am the last hold out to go Android. I had a gift card, and Walmart had a good price. I selected this one, because I wanted a Sansa MP3, but I didn't want to spend the money. I wanted a phone that got good reception, and an MP3. The reception on my old $9.99 phone was horrible. The audio on this is pretty decent. Can't complain, and the music on the MP3 sounds good. A reviewer wrote that if you're just coming up from a cheapie phone, this one has a steep learning curve. I agree. I spent an entire hour trying to load my contacts. I almost cried. Do yourself a favor, download the manual online. Once I read the manual, voila! Instant pro. I agree that the micro SD is in an inconvenient place, but once I loaded mine, I opened the phone and there was all my music! I didn't have to do anything. I couldn't find the little covers for the screen, so I bought a screen cover for an Android 4 at Walgreens. With a little trim, I was set. Ordered the lime green phone sleeve from Amazon. About tracfone customer service, I think they get a bad rep from people who don't like that they are in India, etc. My CS rep, Clinton, was wonderful. Because I lost my other phone and he was having trouble with a slow computer, we were unable to find out how many minutes I had left, nor could he put me on the monthly plan. Very apologetic. He gave me 180 minutes to start off with and transferred my old phone #. No biggie. I may just buy airtime cards at Walmart. With triple minutes, 180 minutes/month is more than I had before, and more than I need now. Camara is fair. But again, if you want to do the fancy stuff, get a real camara. I'm a photographer myself, and my old phone would take great closeups if you were patient and made sure to get good light. First photo was a selfie---it's a phone, not a miracle worker. Second was some clouds. Happy to see you can get a closeup by spreading your fingers across the screen. Overall, if you want something a little better than a basic cheapie $9 phone, this one won't break the bank. I don't text, but I sent my very first text and even emailed myself. It was easy. I know, I'm pathetic, but in the past, I have refuse to be ruled by a gadget. In this case, however, for the first time, I will care to know where my phone is and it will go everywhere that I go. I don't think that I will be texting or checking email when dining with friends (my pet peeve). If you want to do fancy things with it like office, get on a laptop.",1,"HUAWEI"
"25","B00D35Z6OE",3,"false","I bought a reconditioned Huawei Glory smartphone from TracFone when I opened my account. It cost only $29, so I really can't complain. It is a good phone for the money. What I don't like about this phone - compared to an iPhone 4 (GSM, so it wouldn't work with TracFone in my area), is that it has a plastic screen. Being plastic, as compared to the glass used in iPhones, any tap or swipe is not as accurate. I get very frustrated when I tap on an icon, and either get nothing at all, or a completely different app starts up. I purchased a stylus, but it didn't do any good. It takes too much pressure to activate the touch screen. I don't like the camera, as it is a fixed-focus and will not work for depositing checks, or scanning UPC or QR codes. I do like that it is an Android, and not iOS, as I was able to easily root the phone, and I have Ubuntu Linux on my home pc, so it mates up very well when connected via USB. I read about some users having trouble with the micro SD card. I bought a Kingston card and have had no trouble at all with it. If you have trouble with your SD card, I recommend removing it from the phone, plugging it into a micro SD to USB converter and accessing it from a Linux pc. There you can reformat the card to create several partitions, and, using the proper apps, will allow you to extend the amount of storage for both apps and data. If I had paid a lot more for this phone, I would be very unhappy. But considering that I paid only $29 for it, I am happy. My next phone will still be an Android, but it will have a glass screen.",NA,"HUAWEI"
"26","B00D35Z6OE",5,"true","Great phone and the one thing best about this product it costs me less than 100 dollars. I got it for my wife with the subscription from Trac Phone and the total cost was a lot less than you would pay for a phone with a plan.

"28","B00D35Z6OE",3,"false","I am a senior and this is my first smartphone. I've been learning how to use this phone for over two months now and find myself like a kid gazing at the phone in my hand for many moments on end. The voice quality is better than my old phones and the Verizon network is good, though there is a big coverage hole west of my home. This is a triple minutes phone, meaning I buy 600 minutes for $40 and texts and data are included in separate additional buckets. Lasts me for 2 months or more, so $20/mo or less. The value is good but the phone has some problems. 1) Most frequent aggravation is keyboarding. Keying texts or contacts or anything takes longer than it should due to small keys and erratic touch screen. Turning phone on its side makes the keyboard bigger, but is still a problem. 2) Have been unable to get Bluetooth to work. Won't pair with my existing Jabil speaker or connect with my Mac. 3) Unable to transfer photos to Mac with either Iphoto, Image Capture, or an application called Android File Transfer. The last two wouldn't even see the phone when it was wired to the Mac. Battery life is not strong and some apps like GPS draw power rapidly. I bought a car charger to help when using the phone on long drives. I do like some of the new capabilities but cannot recommend the phone due to the problems above.",2,"HUAWEI"
"29","B00D35Z6OE",3,"false","My Huawei Glory is a Tracfone. Tracfone's insufferable customer service notwithstanding, the phone is decent for the price and the low-cost service works for me. Since I'm mostly at home and work, I've used the wifi for data almost exclusively. I have learned some things about it in the 2 weeks I've been using it that are worth noting. • My SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC Class 10 did not work in the phone. It was continually ""unexpectedly removed"" which made it useless for moving apps to it and useless with the mp3 player. I replaced it with a SanDisk 16GB microSD standard (class 4?) card and it seems to be working ok. • I have noticed that the phone needs to be rebooted after working with it (installing apps, setup, etc.) like an old Windows 98 system. I assume this is an Android thing and because the phone is low-end in terms of memory and speed. It takes about 30 seconds to reboot, so it's not a huge pain. • The camera is useless for depositing checks. While it has a higher megapixel rating than other Tracfone models (3.2), it does not make clear close up pictures suitable for mobile deposit of checks. I had to take the picture several times to get one my bank's app would accept, then the check was later rejected (with a $12 return fee). Unfortunately, this feature was one of the main reasons I wanted a smart phone in the first place. • The preinstalled apps cannot be uninstalled through the phone's system. Though there are apps and hacks that claim to be able to remove them, the dependencies among the apps make removing them more trouble than it's worth. • The default mp3 player is very limited: I've been using Rocket Player (free) with iSyncr ($3.99) to transfer music files from iTunes and it's worked great (with the standard micro SD card). • Finally I'll mention my disappointment with reminder alarms: another main reason for having a smart phone was to get alerts from my Google calendar. The alerts from the calendar apps I've found are not great - they only play the alert once, or it's not loud enough, so the reminders go unnoticed. This may be solved with more trial and error, but initially it's frustrating.",39,"HUAWEI"

However, for me, the selling point was the built-in FM radio, and it sounds terrible. I mean, it gets great reception, but the sound is awfully distorted. It's as if the EQ is turned all the way up, and there's no EQ anywhere in the phone or the app to correct the problem. All the other apps sound fine (Pandora, Google Play Music, Netflix, making telephone calls). I've Googled the problem in the hopes of finding a solution but I've found nothing that doesn't revolve around messing with ROMs and Kernels, and that's way over my head. Maybe my phone is the one-in-a-million that sneaked past QC, but it's not worth my time or effort to send it in for repair. The problem isn't a deal breaker.

It says 2gb of space, what they mean is that there is 2gb of space for music, photos, etc. But, there is only about 450mb of space for apps, so you can have about 3 apps. I couldn't even trust it to make a call anymore, that is how slow it got. The lock screen even lags. I switched to a flip phone, and it is a lot better than this piece of junk.

"36","B00D35Z6OE",2,"false","When I accidentally left my phone on a park bench while on an extended vacation, I had to buy the only smartphone running Net10 I could find in a tiny town 400 miles away from my good phone. I've had Net 10 for 2 years and have NEVER had an issue with their customer service that other people have noted. Keep in mind all the customer service reps sound and act like they are in Asia so you do need to be specific and clear when talking with them. I bumped up my review from one star to two only because of how well Net10 has treated me for the last two years. Now, for this phone. This phone has been slow from the time I opened the box. Nothing loaded and it drags incessantly. There are many Google apps that I don't use and can't get rid of, but they keep trying to update and then run an error message of ""not enough memory to complete this upgrade"". After finally loading all my contacts that thankfully were backed up on my Google account from my good phone then the phone started running worse. I tried to download Temple Run, but had to immediately uninstall it because it bombed this phone. I can barely get the Facebook app to run. To struggle through the day this phone must be restarted at least once, maybe twice. Then it must be shut down each night before placed on the charger at bedtime. I tend to restart the phone after running every program, Facebook, email, browser. I've had the phone less than 2 months and have had to clear my browser, phone list and text list twice or it would begin freezing constantly. I've searched the web for optimization hints, but all the reviews talk about how great this phone is with the 1mHz processor. Battery life is odd. Sometimes it will make it two days before needing a charge, other times it is less. The longer I have it the worse it is getting. I do charge my phone every night regardless, so this is really a non-issue for me. To finalize, the last reason for the elevated two stars is for the cellular reception. It runs on the Verizon pre-paid network. Before buying this phone, please check the pre-paid map on Verizon's website.

Since the last time it was in for service it seldom recognizes my voice - and I usually have to scream into the phone for it to recognize my voice. So frustrating. I've trained and retrained the voice module to no avail. It has a feature that keeps the phone unlocked when at certain coordinates that you set as safe places. Yeah, that doesn't work anymore either. This is the first time I spent $600 on a phone and will NEVER make that mistake again. The $30 LG I bought to use while this was in for service (again and again) worked nearly as well. I especially liked on the LG that I could say ""whiskey"" and it would take Picture.

And of course Huawei offers a guarantee of 12 months (1 year), 12.5 months after, 2 weeks ago, my phone started to shut down when there was still 20% of battery life. Now after fully charges, and 10 minutes of use, it is turning down by itself. I have to walk around having the phone connected to external charger. I have not contacted Huawei yet as i know for sure they will tell me, sorry 12 months is up. Hope somebody reads this and assist me as this is unbearable. I was always happy with Nexus phones and this is a huge let down. UPDATE: I have contacted customer services, a guy name Rick told me that I was still under the guarantee. I'm sending it to have it fixed. I hope they do. BTW, Rick was a great help. UPDATE 2: So i sent the item and got it back ""repaired"". I used it 3 days with no issues and it turn off by itself and now is stuck in initial Google screen.

"41","B019TWO7DU",1,"true","PLEASE PLEASE BEWARE of this device. I must admit that I first I loved it but in less than a year, it became useless. Just go on the Google, and you'll see there is a known issue with this device's software and battery . It leads to quick battery drain followed by the device shutting down (often with 20-25% battery left). Other customers get locked into a bootloop. Both Google and Huawei acknowledge the issue but that doesn't help you if this phone is your only means of communications. If you purchase directly from Google, they will do an immediate exchange but dealing with Huawei can be a nightmare or be a process that takes up to a month. Huawei rep freely admitted that the device they send back to you might encounter the problem again. Google support just tells you they are aware of the problem but that is no fix. Unlike Apple, you have no physical store to go to. You have no loaner phone to use while you send the phone away for months. Im so disappointed and angry with this fiasco as the owner of the device has no landline, needs phone access to communicate with medical professionals or even take an Uber. Long story short, this phone is too good to be true. If you havent encountered the problems yet, be glad. They will come for most people. Google says the problem involves software updates but after all this time, there are no fixes.",7,"HUAWEI"
"42","B019TWO7DU",1,"true","My phone is at the same 1.5 year mark as everyone else and it's shutting down at 25+% battery. Also It'll show in the battery settings that it's used about 4% of the battery, but the battery itself is at 81%. That being said, I unplugged it from the charger at 5 am, took it to work and put it in my locker where it's sat with GPS, bluetooth and everything else off. I then check at 9 am and voila it's at 81% after having done nothing for 4 hours. This has become much more apparent over the course of the last few months, along with a host of other issues that are cropping up (similar to the other 1 star comments) As for the phone itself: The camera takes pretty good pictures and has a photo-sphere function that I love to use for my 3D modeling (not a selling point for everyone). I've never had major issues with the camera other than that. Software was working good for the most part up until these battery issues showed up and now certain things like Google Drive will re-start uploads from 1-2 months ago that never finished due to connectivity or something and just show ""UPLOADING"" till I restart the phone. Cell service has been decent but on the spotty side if I do say so myself. I switched from a Sprint phone to this thinking that I'd get the best of both worlds and it seems like I get less coverage than either sprint or t-mobile (which Fi is supposedly using both). My guess is that both companies are giving Google Fi their worst bandwidth/frequencies at a discount rate. Either way, I drop one of every 5 calls and wi-fi calling will cut in and out randomly on my phone while my roommates are also using the wi-fi calling on apple or Samsung products and not having any issues. All of this being said, I don't call most of the time and I really like paying only for what I use, and usually go under my 2Gb limit for the month. So there's that. In Summary: I wish now that I'd spend the extra $50 to $100 dollars on a manufacturer that would've made this phone with more quality parts. I like the phone in general and feel cheated having to spend another $5-600 getting a new phone seeing as this one is becoming unusable after only 1.5 years. Bummer.",14,"HUAWEI"
"43","B019TWO7DU",5,"true","As an iPhone convert, I was a little skeptical about making the move to Nexus and Android as a whole. I thought the transfer of my data would be hard (it wasn't), and I had a bunch of misconceptions about Android that were ultimately way wrong. I've made the switch and I don't think I'm ever going back. What Google has made is not only the iPhone's cheaper competitor, but also the Android OS as it was made to be; in it's purest form. I've always associated the Android OS with bloatware from carriers, resulting in a not so minimal and often ugly-looking phone. I've also never experienced Android on a premium device, meaning that it left a bad taste in my mouth when I used the OS on some cheap devices. But with Nexus, you get the real Android experience. Everything is buttery smooth, fast, fluid, intuitive, and most importantly, customizable. From the ground up, you can make your phone the way you want it to be. It's up to you how you want your phone to work. Anyways, enough about the OS. Let's talk about the phone itself and what makes it great. 1. Price & Value I buy my electronics for the long haul. The 6P is built superbly and has Gorilla Glass protecting its front and back. Despite what other say, I also find it easy to hold and don't worry about losing my grip on it. The 6P is sturdy, sleek, and unique all at the same time. I also want a good deal too. The 6P delivers on both of those fronts. It's main competitor, the iPhone 6s Plus, is $649 unlocked, and that's for a 16GB model. My 32GB 6P cost around ~$400 after some discounts at Best Buy. There's no doubt in my mind that the 6P is one of the best deals on the market right now. 2. Fingerprint Scanner The placement of the fingerprint scanner (top of the back) is perfect. It's just real natural to place your finger there to unlock your phone, nothing awkward about it. You can also log multiple fingerprints too, meaning that you could pick up the phone with either hand and unlock it. If you prefer not having to enter a password, your prints can be used to buy apps from the Play Store and open certain apps. The scanner is also one of the fastest, if not the fastest out there. The scanner is also incredibly accurate as well. In the few days I've used it, I can count on my hand the number of times it's incorrectly read my print, and that's probably user error. Simply put, Google is killing it here. 3. Camera Talk about a nice camera. I'll let the pictures I took do the talking. While Google's camera app leaves a little to be desired at times, it gets the job done. The camera performs great in all kinds of lighting, and is adept at adjusting to its surroundings. 12 MP is as good as it gets right now in smartphones, and while it's not DSLR-quality, your Instagram feed will still look good. Speaking of DSLR, I took some photos with my Nikon D40 for comparison. The first two are Nexus. *the photos below were untouched.* 4. Design/Size First of all, this phone isn't big at all. No, you don't need to be Lana from Archer to use this phone. I upgraded from a meager iPhone 4s, and was quite concerned about this phone's seemingly gargantuan size. But once you get it in hand, you'll see that you were worried about nothing. It's hard to explain, but you'll never want to have a small phone again after your first day with the 6P. It just feels right. Once you learn how to cradle the phone the right way, you'll forget about the phone's size. If you're still worried about the size, check out this site to compare the 6P to your current phone. http://www.phonearena.com/phones/size I will concede that on some apps, it's mildly inconvenient to stretch your finger all the way across the screen, but this is a small tradeoff for the big beautiful screen that you get. I gushed about the design a bit earlier, but it really is the cat's balls. The front-facing speaker is loud and clear, and won't muffle unless you put your phone face down. On the top, the earpiece produces great call quality and makes it easy to hear your caller. The phone is easy to hold, and the power/volume buttons don't get in the way. The aluminum and metal build make the phone feel and look premium, and it seems as if Google didn't cut any corners in designing this unit. 5. Battery Life A lot of critics have been gushing about this, and rightfully so. Without adjusting any of my settings, or using any battery management apps, the 6P can easily make it through a day and then some of heavy use. This varies of course, but I'm content as long as my phone makes it though the day without needing a charge. If you mess with your settings and/or use apps, the 6P can easily last you a couple of days if you manage the battery effectively. You can also easily analyze which apps are effecting battery performance. Using Google's official cable/adaptor, it takes about a little more than an hour for my phone to go from zero to one-hundred. That's from zero to one-hundred real quick. While the whole USB-C setup isn't exactly ubiquitous yet, it's fast and great for data transfer. The USB-C is reversible and can also be used to reverse charge, meaning that your 6P could charge someone else's USB-C device. 6. Software/Hardware As I said before, Android is what you make of it. Marshmallow is a great OS, and that's amplified by the fact that Google gives you no bloatware or add-ons. I believe that out of the box, only around 3 GB of the 32 total GB is occupied. It's the purest form of Android, how it was meant to be. Everything flows great. Google Now and it's cards are also really convenient once it gets to learn about you. The animations are smooth, glitchless, and the phone is fast thanks to 3GB of RAM. Nexus users also get Android updates first before the general populace, meaning your phone is up-to-date. You can expect these Nexus-only benefits to grow in the future as Google makes it like their iPhone. The Nexus is also equipped with real good hardware. The Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM, and Adreno 430 GPU all work in harmony to keep your experience with games, apps, and multitasking lag-free. The Samsung AMOLED 1440 display is also one of the best screens on the market right now. Heck, the pictures I took looked way better on my Nexus before I uploaded them on my laptop. Colors are bright and vibrant, and video is top-class. The brightness also has a wide range. At its lowest, the screen is even a little too dark for nighttime use. At it's brightest, it can contend with the bright sun. 7. Cellular Data I've been using Google's Project Fi thus far, and I'm really impressed. I got my SIM card in the mail and a nice phone stand LEGO set from them in the mail free of charge. Porting my number over took about five minutes, and my service has been great. Fi uses T-Mobile and Sprint for data, and places calls over Wi-Fi when possible by using encryption/VPN. Using my phone out and about almost seemed faster than my in-home Internet, and calls over both Wi-Fi and cell were clear and great quality. You can also manage your data in the Settings by alerting you when your data used reaches a certain amount, and you can even set a limit that will turn off your phone's data when exceeded. 8. Misses While the Nexus 6P is great by almost every standard in the book, here are a few things I wish this phone would have. - wireless charging - dual SIM port - expandable micro SD - removable battery - different screenshot option (Pressing power/volume down at the same time is awkward. Thankfully you can long press the home button and press the share button on the left to bypass this.) Overall, the Nexus 6P is probably the best value on the phone market. You've got top-of-the-line performance at a significant discount from its main competitor in the Apple 6s Plus, and you get Android in its greatest form. With a great camera, display, hardware, software, and preferred treatment from Google, the Nexus 6P should be in your pocket. PICS #1 & #2: shot with Nexus 6P; no editing #3 & 4: shot with Nikon D40 DSLR; no editing #5: Backside of 6P #6: My gross hand #7: Backside with camera/mic/scanner #8: Side (SIM port on top left) #9: My home screen. Just showing what cool things you can do with Android. Nova Launcher Prime and Moonshine are the launcher/icon combo I used. #10: Second screen. Same stuff. #11: What the battery screen looks like. Great for analyzing when and what effects your battery.",471,"HUAWEI"

I would give them a zero if I could. I do not mind paying for quality, in this case they are charging a premium for a known faulty device and do not stand behind what they make. Shame on Huawei and shame on Google for this scam.",7,"HUAWEI"

Ordered phone in March of 2016 and used it until September of 2017 when the problem started happening all of a sudden. This is a known issue with this phone and neither Google nor the manufacturer want to acknowledge it or Do anything about it. Others who purchased this phone directly through the Google Store have had their phones replaced immediately with Google pixel XL after reporting this problem however if you purchase this phone through Amazon you get no support from the manufacturer who does not want to acknowledge the problem. Calling to manufacture these days gets you put on hold for a long time until you are given a message that the support services are too busy and you just get disconnected without being able to reach anyone or leave voicemail.

"46","B019TWO7DU",1,"true","I've owned this phone for years. I bought it from Google, I still use it. I bought this refurbished version for my child. Good phone, low cost. Bad move. The battery is garbage, The phone goes from 100% to 50% in two hours, then immediately dies. Indicative of a bad/old battery. Very obvious the phone was not refurbished but simplly repackaged and and sold. Don't waste your money. Also refurbished unit is not sold by Huawei. So feel free it insult Amazon for for enabling fraud.",46,"HUAWEI"
"47","B01M6X8SDM",1,"true","To start with, if I could have returned this while it was under the 30 day return from Amazon I would have, but it didn't start having issues until about day 40. It started with the GPS not working after it had completed a route and then you tried routing back home. It simply will not get a lock and would estimate the position , which is not good while you are driving. After a few days of this it finally just quit working. I contacted Huawei's service department and it took 2 days to get them to issue an RMA to get the unit repaired. They sent a call tag for me to return the item and said it would take 7 to 10 days. It took a total of 16 days for me to receive the unit back (their repair center was getting shipped 10 miles from me) . It worked for about a week and ended up with the same issue. This model is known after I started searching for having issues with the GPS. I called and requested that Huawei issue me a new phone and I would return this one so that I didn't have to be without a phone for an additional 2 weeks as well as the fact I don't think it can be repaired or it would have been fixed correctly the first time. I was informed that they had to go through the RMA process and I didn't have any other options. So I am now writing my dissatisfaction with their company, and that if you need service, know that you are going to have to wait a long time and there is no confidence it will be fixed correctly. Other than that, the phone worked ok. I have been underwhelmed with the UI - it is proprietary and is ok, but definitely different trying to adjust from stock android UI. Battery life was above average and the phone ran programs quickly with no issues. I would not recommend this unit and suggest you search for GPS issues for Honor 8 before spending this much money on a phone.",30,"HUAWEI"
"48","B01M6X8SDM",1,"true","I loved this phone. It worked great, it looked amazing...then it stopped charging. I sent it in for repair to 2.5 weeks which is difficult when I use my phone for Work! They provide no loaner or options and have no local repair places. Received my phone back and I finally programmed everything back in to find out the charging situation WASN'T fixed. ALSO people can only hear me when I use speakerphone. So I know they attempted a repair but it is now worse. I have asked for a replacement unit and they refuse saying sending it for repair is their only way to proceed. After 6 month of the first issue my phone remains broken as they won't respond to emails and when speaking with them on the phone they say they will turn it into an upgraded case and have someone contact me, B.S.. I have heard from no one. I took my pictures to prove the phone isn't damaged for the second time and for two months have been waiting for shipping label to be sent. While it was repaired 10 days later I called in and they couldn't find my information. The person I spoke with wasn't even sure what my phone was there for. I asked if it was fixed and he said ""it sure is!"" I asked what they did and he said he had no idea. I explained the situation with it and he stated he was sure they replaced the battery. A little bit or irony. Their motto, ""Honor - For the brave!"" I know exactly what that means now. Be very brave if you go down the honor path!",38,"HUAWEI"
"49","B01M6X8SDM",5,"true","Absolutely love this phone. There are a few quirks here and there that you may have to get used to. The EMUI overlay Huawei put on Android is nice, but really resembles iOS in certain aspects. Having said that, in my opinion, this would be the perfect phone for someone looking to get the heck away from Apple (which I regularly encourage everyone to do). The layout is simple, but you are still able to customize a lot of different things, per the norm with Android. The camera is not impressive in low light, but in daylight it shines. Granted, it's probably not on par with the top of the line 2017 and 2018 phones, but this is a middle of the road 2016 phone, so that's expected. To put it in perspective though, the daylight photos on this phone absolutely blow away the photos on my recently deceased iPhone 6s. That's not saying much, as the 6s sucked on so many different levels. It reinforced my allegiance to Android haha. I digress... If you're looking for a high quality phone without the high end sticker price, this is the phone for you. It's also a gorgeous phone, so much so that I'm having a hard time putting a case on it because I want to leave it as is... but I don't want my phone to break haha. In comparison (and I'm not expert, but I've used both iOS and android, flagships and non-flagships over the years), the Honor 8 beats out the i6s in almost every category I can think of. Battery is equal to or longer lasting than the 6s, and charges a lot faster using the Huawei rapid charger (about the same with a 3rd party adapter) External storage option... need I say more, APPLE?! Beautiful screen. I didn't notice a difference in this screen to the 6s honestly, but I do need to revisit the eye doctor soon, so take that with a grain of salt. Perfect size for the average joe, 5.2"" screen is a great middle ground. I've had recent phones ranging from 4.7"" to 5.7"" and I'm quite happy with the Honor 8's 5.2"" screen. The Honor 8 beats out the 6s in speed all day long. The only two quirks I have yet to figure out is why my Plantronics Voyager Legend headset keeps regressing back to not having smart features. One day I'll have voice-command options on it, and the next day it won't work until I play with the settings off and on. Could be a phone thing, could be a headset thing. Haven't figured it out yet. The other quirk is that many apps won't send you notifications inherently. This is due to Huawei's crazy abrasive battery saving techniques. There's a simple setting you have to switch (again, just google it and they'll walk you through it). In all fairness the Honor 8 is 11 months NEWER of a phone, so these comparisons are comparing a newer phone to an older one. But, given the fact that the 6s is a ""flagship"" device and cost at least 50% more when it came out, I thought they were worthy of comparing.",3,"HUAWEI"
"50","B01M6X8SDM",5,"true","03/14/2017 Pistola de Oro 64 (Gold) This is to augment my other phone. For the price I made sense to have more memory. More pleased than ever with this device. Hope they both last. The OS is actually pretty intuitive. Coming from my work phone iPhone 6s it is comparable. That's not a bad thing. . 02/23/2017 Just did the Nougat 7.0 update. Seamless. Pixel doesn't doesn't have the pressure, sensitive fingerprint reader. Touch to open. A single press and it's a flashlight, double press messaging hold and it opens chrome.

The first week has been uneventful. ATT set me up with a nano sim for free. What really stands out for me is the HiSuite desktop user interface. While your phone is connected to your desktop or laptop via the UsbC cable, you can access photo's, contacts, edit apps, even message and watch videos on your desktop display! As far as the phone itself what's not to like? The BlueTooth connection to my Pioneer car stereo is reliable. Pandora sounds great and it thumps my subs. Google voice works ok. I like this phone. Devices reviews are so subjective. Everyone want's something different. I would say this phone does it all pretty well.",33,"HUAWEI"
"51","B01M6X8SDM",5,"true","What a fantastic phone for a little over $300! I previously had the iPhone 6 and then a Samsung Galaxy S7, this device exceeds the performance of either of those phones. It's snappy fast, hotspots well (I live in a rural area and my phone is my only internet!) and has a high quality display. This device packs a lot of great features into a small and affordable package. I put a Sparin clear case on it so the white shows off. People frequently comment on how sleek the phone looks and ask what it is. It's running the latest version of android and I'm extremely pleased. I will comment that while the camera on this is very good, it's not great in low light. In fact, the S7 camera was a superior camera but again...for the money you can't beat this phone. I've included a few shots from the camera so you can see image quality. the photos on the creek were snapped while the phone was in a watertight bag so that has a minor impact on the image quality as well, giving it a slightly hazy effect. This is not a splash resistant or waterproof phone as the Samsung S7 was or some of the Motorolas that are now available. If you're careful with your phone, it shouldn't be necessary but it's important to note. I selected the phone for the 64 GB harddrive storage and for the excellent processor and speed and it does not disappoint. This has the best fingerprint scanner on any phone I've used. I added my index and middle fingerprints so I have some flexibility depending on how I'm holding the phone and added my husband's fingerprint as well so if I'm driving he can operate my phone (Google Maps, etc.). It unlocks in an instant, super fast! Overall, highly recommended android phone for AT&T. I understand it's also compatible with T-Mobile but I have not tested it with that provider as they have poor coverage in the rural area I live.",12,"HUAWEI"
"52","B01M6X8SDM",5,"true","I researched phones for weeks before deciding on this one. I was focused on finding the best camera, speed, and network quality that I could for my price point. This phone exceeded my expectations in all of these areas. It was the best quality for the price that I found, hands down. To be honest, I am disappointed by the camera in low lighting. But when the lighting is moderate to good, the camera is excellent. There are SO MANY features in the camera, I haven't even had a chance to go through all of them yet. I like the ""beauty mode"" setting. ""Time-lapse"" and ""Light Painting"" are also really cool. Speedy phone. Apps open seamlessly. 64 gigs is great, so much room for everything. The screen is gorgeous. Vivid, bright colors. I activated this phone with T-Mobile and have had great call quality. I've gotten several comments from people on how clear my voice sounds, and I have noticed a significant difference in the quality of their voices as well. It's a beautiful phone. Sleek and smooth. Somewhat fragile, but just make sure to invest in a good case and screen protector.",10,"HUAWEI"
"53","B01M6X8SDM",4,"true","I love my phone!! Had to do about 3 updates after the first start up but now its running EMUI 5.0 and Androind 7.0 Nougat. The speed performance is amazing! Fingerprint sensor recognises print in less than a second on the first try. The camera is great! Being able to customize theme using the Huawei themes app from the play store is great! The only downfall I have is the fact that emojis are the odd looking android ones where its either black and white images or semi-circle faces. Not a big deal after I downloaded a keyboard that has the original emojis on it (the app is called 'iMore keyboard'). Another downfall is the fact that battery life is atrocious. Thankfully it recharges quickly. The phone also starts heating up pretty quickly. Outside of all this, the phone looks amazing, has great storage, great speed and doesn't look or feel cheap. 10/10 would recommend to someone looking for a phone that's less than $500 AND provides on-par service compared to high end phones like iPhone 7 plus or Samsung Galaxy S8. This is coming from someone who used to be a Samsung Galaxy S5 user who was looking to upgrade to either another galaxy or a recent iPhone.",3,"HUAWEI"
"54","B01M6X8SDM",5,"true","This is by far the best phone that I've owned. Aesthetically, it is beautiful; it takes amazing photos, is lightning fast, it's proprietary GUI is is awesome, but that is a very subjective thing -- some might like it and some might not. The saving grace for that is that you can still use custom launchers like Nova Launcher, and with 7.x.x (Nougat), it gives you more control over the EMUI/Interface. The full glass encasement of the phone really puts emphasis on this phone's beauty. I wouldn't cover the look of this phone by using a solid color case -- I'd suggest using the Sparin crystal clear case; it has reinforced corners, slightly raised edges so you can lay your phone face down without fear of scratching it, and they come in packs of two for $7.99 with free one day shipping for prime members. As for a screen protector, I spent about a week researching screen protectors and trying them all out. It's was a bit harder to find a decent screen protector for this phone because it has a beveled 2.5 dimensional screen, but after trial and error, I have found that the Nacodex glass screen protector does an amazing job at covering as much as possible without compromising the integrity of the screen protector. If you want a non-glass screen protector, radipest and dmax have thin anti scratch screen protectors that allows full coverage of the screen due to the screen protector's malleability. On top of that, this phone has some awesome hidden features like being able to assign functions to 'knuckle gestures'. An example of this would be when I knock on my screen with my knuckles, it takes a screen shot of the screen, or if I take and hold my knuckle on the screen, followed by dragging it around, I draw a frame around a specific part of the screen, I can take a cropped screenshot of whatever I drew the frame around. There are a ton more hidden and innovative features on this phone that I'm finding. Also, the finger print scanner works flawlessly even when holding the phone awkwardly. Overall, this phone is amazing.",6,"HUAWEI"

I've noticed there were some bad reviews but also good reviews so I went ahead and bought this anyway. I've had this for more or less half a year and this phone is still functioning fine. The battery life is still great and lasts for most of the day, though definitely it was better the first few months I had it (would last until the next day!). I bought a glass screen protector and a somewhat thin phone case, and have dropped it a few times from a table straight to the ground but it still works fine and there's no cracks. Not sure if this is waterproof off the top of my head but I have used the phone in the shower (just for music) and it has gotten a little wet before and it is still fine as well (definitely don't sink your phone to test anyway). The reason why I personally don't believe it deserves full 5 stars is because the camera isn't as crisp as I thought it would be, the default UI setup is not as practical and easy-to-use (but can be customized to your preference at least, just extra work), and I also noticed that there's no option to encrypt your data files on this Huawei phone. I've researched around and found that Huawei phones (not sure about all models) do not provide distinct encryption of data files versus normal Android phones with the Lollipop/Marshmellow update which is encrypted by default. I mean nonetheless Android encryption is probably trash and easily crackable anyway, but I do think security is important and you potential buyers should ensure some form of protection.

"109","B0791VS3N9",5,"true","I'm using this on AT&T in the USA, and it works great. It has possibly the best radio reception of any phone I've ever owned. I live in an area with spotty reception. With my old Samsung S4 and S5, it was about 50% odds whether the phone would ring, even if it was showing several bars. My next phone was a Moto X Pure, which would consistently ring as long as I was showing bars. This Huawei does just as well as my Moto, maybe even a little better. So I'd say that it has a GREAT radio/antenna design. This phone is awesome. It's blazing fast, has a great screen, great case, solid build quality. Huawei already has an Oreo update for this phone. I was a little worried about whether I'd like the EMUI interface; I definitely prefer stock Android. And I was a little disappointed that they went with a non-stock dialer. I got so spoiled with the built-in spam alerts in the stock dialer. But aside from that, it's really not too bad. You can tell some stuff has been skinned, but it's not nearly as bloaty as I remember TouchWiz being on the Samsung. Also most of the apps like facebook don't appear to be cooked into the ROM, because I was able to uninstall them (not just disable). A few minor UX annoyances: - They don't appear to have embraced the heads-up ring notification in their dialer...it's full screen even if the screen is on. - They have an AWESOME built-in way to hide the control bar at the bottom, but no easy way to go full immersive and hide the status bar. (still halfway immersive is better than nothing) - do not disturb - the status bar icon doesn't show any indication of *which* mode you're in (priority, alarm, total silence). Just shows the same crescent moon symbol for all. (The alarm icon will dim in total silence, if the alarm icon is visible...so that's what I use) - 8.0 navigation dock - I get that the gestures are kinda cool, but this lost functionality from the 6.0 dock, which had a lock button. I wish they gave you the option to use the old style dock - ""lock screen"" widget - works great if you use the stock home screen, but doesn't work if you replace the home screen (I like Nova better) attaboys: - this is the first phone that has showed my bluetooth headset battery level...that's awesome! - came with a very nice TPU clear case...never seen that before! - insanely good battery life...yesterday after 18 hours I was still at 70% Warning: If you like root, I was a little surprised after I ordered this to see that Huawei was in the process of phasing out their bootloader unlock code service. I had checked this out when I was researching a few weeks back, but they just made this decision public on 25 May. What the heck! I was able to get my code, but website says in 60 days they will cease providing codes at all. However even though I got my code, I actually haven't used it yet. I used to use root/xposed very heavily to tweak setup, but honestly with all they've done to allow for non-root tweaking in the last 3 versions of android, I've found there's really not much I actually need root for. I do miss my ad blocker a little bit, but it's a very minor thing, and I don't really have much ad-ware any more. Also I discovered that you can do a lot of tweaking with SystemUI Tuner. (Huawei disabled the built-in android tuner, which you normally get to by long pressing the gear icon until it spins...but there are non-root apps that can provide very similar functionality. This is how I got full-immersive capability to hide the status bar) All in all, definitely one of the best phones I've ever owned. And as for the CIA warnings...I don't know if the Chinese government is spying on my text messages...and I really don't care.",114,"HUAWEI"
"110","B0791VS3N9",5,"true","I'm not the techno phone geek many are but I demand a lot out of my mobile experience and this phone is more than up for it. It's fast, the battery seems to last forever -- haven't gone through a full charge in a day yet -- and my overall experience using it as a phone and a computer has been very good. The camera doesn't do well in low light, but the flash is adequate. Daylight pictures are exceptional. One feature I was meh about before purchasing was the finger print scanner and dang if it isn't the handiest thing ever. I've not had it fail and it gets me inside my phone fast. Flawless. I'm older and have some vision issues, so I appreciate the large screen. The phone was not loaded with bloatware and what few little apps I didn't want I was able to get rid of without a problem. I also have had no issue with any of my favorite apps working on this device. I take all kinds of kidding at the brand and the jokes about being spied on by the Chinese are fun. But honestly I find all's fair in the marketplace and in my estimation this phone is a real winner. I've used Samsung Note 4 and Note 5's, an iphone, and plenty of Blackberry's in my time and this phone tops them all. Seriously a great piece of equipment and an exceptional buy.",89,"HUAWEI"
"111","B0791VS3N9",5,"true","A quick bit of info. Between my wife and I we are currently using a Galaxy s8 and now this Huawei Mate se. We have been using the mate se for about 3 weeks now and feel confident in reviewing it. For starters like a lot of Americans we were not familiar with the Huawei brand when we went to purchase a new phone to replace an older model phone. We spent the better part of three days comparing various phones from a variety of makers with the phones we knew best Samsung Galaxy series. After reading many reviews both on seller sites and in tech magazines we decided that for what they were selling for on amazon ($249.99) if the Huawei Mate se was as good as we were reading we couldn't go wrong The phone we ordered was from a third party seller and they deserve some credit here after being quoted an arrival window of eight to ten days they got it to us in only four. So to bayshine store kudos to you on that one. Just out the box the phone looked good reminiscent more of iPhones then Galaxies in my opinion,either way startup and set up were a breeze. Now down to the brass tacks we have run several comparisons between this phone and our Samsung and honestly and I mean no disrespect to Samsung here this phone is almost on par with it. The few bells and whistles that this phone lacks are just that only bells and whistles. Just to point out some of our tests. Browsing the internet Playing games Listening to music Battery life Watching videos Camera Picture quality Camera Video quality Our results are surprising. In all of the categories except for camera picture/video quality the difference between them is almost moot the Samsung charges faster and has better low light picture and video capabilities. The only complaints I have about the mate se is regarding such trivial things as downloading themes and backgrounds. Stuff of that nature. We found that we were unable to send gifs over mms when using the primary texting software and we had to get the messenger app from the app store. These are all small little nuisance issues and easy to adapt to especially considering the Huawei costs almost a third of what we paid for the s8 when we got it. Now we don't feel confident to sit her and discuss the nuances of the specifications regarding this product but from a casual users perspective we could not be happier with Huawei's mate se phone. It is everything we need in a phone for an amazing price. I would and do recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a great phone. If you find this review helpful please let us know. If you have any questions we would be happy to answer.",1,"HUAWEI"
"112","B0791VS3N9",5,"true","Okay first of all let me get this out of the way. Do not worry about the chinese government spying on you lol Huawei is there to make money by selling phones, period. If you ask me I believe Samsung and apple had something to do with that spying rumor because they want to keep the competition down in America and Chinese phones pose a threat. After all why buy a phone for 1000 dollars when you can get one almost just as good for less than 300. So with that being said, this phone is amazing. Super fast fingerprint scanner, camera quality is amazing, if you handed this phone to someone who didn't know huawei, they would think you paid three times the amount that you actually did. I asked Huawei about a update to Android 8.0 and they said it is confirmed and should be released in April or May at the latest. The software is well optimized and I can get about 6 hours of screen on time with casual use such as calling, texting, and social media. You can zoom in the screen on apps to take advantage of the 5.9 inch screen. The speakers are not the loudest but the quality is good and clear. The audio through the headphones is really good and it also has a mode to improve it even further giving it a bit more bass. The only downside to me is it isn't USB type c, but with how great this phone is all the pros definitely make up for it having micro USB. With phones like this, from Huawei and xaomi, the days of paying 600 to 1200 for a good for are over.",471,"HUAWEI"
"113","B0791VS3N9",5,"true","bought the GOLD version of this Huawei Mate SE for $229 + sales tax from here on amazon. as an iPhone person who recently turned to Huawei, this is a fabulous great phone from Huawei. my iPhone was flaking out because of apple's horrible battery shutdown/slowdown problems. apple jumped the shark trying to fool people about what was really happening with iPhone batteries. anyways, previously got a nice AT&T-branded Huawei Ascend XT2 which was like my training-wheels version to get me ready for this much more powerful unlocked Huawei Mate SE. Huawei got me hooked with its EMUI 5.1 (based on Android 7.0) that is designed to kinda be reminiscent of the iPhone iOS, particularly when you turn off the app drawer, but still a powerful android. so switching to the new Huawei Mate SE was easy peasy. and having 4GB RAM and 64GB storage really helped a lot to make the phone much more comfortable to use without worrying about lack of memory or lack of space. oh, in comparison, looking at the Huawei Honor 7x here on amazon, but for a little bit more in price, the Huawei Mate SE is the definite better buy. both the Huawei Honor 7x and the Huawei Mate SE look the same but the major difference is the Huawei Mate SE is more powerful with the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. and the Huawei Mate SE is available in a GOLD version. my preferred phone gold color version. yea! definite no brainer. got the Huawei Mate SE. myself originally coming from iPhone, my suggestion to others regarding apps to make the transition in finding very good equivalent apps to iPhone's iMessages, Find My iPhone, and Find My Friends, is to go to the Google Play Store to download WhatsApp, Find My Device (from google), and Family Locator GPS Tracker (from Life360). and if you are like me thinking the android app drawer is a bit bothersome, well, you can turn it off in the settings on this Huawei phone. hopefully this advice should get you started if you want to have a more iphone-like experience on a Huawei phone. my journey is complete moving from iPhone to android where this Huawei Mate SE has become my primary phone. using this phone on AT&T and have 4G LTE. the Wi-Fi is only regular 2.5GHz wifi -- without the 5GHz wifi option (the Huawei Ascend XT2 has both 2.5GHz wifi and 5GHz wifi) but that's just fine if all your WiFi access is mostly to regular 2.5GHz wifi wherever you go and wherever you happen to be. personally still carry an iPhone as a backup phone in my go bag, but this Huawei Mate SE is my main phone now. went through other android phones, then recently got the aforementioned Huawei Ascend XT2, and now have this absolutely beautiful gorgeous Huawei Mate SE. physically very iphone-like and almost similar to the iPhone 7+ with the metal body plus with the dual camera on the back in the top corner like on the iPhone 8+ and then with the more modern 18:9 size front screen like on the iPhone X but without the iPhoneX ugly notch. also this Huawei Mate SE has a real must-have earphone jack. and this absolutely beautiful powerful phone performs smoothly with no lag. and Huawei seems to be hinting that Android 8 and most likely a newer EMUI are on the way for this and other Huawei phones for sometime during March 2018 or whenever. [edit: Honor 7x beta testing Android 8 and EMUI 8 began March 15. with maybe possible full release in April? (because news also reports Honor India says April for official release.) Huawei Mate SE should presumedly also get the android8 upgrade in the same timeframe sometime soonish whenever thereabouts is my guess....] so this phone will get even better with huawei support. yes, this Huawei Mate SE is very satisfactory. very happy with this phone. PS: people have commented in other reviews that if you turn on bluetooth, then the Wi-Fi slows down. this has particularly been reported in amazon reviews for the Honor 7x, and at least one other person mentioned it in a review here for the Huawei Mate SE. so, did a speed test to see what happens with my Huawei Mate SE on my home wifi internet: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had 47Mbps wifi internet speed; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had 31Mbps wifi internet speed. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is reportedly owned by Netflix). okay this is with an ARRIS TG2472G cable modem with built-in WiFi that can handle both 2.5GHz and 5GHz, but only 2.5GHz is relevant for the Huawei Mate SE, where my home internet is on the Cox Internet Preferred 100 Plan, and so my plan's internet speed can be as high as 100Mbps on the 5GHz side but typically half that on the 2.5GHz side. of course, we are only concerned with the 2.5GHz wifi. turning on bluetooth and getting 30+ Mbps wifi internet speed doesn't matter in a noticeable way to me on my home internet plan. however, if your home internet is much slower like on a basic starter plan with a maximum speed of 10Mbps or less, then proportionally any decreased wifi speed with bluetooth turned on could possibly be noticeable to you. sorry, if you are a big bluetooth user. me not use an android gear watch or bluetooth earphones. if you really don't use bluetooth, then keep the BT off and this issue won't matter to you when you are on wifi. but if you are out away from home trying to use free wifi which can be congested or which may have throttled speeds already, then this BT issue could affect you -- and so maybe just use cellular data in that situation if you really need your BT. personally, this BT issue is not a deal killer for me. this is a great phone imho. PSS: okay maybe the bluetooth-wifi issue is a load of hooey. tried testing wifi internet speed with the bluetooth turned on while on the Wi-Fi at my parents' home where they have a DLink 2.5GHz wifi router and where my folks are on the Cox basic starter internet plan that has an advertised max speed of 10Mbps: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had wifi internet speeds of 9.8Mbps and 11Mbps; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had wifi internet speeds of 8.4Mbps and 10Mbps. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is owned by Netflix). it's like no difference whether bluetooth is turn on or off as to the effect on wifi. but other real life factors could be involved -- that's for any picky bluetooth users to test, such as also using their particular bluetooth devices, because at this point, this so-called bluetooth-wifi issue is a non-issue for me. but my guess is if there is any effect, then it's a combination of your wifi router and/or your bluetooth device(s). (yeah, have previously seen differences in using a bluetooth speaker on my macbook versus on my iphone.) in other words, YMMV. bottomline as far as the Huawei Mate SE goes, get the phone, and if you are like me then you'll most likely love the phone. Another PS: (03/29/2018) just got the latest android security patch dated March 1, 2018 for the android 7 on this Huawei Mate SE. this is update version B130. it's not android 8 yet. comments elsewhere over on the xda-developer forum indicate that testing for android 8 (and also presumedly emui 8) on Huawei Mate SE may occur after testing is finished for the Honor7x. my guess at this point is to expect beta testing in April(?) or May(?) with official final distribution sometime soonish afterwards?? just have to wait and see. okay yeah would love to right now have android 8 (with treble to allow for more timely updates?), but this Huawei Mate SE, with android 7.0 and EMUI 5.1, plus with the latest android security update, is a very good reasonably up-to-date secure phone. my bottomline recommendation still stands to say this Huawei Mate SE is definitely a great phone very much worth getting. Yet Another PS (04/17/2018): GSMARENA indicates that Huawei Honor 7x to get EMUI 8, based on Android 8, to officially roll out with final release in May 2018. so maybe beta testing of Android 8 & EMUI 8 for Huawei Mate SE will occur sometime thereafter? could be looking at June/July for official final release on Huawei Mate SE is my current guess?? we'll see.... meanwhile, me currently still very happy with my Huawei Mate SE. oh, an app tip for those who use their Huawei Mate SE in the car: if you need a car app for playing your music and handling your calls & texts while driving, myself using the DRIVEMODE free app (found in the google play store). imho, it's better than Android Auto. can activate & turn off Drivemode from notifications, and overlay Drivemode on top of the music app, plus easy swipes & taps to control my tunes, and big buttons for answering calls & texts as well as voice control to answer calls and to read/answer texts. (oh, with the overlay, you may want to fully increase screen brightness & turn off the eye comfort.) drivemode works great with my whatsapp also. and particularly, the bigger controls (swipe or tap anywhere on the screen) makes it easy to manage my music tunes while driving, kinda sorta like on my old iphone, but different & better on my Huawei Mate SE which is usually docked on the dashboard of my car when me out driving. hope you all are enjoying your Huawei Mate SE (or soon will be if you are looking to get one). Still Yet Another PS (05/09/2018): there are discussion messages over on XDA-Developers that indicate an Over-The-Air update to Android 8.0 is being pushed out in batches to Huawei Mate SE. the batches are apparently randomly sent out and so you may not get it right away. still hasn't shown up on mine yet. sounds like minor changes, but have to wait to see. good luck and enjoy your Huawei Mate SE. PS Update (May 11, 2018): finally got the Android 8.0 & EMUI 8.0 update. see attached picture. if you have a Huawei Mate SE, you should also be getting this update. yes, this is the phone worth getting. Thanks, Huawei! ADDENDUM: after updating to Android 8.0 (EMUI 8.0), some apps like Swarm, Yelp, weather apps, etc may not show maps inside those apps and may instead state an error message stuck on saying: Google Play Services are updating. you have to clear the data for Google Play Services in the settings app. Settings > Google > Location > Google Play services > Storage > and then clear both Cache (Clear Cache) and Data (Manage Data > Clear All Data) -- and that should fix the maps inside apps.",594,"HUAWEI"

"116","B0791VS3N9",5,"true","Well, I am a very experienced Techie type and I was looking on Amazon for a 64 GB Internal storage with 256GB external SD Card Capabilities and close to 6 inch Android Unlocked Phone. Before I purchased this phone (in the Gold color), I read all the specs and made sure it would work with my AT&T LTE Data plan, Texting, Phone calls and also my home WiFi. And It works fine for my WiFi and Data needs. *My goal in this review is to help you with your decision of whether or not to purchase this phone. Please note that this review reflects my personal opinions and experience with this phone.* PROS: 1) 64GB of Internal Storage...however after the OS and Factory Apps, it had 51gb left. After I installed lots of personal Apps such as Word and Excel (free from Playstore) and several weather apps, Facebook, Twitter and Kindle, I have 46.84gb left. Plenty left if I want to install more apps or updates on apps. 2) 4G/LTE Data/Hot Spot Info. I have a ATT Data plan so I tested for 4G/LTE on an app and it verified that I have 4G/LTE. My LTE data is very fast and works perfectly when I out of a WI-FI area. The data hotspot worked great as I tested this on other devices. 3) Android OS---My phone arrived with Oreo 8.0 pre-installed. And it runs flawlessly! 4) WiFi and Bluetooth abilities: My WiFi Router is a ATT UVERSE 2Wire model (not a 5 Ghz). The WiFi connected immediately to this phone and it is a very fast WiFi, I tested the speed of the WiFi using an app WiFi Analyzer Pro, it tested at 72 mbps. So I am very pleased with this. Also, the WiFi is super strong and I receive 5 bars around my home and it keeps the strong connection even in my backyard. * Bluetooth...So I setup a Bluetooth speaker and Bluetooth headset, both connected wonderfully to this phone. I kept the Bluetooth speaker on and played music while WiFi was connected. Both did fine and my WiFi worked well and had a very strong signal.* ***If you later on buy a 5GHZ Router, make sure that is DUAL BAND and auto switchable to 2.4GHZ. Some of the higher end Routers have dual band/switchable 5GHZ/2.4GHZ. The newer, high end Routers auto switch ( make sure it is setup for this). This way it allow the 2.4GHZ Devices to connect to 2.4 GHZ band and the newer 5 GHZ devices can connect to the the 5 GHZ band. I have researched 5 GHZ/2.4 GHZ Routers thoroughly as I hope to purchase a new Dual band 2.4 GHZ/5 GHZ Router in a few months..this way, I can connect any device to the WIFI. However, right now my 2.4 GHZ AT&T Uverse Router is fast and my phone gets 4 bars of WIFI even in my large backyard, 2.4 GHZ band has a longer distance than the 5GHZ band. I prefer the 2.4 GHZ band over the 5 GHZ band because I need a longer distance because I am in a large house and need to connect to WIFI in any room I want to, even outside in my yard). And the 2.4 GHZ connects well with a great speed. 5) Display---The almost 6 inch (5.93 inch) display is very, very clear and colors vivid as it has 407 PPI sharpness, super sharp and the colors are vibrant! Reading on the Internet, Kindle book or PDF Book, the text is very crisp. The videos in YouTube are very clear as well. 6) Speed and Performance--I use Word, Excel, Facebook, Twitter, Internet, YouTube, Email, etc. I do not play games on this phone yet I found all videos run very well. Performs well, no lagging and no freezing. 7) WiFi calling---Huawei does NOT have ACTUAL WIFI CALLING on this phone. I have a Google Hangouts account and Google assigned me a number. For me to call on WiFi, I use my GOOGLE VOICE PHONE NUMBER, which is different from my cellphone SIM CARD number. Note that I use Google Hangouts on my non cellular Tablet sometimes to make a ""WiFi"" phone call. 8) External Slot for SD Card---So I installed a SanDisk 128gb Micro SD card which was loaded with my music, pictures, home videos and files. I still have 75 gb left on my SD Card. According to Gsmarena, this device holds up to 256 GB Micro SD card. 9) Camera---I actually took some inside and outside pictures and saved them to my SD Card. The pictures (indoors and outdoors) are very clear, excellent for sending in email or even Facebook. My videos also came out well. 10) Battery life and Device Coolness---Battery life I find excellent and I am a heavy user of apps. I watch lots of YouTube videos, Facebook, listen to my music etc. My battery starts off at 100 percent, then after one hour of heavy use it shows close to 90 percent. So I am pleased. ***Device coolness/Battery coolness---The battery temp is usually at 77F to 86F, but after downloading say several books on my Kindle app, it will reach 95F, then go right back down to 86F. I use Battery Solo Widget free from the Playstore. 11) Printing documents on this phone. So I installed PrinterShare app from Playstore. Using the SHARE option in Word, Excel and many other apps, I print right from this phone as it prints on my HP Wireless printer. No need to get on my laptop to print! 12) Sound Clarity: I use 2 types of headsets, the wired type and the Bluetooth type. When I use a wired headset, it has good quality. And when I use my older Bluetooth headset it als o sounds great. Personally, I find the sound on this phone using a headset or Bluetooth speakers is excellent. And I listen to music, videos often with this phone. Also the phone call clarity is excellent as well, both on SPEAKERPHONE or using the phone by my ear. 13) USB Port is MICRO not a type C. However it does have OTG (On the Go), which means with a USB/Micro adapter, you can insert a USB Flash drive, USB mouse, keyboard (one at a time). I use this to copy files from my Flash drive to my phone or vice versa). Cons...Three cons: 1) USB Port is MICRO not a type C. However, I was happy because I have several MICRO chargers. No need to buy a new Type C one as my spare charger. 2) NO 5GHZ WiFi receiver. Since I have an older router without 5ghz, this is not a problem for me. *If you have a 5ghz router, you may want to consider another phone that has 5ghz capabilities. 3) NO NFC...This I was aware of and I do not use this feature anyway. If you need to use NFC, then this phone would NOT be the best choice for you. Note that I am rating this 4.5 stars, rounded off to 5 stars because this phone has 64gb internal, huge screen with superb clarity and this a beautiful phone that is reasonably priced, yet looks expensive. Would I buy this phone again? Yes, because of the very large screen, 64gb internal space and great price. ***Thank you for reading my review. I hope that it has helped you in your decision of whether or not to purchase this phone.*** Since I am a techie type, ask me questions if you like.",2,"HUAWEI"
"117","B0791VS3N9",5,"true","I've been on iPhone since before 3g. It's been my only smartphone OS I've ever known. With iPhone prices climbing every year I started to reevaluate my position. I saw Android users have so many phone options whereas my only options were, ""do I want a bigger screen?"" or ""do I want to buy an older phone?"" I did a lot of research and asked around and finally decided that I should switch. The next part was the phone: So many options. I was concerned that if I got a sub-standard phone, it would otherwise taint my evaluation of the Android OS. I was also concerned though that I would spend $600+ on a phone and I wouldn't windup liking Android. After more research I decided on this phone, the Huawei Mate SE (I still have to look at the phone for the spelling). My thoughts were that for this price point, I could evaluate the OS and if I didn't like it, I'm not out much after a phone resell and if I did like it, I'm not out much to buy a more mainstream Droid phone. Thoughts on my purchase: I love this phone. I am coming from an iPhone 6 and everything is phenomenally better. I'm sure I could have gotten a new iPhone __ and also had an improved experience but again, that costs a lot more $$ than I just spent here. I love the OS. There is a bit of a learning curve but after a couple of weeks, things make sense. The Android operating system offers so much more flexibility in it's settings and features. Things are in intuitive places so I am not digging through menu options to find things or having to use a search feature to find anything (coughcoughWindows10cough). I've have been keeping a Pros and Cons list and so far, most of my Cons are trivial things that even if I did use on iPhone, I don't mind them not being there for the sake of all the other Pros. In Summary: If you are not HEAVILY tied to all things Mac and are looking for a phone to test the waters of Android OS, this is your phone. If you are tired of shelling out $500-800 for a phone that you feel the need to throw more money at for insurance/protection plans, this is your phone. If you think that the ""notch"" in the front screen looks terrible and is a trend you hope fails, this is your phone. If you want to buy a new phone that you don't have to finance like you're buying a car, this is definitely your phone.",82,"HUAWEI"
"118","B0791VS3N9",5,"true","Nothing even close to the overall quality, performance and features at this price point that I have found. Many people have written extensively about the features and pros/cons, so I'll just summarize my review with ratings based on what I think is a value at this price, with 10 being best value around. I don't have an iPhone 8 or X or Google Pixel to compare it to, but I do have an iPhone 6. These are my ratings after about 1 month of steady use: Display: 8 - Not as good as the retina display, some barely visible pixellation on text, but images look great. Viewing at angle reveals limitations. The large size and small bezel make up for it. Sound: 8 - Good quality for music, headphone output is detailed and powerful. Just a hint of hissiness on calls. Speakers are just OK. Speed: 10 - The only thing that slows it down is resource intensive video games. Opening apps, running tasks are all lightning fast. Build Quality: 10 - At least from the outside. Looks and feels very solid and well made. Buttons are responsive, connectors are solid. Weight: 8 - It is a bit heavy for a phone of this size, but that seems to reflect the build quality rather than clunkiness. Stability: 10 - No issues so far - I carry it around everywhere, no random sluggishness, no app freezes, etc. Boots up very fast. Interface/GUI: 9 - The EMUI is good enough for what I need and I've arranged my apps for quick access. Battery: 10 - This is where this phone really shines - I could probably go 3 days without charging under normal use, but I'm not a heavy user. Bloat: 9 - There's not much extra stuff loaded and what is there can be turned off or ignored and doesn't seem to drain resources. Fingerprint Sensor: 10 - If I could give this an 11 I would. I never thought a fingerprint sensor could add so much convenience but now I am spoiled. It makes the iPhone 6 sensor seem sluggish. Camera: 9 - The resolution is very high, but the photos are just OK. Better than most phones at this price. Images tend to be somewhat grainy when zoomed. Seems that Huawei decided to go for max detail at the cost of a slight harshness to images. Camera is not very good in low light. Memory/Storage: 10 - With 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage, I've got plenty of room to load apps and handle the next version of Android OS. WiFi/Bluetooth: 9 - WiFi seems fast enough and Bluetooth connected without issues to even my cheapest no-name devices, and remains stable. Mobile Data and Phone: 9 - Get a solid 4-5 bars with T-Mobile in my area - at least as good as my iPhone, and remains stable. WiFi connection works well and is reliable. Maybe not the fasted around, but good enough. Overall rating - 5 Stars Summary: Best phone I have ever had at this price *by far*.",208,"HUAWEI"

"179","B079PS2HZM",5,"false","I was able to get this for $49.99 during Black Friday Sale at Walmart. This is excellent budget phone - comparable to mid-range phone (minus the fingerprint sensor). This phone is also known as ""Elate"" (Cricket) and comes in white. Let me be brief: PROS: 1. WELL MADE. When you pick it up, you will see silver metal casing on the back that is smooth and elegant. In the front, curbed Gorilla glass 3 protects the screen from scratches and bumps (but of course, you still want the screen protector). It feels solid with no loose parts. 2. SNAPDRAGON 435 (octa-core). In this price range, most of the phones come with Snapdragon 425 quad-core (Moto E4, ZTE Blade Spark) or 427 quad-core (Moto E4 Plus). SD 435 is clearly better in performance over Moto E4 or E4 Plus. I also own Moto E4, and SD 435 is faster in every way. It is snappy and fast. The apps load fast and armed with 2GB RAM you could do multitasking with ease. 3. CAMERA. 12MP (rear) and 8MP (front) give you from decent to very good pictures. With many modes (swipe from left) and settings (swipe from right) for the camera, you can easily take a great shot of your choice. Both cameras come with LED flash, so low light will not be a problem. It also comes with SLOW MOTION video capability. I was actually surprised by this inclusion. And it does work well. 4. CALL QUALITY. The call quality is better than I expected (and better than E4). It was clear and loud without distortion. 5. BATTERY LIFE. With 4000 mAh, you do not have to worry about whether you have enough battery life left at the end of the day. I was able to use full day and a half with 6 hours of screen time. 6. WORKS WITH POSTPAID AT&T and H2O WIRELESS. If you are an AT&T or H2O customer, you can just pop in your SIM card, it would work, you do not need to unlock the phone. However, if you use H2O, you need to manually set APN for internet and MMS. You can find the settings by Googling it. I am using it with H2O. CONS: 1. NO FINGER PRINT SENSOR. This is a glaring omission. Moto E4, E4 Plus, and ZTE Blade Spark - all have fingerprint sensors. So you have to unlock the screen good old fashioned way (PIN, Pattern, or Passwords). But I rather have SD 435 without fingerprint sensor than SD 425 with fingerprint sensor. 2. NO ADOPTIVE STORAGE. Even though it comes with 16GB internal storage, after Android OS and EMUI skin, you will only have about 7 GB available for your apps. This limitation remains because you CANNOT use Micro SD card as adoptive storage. Rather it is only for music, pictures, and videos. Therefore IF you NEED more internal storage, you must move on from this model. 3. NO NOUGAT 7.1.1. It comes with Nougat 7.0. Moto E4, E4 Plus, ZTE Blade Spark all come with 7.1.1 out of the box. Not a deal breaker, but it would have been better if it was the latest Nougat. NEUTRAL: 1. EMUI 5.1. Personally I prefer near stock Android (like Moto E4 - thus you have more internal storage), but I also found this skin very charming. What I mean is that, its iPhon-ish skin will attract many users who want their phones to behave like iPhone. Some features are clearly an eye-candy but it does not slow down your system. EMUI 5.1 is certainly more polished than previous versions. 2. SCREEN RESOLUTION. Almost ALL budget phones that come with 5.5"" screen have 720 x 1280. So I am fine with this, but the screen is bright so it is pleasant to the eyes. All in all, this is a great phone for customers who do not want expensive phones, but something that is inexpensive yet provides quality, performance, and aesthetic phone.

My cheeks hit the keys so I try to just use speaker phone but then the other end has a hard time hearing me. Notifications don't work well. They often disappear. Certain picture and video messages will not send/receive. These are the most common frustrations I have. But overall, for the price it's a decent phone for basic purposes.

"223","B079PS2HZM",5,"false","bought this phone during cyber week 2017 after thanksgiving for about fifty bucks from walmart. already had a gift card, and so my bottomline cost was like thirty bucks including the sales tax. now have had the phone for like two months. this is a good phone. got this phone because apple screwed up my iphone with the iOS 11 nonsense screwing up iphone batteries. awful. but fortunately, this huawei ascend xt2 is an android with its EMUI 5.1 (based on android 7) that is an OS that is reminiscent of the iphone iOS. it's still android, but with its customization features, you can set up the phone to look more like what you have on iphone. for instance, you can turn off the android app drawer. this phone is a great really affordable phone. it reminds me of the iphone 7 with the metal back. wish the back camera was in the corner like on iphone, but you will get used to the back camera being in the middle. and the at&t logo on the back is very nice if you are a person like me who misses the apple logo in the middle top of the back. there is an earphone jack but it is at the top left of the phone -- wish it was at the bottom of the phone but the top left earphone jack is like where it is on the old iphone 4/4s. there is no fingerprint scanner, but the next best thing for quick unlocking of the lockscreen is to use a quick pattern unlock. you can access the camera from the lockscreen. that is set up similar to iOS (pre-iOS11) with a quick swipe up from the bottom right corner. no android lockscreen icon nonsense. one thing that was not pleasing to my eye is the ""HUAWEI"" brandname in the bottom ""chin"" of the front screen. really hate seeing that. so bought one of those metal rectangular home button stickers that you put on samsung phones and used that metal home button sticker to cover up the ""HUAWEI"" brandname. looks pretty nice now imho. the camera works surprisingly well. comparable to iphone, but you could probably be picky and say that of course the iphone camera is better. yet the camera on this phone is much better than cameras on the other android phones in my collection. myself am very pleased with the camera on this phone and you may be also. the one area with this phone that is limited is the 16gb storage. there is some bloatware on this phone like something like some sort of final fantasy game(?) (cannot remember the game's name now) and some other apps. but you can delete some of the bloatware apps to free up some storage space. there will be apps that you cannot delete. and so you will have to be selective and stingy as to what new apps that you install on the phone. do get a microSD card for this phone and set that as the default storage, but that would primarily be for pictures, video, music, and documents. just get in the habit of storing your data to the SD card. also you may find yourself getting into the habit of purging the cache files on the phone using the device-help app on the phone because you may find the phone internal storage getting full. for me, currently have a comfortable 1.12gb storage empty in internal storage. that is kinda of tight but that's why you need to get a SD card. have a 32gb microSD card on mine. you can put in a 128gb SD card if you want to spend some extra bucks. now, even though this has 2gb ram memory, this phone can get really sluggish after particularly using the chrome browser for a while. so you may find yourself killing apps every so often. in the settings, in the battery section, you can have the phone automatically close apps after you lock the phone. but you may still end up killing all open apps every so often by clicking the overview button at the bottom of the homescreen and then clicking the trash button to clear all apps from ram memory. this phone came with the at&t sim card installed in the phone. you can take that out if you already have a working at&t sim card from your old phone, but you may have to call at&t to assign your current working sim with your phone number to work with the imei of the new phone. yes, you can put your existing working at&t sim card in this phone, but it will most likely stop working, and whenever you try to call anyone, you will then be connected with at&t customer service who will ask you to send (email) a copy of your purchase receipt for the phone. had originally ordered my phone via the walmart website and so just forwarded a copy of the order confirmation to the at&t guy on the phone, and they transferred my already working at&t sim to work on this new phone. if you get this phone here on amazon, be prepared to possibly need to forward a copy of your amazon order confirmation email to whomever you may end up talking to at AT&T customer service. it's easy. they'll tell you to forward that order confirmation to a specific email address and to put your phone number in the subject field. if you are instead on an at&t mvno like airvoice, or h2o, or even have the freedompop at&t LTE sim, those should work as is without any other intervention requiring customer service. it's if you want to use AT&T Prepaid (gophone) or postpaid AT&T that you may end up talking to AT&T customer service to sort things out. or if you want to start new, meaning you do not already have a sim that you want to transfer, then keep the new sim that came with the phone in the phone and sign up to get a new at&t number. note that if you want to unlock this phone, you can do so after six months of using this phone on AT&T and you can then go to an AT&T webpage to get the phone unlocked for free. one other thing to note is this phone does not come with a case or a screen protector. well, it had one of those plastic screen covers that you have to take off after you open up the box. but if you have ever bought chinese phones, they typically come with a clear TPU case and screen protector already on the phone. this phone does not come with either. if you want those, you can buy them here on amazon such as this nice TPU clear cover case and this tempered glass screen protector or these regular film screen protectors to put on your phone. oh, there are no earphones included with this phone -- so use what you already have or buy a new pair. also, another note, since myself coming from iphone, needed substitute apps that were equivalent to iphone’s imessages and find-my-iphone and find-my-friends. well, on android, can use whatsapp for messaging, and can use find-my-device and Life360 — all found in the google play store. happy with this phone. but now also considering getting the Huawei HONOR 7X which would be an upgrade, but some negatives about the Honor 7X are that the Honor 7X has a problematic bluetooth that screws up the WiFi and the Honor 7X cannot handle 5Ghz WiFi according to some reviews. In comparison, this Huawei Ascend XT2 is compatible with 5Ghz WiFi (capable of doing super fast 100+ mbps) and has good bluetooth. so, then the Honor 7X negatives make me think that this Huawei Ascend XT2 has better value at a lesser price. may still get the Huawei Honor 7X but personally am still very pleased with this Huawei Ascend XT2. take it from me as a diehard iphone user who has become disappointed by apple, if you want a good affordable quality android phone, and if you do not want to pay through the nose for a new iphone, then getting a Huawei phone like this one may be for you like it is for me.",14,"HUAWEI"

"279","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","It is the best phone I've ever owned and a valid alternative to other flagships by Samsung and Google. I have no regrets. Buy this phone. Where it wins out: Design - This baby is not only beautiful, it just feels right in your hand. People keep on asking me, ""What is that?"" It screams ""Quality"". Battery - It is a beast that lasts all day long. Fast charging - With the supplied adapter, it charges amazingly fast. Fingerprint Sensor - Nothing is this fast or accurate. Price - Just barely now, but I got the 150 gift card during pre-release. Where it is comparable to the others: Speed - They all are fast enough. Camera/Videos - The Pixel is better, but not by much. I am loving the black and white camera. Call quality - Excellent. MUCH better than Samsung. Speakers - Not as nice as the Pixel, but still much better than most. Display Quality - It does not have as high a resolution as the others, but it really doesn't matter. It looks better to me than the Pixel 2 XL's screen does. It has an extremely bright and beautiful display. Where it is quirky: EMUI 8 - I am enjoying the interface, it is certainly much better than TouchWiz. Lots of setting options that you will either love or hate. It takes some time to learn. It is one of the few Android phones that I haven't felt the need to install Nova Launcher on to correct deficiencies with the launcher it ships with. Many of the setting are genuinely useful and an improvement over standard Oreo. SmartLock implementation is missing - Bluetooth unlock seem to work fine, but why doesn't it stay unlocked by location or have face unlock like other Huawei phones? I thought I might miss these, but the fingerprint unlock works so well, I haven't missed it at all. What it is missing that matters to me: Accessories - I bought several cases to try a variety of them. The one I ended up using is made by Huawei, but I haven't seen it sold here in the US yet. Search for Huawei Mate 10 Pro Car Kit CF80. Also, there are too many fake Huawei OEM fast chargers out there. Buy the one sold and shipped by Amazon to get an authentic one. What is missing that might matter to you: WiFi calling - It is not supported on T-Mobile. I have great coverage where I am, so it doesn't matter to me. No SD card - 128GB internal is plenty for me.",19,"HUAWEI"
"280","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","I might lower my rating in the future the lack of updates in the US doesn't seem to nice for the price people paid for the phone. The phone also crashes a lot so we're stuck with bugs still. It's pretty fast though not as fast as a Samsung their ui is seriously fast in comparison. Please improve the phone so I can buy more in the future if not I may not buy more of these in the future. I had good support and updates with the honor 7x...so I'm rethinking now... Also it had a better camera something about the coloration was better maybe a more modern lense but paying 700 for a lack luster photo colors and no update or support it not nice.They updated it once and I want the brand to be successful/",6,"HUAWEI"
"281","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","Unlike most of my purchases, I pre-ordered this on a whim, without doing much research on the available international version. I have been an Android (read Samsung) user for a long time and based on usage of just one week, I can say that this phone easily knocks them out of the park and then some. It has great battery life (1.5 days in moderate-to-heavy use), 97 rated DxOMark camera, snappy and fast processor, excellent call and network quality (tested on T-Mobile), less bloatware than Samsung or a carrier sold device (thank god in heaven, its unlocked), & an overall beautiful design. It has it's fair share of shortcomings too for a ""Pro"" model, like no wireless charging, no face unlock, no 3.5mm audio jack, no micro SD slot, no Daydream support (yet). EMUI didn't bother me much, as I got used to it in a few days (just as I got used to Touch wiz on Samsung).

Only thing I wish I knew before hand was about the audio jack for headphones, but I should have seen that myself when I was looking at it before I bought it. The jack they give you to use that plugs into the charger port works well and there have been no issues.

Mainly apps that use google maps. Problem extends to Huawei phones only. A beta version fixes the issue. Final should be released soon. GPS, Bluetooth and wifi are very fast.

Yeah EMUI is a tad bid dated, but nothing Nova Launcher can't fix. The first week battery life was kinda meh, but after a week it REALLY turned around. On my old Pixel I would usually leave work after a 12 hour shift on about 30% with excellent signal coverage while listening to music and watching videos on break occasionally. With this thing, I do all that and more and leave with 60% battery which is just insane. Although it doesn't have a headphone jack, it kicks it pretty decent sound with a nice pair of USB C headphones. It's quick, responsive, and gorgeous to look at. I'm still learning how to work the camera, so far I've gotten decent shots but it's still not comparing to the 1st Gen Pixel camera, but it's almost there when I figure out how to handle exposure in the pro mode.

However, I suffered some IOS issues when Apple launched the updated IOS. Every 2 weeks, there was an update to fix IOS bugs. It took 2 months for all my IOS issues to be fixed. Don't get me wrong, iPhone X is a great phone, but I'm bored with it. My sister has been using Huawei Mate series for couple of years, and she loved it (she was also an iPhone user before). Therefore, I decided to give it a try. I love how this phone functions. It is fast. Camera is good. I just need to get used to how Android operates. I'm very satisfied with this phone. I do not have connectivity issues with AT&T like couple of other users did. This phone charged very fast. When I received it yesterday, it had around 55% of battery life. I was playing with it for 6 hours to set it up, install apps, rearrange the apps, update my contacts, and transfer pics and music to this new phone. Before I went to bed, it still had 20% battery life. It was amazing!!!!! Also, I got Midnight Blue one, and it is SOOOO pretty in person.

One negative because no headphone jack you can't charge it and use the headphone at the same time. I'm not too worried about the Chinese spying on me with the US government making wild allegations without any proof.

"354","B07C6FCC8G",5,"false","This phone has been great so far. I honestly can't think of one thing about it so far that I don't like. I'm not saying it's perfect for everyone, as it doesn't have every feature that a Samsung Note or Galaxy has, but it's blazing fast, the battery life is as amazing as the reviews say it is, and the camera is very good. The build quality, design, and software features all give it a high end vibe, and the lower screen resolution compared to the Samsungs really doesn't matter. This screen looks amazing, and the trade-off in battery life is worth it, in my opinion. Lastly, I personally am finding EMUI to be a fine iteration of Android on this device. I came from a near stock version and I actually prefer this, and I think this UI plays a big role, along with the AI, in making the battery life something special. I'm a big fan of Windows Phone, and I'm sad that it didn't catch on, as my two Nokia Lumia phones operated absolutely flawlessly, in a way that Android never has for me, but this phone feels like it has a chance to be the one that I've been looking for. Anyway, I know I've been gushing a bit, but this phone really is that nice. November 2019 update: Still using this phone, and it's still flawless. Best phone that I ever owned. Battery life continues to be outstanding, and this is the first time ever that an Android phone has not developed ""quirky behavior"" for me over time. I love getting new phones.

"357","B07C6FCC8G",4,"true","I've had this phone 1 day so this is more of a first impression review on the phone. I bought this phone because it was cheap and my LG G6 broke. What I love: big screen, stereo speaker, battery life. Dislike: Emui, screen seems kind of washed out at the lowest brightness setting, no headphone jack. I haven't really tested out the camera so I can't say anything about it. Coming from my LG G6 the mate 10 pro is definitely a step up. It doesn't have an always on display or knock to wake, which I didn't know I would miss until I didn't have it anymore. The mate 10 pro does have lift to wake but i personally prefer knock to wake. The screen does seem washed out at low brightness and my g6 actually looks more vibrant I'm not sure if this is a defect with my screen but I will contact Huawei to ask. One other thing is that the USB to 3.5mm adapter fits really snugly into the USB port which is both a good thing and bad thing because when I go remove it I feel like I will rip the adapter, that I have to say doesn't feel well made. Overall I am happy with my purchase UPDATE: I received my replacement and the screen is so much better than the one I first received. The colors are nice and vivid not washed out like the first one I received. I also found the always on display setting though it is named something else. The lift to wake feature is a bit finicky sometimes so I hope I can find the settings to turn that off.",4,"HUAWEI"

"365","B07C6FCC8G",3,"true","***SPOILER ALERT: I returned the phone*** --------------------------- PROs: --------------------------- First off... this device is BEAUTIFULLY crafted. Built quality is top notch, no doubt. Secondly the battery... wow. The battery is excellent, I had to try REALLY hard to drain it. Will last you a day and a half easy (with modest/average usage) -- I social media'ed on it, surfed the web, emailed, online shopped, YouTube'd, played a game here and there, and the battery held up really really well. Third, the screen. It's only an FHD+, rather than a QHD (like Samsung/LG/Pixel), but it's a wonderful screen. I came from a Samsung Galaxy S7 with the QHD screen, and the FHD+ screen on the Mate 10 Pro was just as vibrant. Blacks were pitch black, colors vibrant and viewing angles were all stellar. You won't miss having a QHD screen. Great OLED. Fourth, the Kirin 970 and 6GB of RAM performed like a champ. Opened tons of apps side by side with my Galaxy S7 with a Exynos 8890 and 4GB of RAM, and the Mate 10 Pro opened apps faster and kept more apps in memory than my S7. Fifth, the Cameras... The cameras on the back were great. Quick to focus, sharp as a tack. Portrait mode was nice too, although I did find it to incorrectly miss blurring some background or blur some foreground. At a glance the portrait mode photos look beautiful. But when you zoom in closer to see what's actually going on you see some of the mistakes the bokeh/portrait software make. The front camera is okay, nothing to write home about. The front camera on my S7 was better and had a wider angle. Finally, the price was on point, for $499 USD (~$730 CAD after taxes -- that how much I ended up paying in Canadian), you get a great quality handset, awesome specs, and the fact it comes with a screen protector pre-installed AND a clear gel case was a nice touch. --------------------------- CONs: --------------------------- 1. No headphone jack 2. No wireless charging 3. No location based Smart Unlock!!!! -- This is a stock Android feature... EMUI took this feature out! :( 4. Location Based Smart Unlock via bluetooth is very spotty -- the only Smart Unlock option available. 5. With the fingerprint sensor on the back, there's no double tap to wake which means you have fiddle to find the power button the side (annoying if it's mounted in the car) 6. Notifications on the lock screen work oddly -- can't expand and they disappear once you see them even though you don't action on them. 7. Future software updates are a concern, as it already misses out on the Face Unlock and GPU Turbo while other regions have already got this update or have it scheduled. The North America version of the Mate 10 Pro, is not even on Huawei's release schedule. --------------------------- My Deal Breaker: --------------------------- Given this phone has the finger print sensor on the back, I can't unlock it while it's sitting on the table or mounted in the car, without having to put in my pattern/pin. Okay... so i tried to get around this by using the Smart Unlock feature -- but their Smart Unlock feature is limited to being paired with a Trusted Bluetooth device... okay, so I tried pairing it with my Smart Watch. And the Unlock worked... but only sometimes... then I'd have to re-pair the device. Since I use the phone a lot in my car while it's mounted, there's no convenient way for me to turn it on (no front sensor or double tap to wake) and no reliable way for it to automatically unlock because of the spotty Bluetooth. In the end... there were a few things I was gonna settle for that weren't ideal, but the BLUETOOTH was the dagger in the heart. Deal breaker! :( --------------------------- Verdict --------------------------- Would I recommend this phone? Totally if the cons, particularly to do with the software and the bluetooth, aren't a major concern or deal breakers for you. Mate 20 Pro will be out soon, maybe the Mate 10 Pro will drop even further in price.",4,"HUAWEI"

"371","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","I never used iPhone before, but my wife and daughter use iPhone. I had Nexus 5x, 6 before. They always laugh at me about the screen color and picture quality. But finally, there is a phone I can show them the beauty from this phone and the camera. The build quality of this phone is top notch, so much better than my last phone, Nexus 6. The camera is the best I ever had too. Image quality is great. Needless to say the 20MB monochrome lens generates unbeatable B/W photo. I watched quite a few YouTube review. Mostly they complain about wireless charge and the software interface. First, I don't care about wireless charging. I used to use on my Nexus 6 phone once in awhile, but it's slow and very hot. I was always afraid it will melt my screen off one day. Secondly, the interface is great IMHO. The US version mightve been upgraded from the time other youtubers reviewed the phone. It's very close to the default google Android interface. Nothing like iOS. Many apps are grouped together. App drawer is there out of box. You can add widgets onto the screen like any other Android phone. I always have a calendar widget on a whole screen, which is a must. IOS can never do that. The private space is fantastic if you want have a separate interface for your kids or friends. This phone has IR which is great. I don't have to search for my remotes anymore. I use this phone to control my TV, Blu-ray and home theater. I did the preorder and only had the phone for several days. If anything changes, I will post in the future.",5,"HUAWEI"

"373","B07C6FCC8G",3,"true","I've had the phone for just over a year now. The updates are regular and appreciated. The battery is still going strong. But for whatever reason despite having all the frequency bands, my T-Mobile service is terrible with this phone. There are older phones that I've tried and retried, and they give better service and hotspot strength. I'm not sure what the problem is and I've had all my settings reset and looked at by a T-Mobile rep. As far as lasting impressions, I think my next phone will have to include a jack. It's been a hastle wrestling for a charger vs a headphone plugin and attaching converters for my regular jacks to work. The phone is good but next time I'll stick with one that is carried and approved by my service carrier.",3,"HUAWEI"
"374","B07C6FCC8G",2,"true","A VERY Beautiful Brick This is a very beautiful paperweight. It excels at everything EXCEPT actually being a phone. I'll provide a quick summary for people who just want the overview then go into detail below. As an FYI - I replaced the first phone after three weeks. Called in to return the second after 4 days. PROS Speedy. Responsive. Beautiful. CONS Can't maintain a Bluetooth connection. Can't maintain a call over Wi-Fi. Can't maintain a call over cellular. Can't receive calls. Transferring apps and data to the phone does not work well. Only partially transferred data, then stopped working. Piss poor customer support. Does not come with visual voicemail installed. Here's the message I sent to HUAWEI about the details. These messages were after the calls. DETAILS Phone #1 - 1) the phone clone app does not connect. Getting a connection so I can copy the contents of my other phone over where painful and took forever. Does not work as advertised. 2) Dropped Bluetooth connections and would during calls, people would complain of not being able to hear me. Even though I could hear them. Then they'd hang up. Because they couldn't hear me. 3) would lose internet connection. Customer support would only tell me to factory reset or send phone in to be serviced. So I would either lose my data. Or have people not be able to contact me for a week. I returned this phone to Amazon and got a new on on Friday (March 16th). Phone #2 - 1) loses internet connection. Even though it says it's connected to the internet it loses internet connection. 2) after several minutes on the phone, people were complaining of not being able to hear me and then they would disconnect the phone because they thought the phone call had ended.. After unsuccessful attempts to receive help from Huawei support, I was able to determine that calls made over Wi-Fi would be the ones where people complained of not being able to hear me. All of my other phones are able to do this without an issue, but the Huawei phone is unable to handle this. 3). Now this is the BIG ONE. All of a sudden, this phone stopped receiving phone calls. I had very important calls coming in and this phone wouldn't even register that a phone call has been made to me. I can call out just fine (as long as I talk fast enough to get my message out before the phone decides to mute me). But this phone refuses to accept calls now. FYI For both phones, Huawei suggested I reset the phone. Even the one that was fresh out of the box. Only 4 days old. They didn't offer much beyond that. Do not get this phone if you're not already an expert at setup or are new to Android. Or if you need to call people.",8,"HUAWEI"

"390","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","This phone is baller. The monochrome secondary camera is awesome (black and white) and way better than using a black and white filter. It is an actual feature that separates this phone from the pack. The IR blaster is useful. I lost my ac remote and this phone turned it on and it only took me like 5 seconds to figure it out. Same with my grandma's tv, cable box and bedroom smart TV (testing). Went to a donut shop and they had CNN on and I turned off the fake news so I can enjoy my donuts with my daughter. The 4000 mAh battery is awesome. You get two solid days of moderate use. You can turn power saver on and get more milage... I don't recommend ultra power saver but it is a thing... Turns off GPS, autorotate etc.. not sure how much life I would get... I don't seem to get as much NSA, FBI, spying it seems... I had an iPhone before and if I talked about Machu Picchu I would get flight advertising to Peru or if I talked about cruiseships, Bam ad for cruise on my Facebook... This doesn't seem to happen so I guess the Chinese government has nothing to offer me. I can turn the GPS off so that is neat... But Trump is going to decriminalize marijuana so if I ever need medical weed it will probably be legal by then... And I will probably have abother phone. Anyway this phone is awesome. Price came down and for a 2017 flagship it is holding up well to 2018 phones. No jack, no wireless charging. Comes with headphones that plug into the port without adapter and I can't tell the difference between jack and no jack. Wireless charging does eat up the electric bill anyway so I am okay with out it. Phone charges fast and it is not like I need to hit 100% with this thing, 70% is like 100% compared to other phones so that is a thing.",2,"HUAWEI"

I cannot recommend this phone to anyone who values support and timely updates. EDIT: Because of the issues with the government Huawei has shut down their US presence and laid off all US employees. Also, before purchasing ANY Huawei product be advised that NONE of their products have any warranty when sold in the US.

Speaking of updates, I talked with Huawei support and we can expect to NOT receive the GPU Turbo update, though every two months we can probably expect security and other patches. Besides a few issues and no updates, it's a really great phone. Would get five (5) stars if they put North and South America on the same update schedule as the rest of the world.",2,"HUAWEI"
"456","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","I have been using Iphone 4s, Huawei Mate 2, Honor 5X, Huawei Mate 9, Samsung S7 edge in the past. And recently purchased Huawei Mate 10 Pro US edition. I have to admit that this phone is much better than Huawei Mate 9, the camera is way better although Mate 9 also uses Leica lenses. I would say this Mate 10 pro take pictures as good as a mirrorless nikon or sony that sells for $600 or more. The aperture is as good as the prime lens 1.8f can deliver on my Nikon SLR. The other amazing thing of Huawei Mate brand is the battery life. The Samsung S7 edge I owned has 3700 mA battery and the Huawei Mate series uses 4000 mA battery. You would assume that battery life is about the same since 3700mA is almost on par with 4000mA. That is totally wrong. Huawei Mate Series 2/9/10 delivers 2 day plus battery life with 4000mA but Samsung deliver 1 day with 3700mA. It must have to do the battery management optimization done by Huawei. The final thing I would comment is that Huawei have much better signal strength than Samsung. I work on 6th floor of a building no cellular towers nearby, my Samsung S7 consistently have about 1 bar at work and 4 bars at home. But my Huawei Mate 10 pro delivers 3 bars at work and 5 bars at home. I think this is really a great phone if you want to go contract free and knows about what you want. It is sad that Huawei decided to release Mate 20 only in Europe and Asia. This might be the only Mate phone you can buy with US warranty for a short while. The alternative, $1000 phones from Samsung or Apple? I only paid $499 for this Huawei, why should I pay more.",1,"HUAWEI"
"457","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","Great phone. I am very satisfied with it. In fact, I bought two, one for myself and the other for my wife. It takes great photos, has lots of memory, seems sturdy and well made and signal strength is much better on this phone than my previous Iphone. I know it will do a lot of other things I'm not tasking it to do, but hey... I'm 73. I highly recommend it, it is easy to use.",3,"HUAWEI"
"458","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","Seller contacted me immediately after purchase informing me of an address mistake. Immediately correct and they gave confirmation. I received the package on October 29th, my shipping estimate was October 31th-November 5th. The phone is exactly as described, and I am currently waiting for a SIM from T-mobile to arrive, but from what I have seen using apps and messenger, the phone is really good. The battery life is pretty startling as well. I don't download many apps, since all my previous phones die after a few hours, but this phone was able to have continuous heavy load for multiple hours and stay well above 50% while also not heating up to much. The case that it comes with is poor, but that is to be expected. Get yourself new glass protectors as well, since the one that it comes with scratches easily.",NA,"HUAWEI"

It's super fast. It's screen is vibrant. I love it! The whole China Spy thing is a load of garbage perpetuated by the two top phones in the US realizing they had competition.",3,"HUAWEI"
"461","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","One reason I don't love iphone or Samsungs are you see them EVERYWHERE. I wanted a GREAT phone but one that maybe everyone and their Grandmother may not own too. In any case though more import to me though is owning a great phone that is stable, and great for business..which is what I mostly use it for. This Mate10 Pro is awesome, to use an old hippie word! For one thing and oddly almost no pro or youtube type review ever mentions this..is the call qualify! It's OUTSTANDING clear as a bell with a stronger signal than my S8 Plus. As to Bluetooth it connects in milli seconds to several of my bluetooth headsets and unlike my Samsung phones, nobody has ever complained that they can't hear or understand me or I'm breaking up ala my S8 PLus. esp with various bluetooth devices. The screen on the Mate 10 Pro looks just great even outside on a bright day. I suppose many here will not agree I actually LIKE EMUI very much. Yes for sure there are menus in menus and it's actually amazing JUST how much you can do with this phone. I find when I need a feature I simply google how..or youtube it, and I've yet to get stuck wondering HOW do you set this or that. One reason I left iphone a while ago is I felt it was SO limited as to customization. Well EMUI is amazing..in what it can do...in this case I don't think LESS IS more, ala stock android. Anyway just my opinion. As everyone has said the battery life is GREAT / off the charts...you will need smash the phone with a hammer to kill the battery lol. My only gripe oddly enough is I THINK I may have a semi SLIGHTLY defective camera. Everybody raves about the cameras here even DX0 mark. On almost all my photos the left side tends to be a tad blurry. I have to think this is just MY phone, and I may or may not think about an exchange. Oddly monochrome is tack sharp in every corner. I happened to pre-order this phone so at $650 it's a steal. That said I think it can go head to head with any Samsung, or LG or plasticky Pixel, so to me the $799 price or so is fair..though I won't complain I paid $650 for it. I plan to sell my S8-PLUS as I just LOVE this Mate 10 Pro...Addios Samsung!!",29,"HUAWEI"
"462","B07C6FCC8G",2,"true","This phone feels like what could have been the last phone out of Saigon (Vietnam reference, not China.) . It was and is a great phone, but I haven't received any sort of updates in 9 months while on TMobile (I've had the phone since July 2018.) No ways to manually flash or update it either. It also uses AI monitoring for power savings, which is awesome, until I got a Tesla, which uses your phone as a key, and there is no way to get the AI from killing the Tesla apps connection to the bluetooth stack.

"463","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","Was looking at much more expensive devices and happened to catch this Mate 10 Pro on Amazon for $426. New phone that exceeds my expectations.for an outstanding price. Call quality, display, battery life, cameras and sound are excellent. Thanks Amazon... Just an update. I have really enjoyed this device. It is getting consistently 8+ hours of screen on time and usually lasts a couple of days on charge. I am getting used to the EMUI software although I would prefer a more stock Android interface. But all my apps work well, apps are fast and fluid, call and network quality are better than my OnePlus, and the little extras you get with EMUI makes the phone more productive. Camera functions are extensive and fun to experiment. And Huawei has by far the best packaging and freebies in the phone game. Includes a nice set of powered ear buds, pre-installed screen protector, clear case, super charger and beautiful box. Overall a great value.",6,"HUAWEI"

It also comes with a soft protector case, which is one less decision to make, which is really a pleasant experience. The hardware is fast, I play PUBG on it and the load time is fast and game play is smooth on high settings. Battery is also good, I charge it once a day because again, I play PUBG on it, as well as stream quite a bit of music, but usually it doesn't dip below 30% when I do charge.

While the current price seems great, I cannot recommend purchasing this device due to Huawei's indifference to US software updates. Until Huawei changes their attitude toward timely updates, you will be purchasing a still expensive device with already outdated firmware, including security updates and fixes. Hats off to Android Authority for their updating the US Market on the current software situation (something that Huawei has refused to do in the Q & A section): ""Update, 07/16 at 6:44 p.m. EDT: If you live in the U.S. and happen to own a Huawei device on the list below, you’re out of luck.

Design - It feels solid in the hands and I do like the glass back Battery life - Pretty amazing, One of the best out there Camera - Solid shooter Not so good: EMUI - is still a mess, its convoluted. Menus are buried within menus App compatibility - I have found not all apps play nice with EMUI. Also battery optimization is too aggressive that background tasks will close. There is an issue floating around regarding widgets not updating (Huawei said they are looking at this) Wifi Calling - I don't know about ATT but Tmobile does not support Wifi calling on the Mate 10 pro. Huge deal breaker The last thing is the price. For $800 dollars there are much better options You could get a Pixel 2 that has a better camera and software experience. Also up to three years of security and software updates You could get a Samsung S8/S8 plus or on swappa a Note 8 You could save a bit and get a HTC U11 6GB model for $750 You could also save around $300 and get a Oneplus 5T that has a way better software experieince",6,"HUAWEI"
"485","B07C6FCC8G",1,"false","Horrible phone, even worse horrible technical support. Screen dims on any given website unless you have it set to max brightness. At max brightness that massive 4000 mah battery will deplete quickly. No matter the settings, if you go into any given website, perform any given internet search, that screen will automatically dim. This is a well documented issue online WITH NO FIX TO DATE FROM HUAWEI!!! Technical support is, per usual, abysmal. Highly repetitive support that speaks broken English, and has absolutely no clue as to how to address any given issue, let alone the one I am writing about. I used to have a Huawei Mate 9 that was spectacular. At just 50% screen brightness, the screen was stunning and NEVER DIMMED!!!!!!!! I will never again purchase another Huawei phone. Highly unfortunate. Anyone providing a great review on this phone has undoubtedly settled for whatever experience they are having. I am stunned at how little commentary in reviews there is about this dimming issue. AGAIN, just research it and you will see. And by the way, I have read some people say that this is common on Huawei phones. NO, it is not!!! UPDATE: I KEEP GETTING EMAILS FROM HUAWEI APOLOGIZING FOR THE ISSUE OF THE SCREEN DIMMING NO MATTER THE SETTING ON WHATEVER SITE I GO TO, BUT I HAVE CALLED THEM MULTIPLE TIMES AND HAVE EVEN SPOKEN TO SUPERVISORS AND THE SERVICE IS ABSOLUTE TRASH!!! THEY WILL NOT, I REPEAT, WILL NOT SEND OUT A REPLACEMENT UNIT, LOANER, NOTHING!!!!!!!!! ONLY SUGGESTION IS TO SEND IN THE PHONE (WHO TODAY HAS A BACK UP PHONE TO REPLACE THEIR PRIMARY CELL PHONE - I DON'T!!!!!), OR TAKE IT BACK TO WHERE I BOUGHT IT FROM!!!!!! THIS COMPANY IS HORRIBLE. MAYBE IT IS TRUE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAID ABOUT THE SPYING STUFF HERE IN THE U.S. LET'S FACE IT, THERE IS TECHNICALLY NO RETAIL STORE RIGHT NOW SELLING THESE PHONES. EVERYONE HAS STOPPED SELLING THE PHONE. YOU HAVE TO NOW GET A HUAWEI PHONE ONLINE. AGAIN, MY SUGGESTION IS: DO NOT BUY!!!! DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!! UPDATE: WAS CALLED YESTERDAY, AFTER ALMOST 2 FULL DAYS SINCE RETURNING IT BACK TO ORIGINAL RETAILER, AND A TECHNICAL SUPPORT REP TOLD ME THAT HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO SEND ME ANOTHER UNIT BUT OF COURSE THEY WOULD NEED THE DEFECTIVE ONE BACK. TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH INCREDIBLE PROTOCOL CHANNELS BEFORE IT CAN BE DECIDED WHAT TO DO WHEN A CUSTOMER HAS AN ISSUE. ALL THE WHILE YOU ARE WAITING (MOST LIKELY WITHOUT A PHONE, OR A DEFECTIVE ONE AS IN MY CASE). THE GUY TELLS ME HE HAS TO GET BACK IN CONTACT WITH ME AGAIN TO DETERMINE IF HE CAN STILL SEND OUT A REPLACEMENT PHONE SINCE I NOW TOOK BACK THE ONE I HAD. HE NEVER CALLED BACK. I CALLED THIS MORNING 5/12/18. NOW THEY ARE OFFERING A COUPON, A COUPON!!!, FOR WHATEVER I WANT TO USE IT FOR ON THEIR WEBSITE. THIS AFTER THE REP WAS AGAIN SPEAKING BROKEN ENGLISH, AND BEING HIGHLY REPETITIVE REGARDING EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I SAID. I AM CERTAIN THAT HUAWEI WILL DO GREAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY WITH TODAY'S CUSTOMER THAT IS WILLING TO ACCEPT PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING WITH THE HOPE THAT UPDATE, AFTER UPDATE WILL MAKE BETTER THEIR PHONE.

Those other phones were all between $850-$1000 while the Mate 10 pro was $550. You can look up the stats, they are top of the line, incredibly quick with tons of storage. The build quality is very solid, and it's a great looking phone. The camera which was the defining reason for the purchase is just as advertized. The fingerprint scanner is super quick and the shortcut to open the camera app and take a picture while locked takes less than 2 seconds. I wouldn't overthink this purchase, I don't consider $550 cheap, but if you are looking for a high end phone that is blazing fast, has massive storage (128GB) and a great camera I would strongly consider this before you spend twice as much on a Galaxy or Iphone.",2,"HUAWEI"
"490","B07C6FCC8G",4,"true","I recently bought a Mate 10 for personal use. I had previously had the original Samsung note, an S4, a Note 4, a Huawei Honor 7X, Huawei 8, Hoawei Mate 9, and now this. I have never been happy with the reliability of Samsung phones. The Note lost the GPS just past warranty, and the S4 had to be replaced several times for various reasons while under warranty. The Huawei 7X wasn't powerful enough for me, though still a reliable phone. The GPS quit working on the 8 just past warranty. I broke the screen on the 9and had it replaced but they say they can't get factory screens for Huawei phones so they replaced it with an aftermarket screen, which I broke within a few months. They replaced it a couple more time because I could only make them last a couple months at a time. Meaning the non-OEM screens are not gorilla glass or any other break resistant glass. If you buy a Huawei phone be very careful so you don't break the screen. Having said all that, I love this phone! Consumer Reports rated it at 78 points with the Samsung S9 being rated at the top with 81 points and several other Samsung and Apple phones between that and this Mate 10. The deal breakers are that this phone can be had for $500 on Amazon, while the other phones run between $600-1000, and the battery life on this phone is really pretty amazing (As well as on my previous Mate 9). I am a heavy user and it rarely gets below 60% at the end of the day. The camera is pretty sweet, better than the Mate 9, which was good in it's own right. The 'Merican Mate 10 only has one sim slot and no extra slot for memory, though it DID come with 128g of ram and 6 gigs for the operating system. There is literally zero lag ever. They make their own CPU which is probably why they can sell this phone cheaper, rather than having to buy them from the same place the other makers do. See attached photos; One of the lenses is B&W and it's pretty impressive. It's fun to experiment! As for reliability, I'm more impressed with these phones than the ones made by Samsung, more so since they cost half of a comparable Apple or Samsung phone. My Mate 9 still works like a clock even though I drop it about once a day and have broken several screens. I hope this one does as well. Edit: 9-30-3028: There is one downside for Huawei phones in general, and the Mate 10 Pro is no exception. It will not work with Android Auto that is in newer cars, including my 2017 Dodge Charger Daytona. This is my fourth Huawei phone and none of them has worked with AA. I emailed them about this and they sent a curt reply that their phones are not compatible. When queried by news organizations they have stated that they are working on a fix. However, they have been saying this since 2016. Meaning, don't buy a Huawei phone if AA is critical to you because they may never fix it. One star removed for that. Otherwise, it's a great phone.",1,"HUAWEI"

"521","B07C6FCC8G",3,"false","I gave this phone 3 stars because I have only had it for 24 hrs but will update later after several months of use. A little background, I was skeptical about getting this phone not because of the huawei brand, but because of the screen size and lack of desire to change from what I 've been used to. Keep in mind, I had been using a Huawei mate 7 for the past three years with no problems except the once in a while lagging (which you should expect the older a phone gets). What eventually pushed me to 'need' another phone is that the camera on my huawei mate 7 finally gave up. It wouldn't save pictures, I couldn't view images/videos, it was at this point I was forced to buy a new phone. The next closest similar phone to the mate 7 was the mate 9 which unfortunately does not have the EMUI/Android 8 specs of the mate 10 pro. I am sooo used to the mate 7's build, that changing to and accepting the mate 10's build will take a little while to grow on me. So far, in the last 24 hrs, the mate 10 pro has been holding up pretty good as expected. If you are indecisive, watch a lot of youtube videos of the phones you're interested in, and this will help you decide. The only thing I don't like so far is the phone's ability to fall asleep while its still in use, have to figure out how to change that, its probably a power saving thing. Finally, the huawei brand has never disappointed me. My last mate 7 lasted me for a good 3 YEARS, a rarity today in modern phone tech world. And last but not least, my main reason for pursuing huawei in the first place, was because I wanted something different from the usual samsung, iphone, htc, motorola phones that you see everyone with. I just wanted sthing different, and huawei delivers that difference at a great price. Secretly, I was overjoyed they didn't break into the US market like they wanted to bcos then I would have had to look for something else like the one plus phones or google's pixel, which huawei still beats anytime anyday in my opinion. Yay huawei......9 times out of 10, I know i'm the only huawei user in the room and that is enough. 8 month Update... So I have had the phone for about 8 months now and here's what I have noticed so far... The phone's superior battery life is beginning to wane. It started right around the 7 month mark. It does not charge and last all day like it used to. Secondly, the phone goes to sleep mode in mid-use. You can be scrolling through the phone, temporarily get distracted and boom the phone goes off in mid-use... The phone going off in use doesn't bother me as much as the battery life waning. With the battery life beginning to show signs of going downhill, I'm beginning to think it might be time to start thinking of a new phone soon and its not even a year yet...i miss my mate 7...lasted 3 years and I'm still craving for its awesomeness...oh well..technology and life moves on it would seem...",NA,"HUAWEI"

I was made to send my device twice and every time, I reach the customer service, they make me go through all the details starting from imei to asking for device images(This is even after providing my ticket number - and every time I call they give a new ticket number and they loose information between all these tickets. so they ask you to provide all the ticket numbers since you started this warranty claim. They just want to make sure you stop calling them). Even after multiple escalations and follow up they ended up sending the device back without fixing the any of the issues raised. And the worst part is they made a lot of scratches to the device while opening it and are refusing fix it. Now after multiple follow they have blamed it on me staring the scratches existed even when I had sent the device to them for the first time. At this point, though my device is in warranty I am unable to do anything about all these issues. Have filed an FTC complaint and hoping something will turn around. If you end up buying any kind of Huawei device, just pray that you should not end up with a warranty issue which will lead you to deal with their customer service.

"561","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","After using this phone for about a month, I can confirm that this device is an excellent all around camera, a great portable PC and a fast responding phone. Under the PC desktop mode, the device is quite fast thanks to its 8-core CPU and big memory. The processing speed is comparable to a laptop PC. When edit word documents or heavy processing photos, the device responds quickly. The only tricky part is that most USB/HDMI hubs can not charge the phone while in the desktop mode, I have found that only Cable Matters USB hub supports this. I can now use this as a PC without worrying about the phone battery drainage.[ASIN:B0775KJ4C5 Cable Matters USB C Multiport Adapter]. Additionally, if you are left handed, the device does not provide any way to switch the left and right button on the mouse under the desktop mode, however, I have found ISVO mouse that has a hardware switching mode can accommodate this. Hope Huawei can consider left-handed people in its future release. [ASIN:B077PC62DR IVSO Gaming Mouse] As photography is my hobby, I truly like this excellent camera phone. It does not have the extra telephoto lens like iPhone X, but it does have a dedicated black and white lens which provides excellent low light shooting results. I shoot in raw mode and can at least recover about half stop details from the image which is very impressive on this mobile device. As a food lover dinning in a dim-lit restaurant, I was able to shoot the food with great details. Firework photos looks fine too. The most impressive feature for the camera is the resolution, the farm house below is at least one mile away, and the camera is able to resolve the details clearly. Shooting into the sun does not cause too much flare and focus correctly. The white balance is accurate in various lighting conditions. That being said, the default JPG image from the camera is over-sharpened IMO. Additionally, when in raw mode, the device still creates a JPG file which is unnecessary and space wasting. Overall, I can now go light and leave my heavy DSL and mirrorless in home while archiving the same photo results. As to its phone functions, I have tested this side-by-side with my kids LG phone bought this year. I can confirm that this phone transfer the images much faster on the same mobile data network. Also I am now able to make calls at the underground train station which I wasn't able to use my old 4G LTE phone. This device also supports upcoming CAT16/CAT 18 standards. Overall, this is a great device that allows photographers to shoot great photos, and switch to its desktop mode to conduct the photo editing instantly. I truly love this camera and hope it can last for a few years.",38,"HUAWEI"
"562","B07C6FCC8G",1,"true","Huawei had plans to make a splash with this phone when it was supposed to be offered by AT&T and sold at Best Buy but when those plans fell through due to obnoxious political bullying Huawei completely abandoned it in the United States. In other countries, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is receiving regular software updates but in the United States, Huawei is providing no updates. Mine is still on a security patch that's 5 months old. I was told by Huawei support that there is an update (from Google, not Huawei) but there is no way for me to get it until it shows up as an OTA which could take months or never happen at all. Feature updates like Turbo GPU reportedly aren't coming to owners in the US so the laggy scrolling I'm experiencing probably won't get fixed. Issues with the spotty Bluetooth are unlikely to ever be fixed either. Huawei stopped providing bootloader unlock codes for this phone in July so I can't flash a custom ROM. Alternate methods that Huawei owners sometimes employ to get updates like rebranding so the phone appears to be a model from a different region or using the Funky Huawei online tools are blocked but only on the US model. Despite having excellent hardware, stylish design and premium build quality this phone isn't worth $500 or even $200 without software updates.",34,"HUAWEI"
"563","B07C6FCC8G",4,"true","I finally had the will power to ditch the Samsung Galaxy line after 8 years and it was a great decision! I received this phone about 2 weeks ago and wanted to wait to review it after my trip to San Francisco. It did not disappoint at all, the camera is fantastic. It consistently outperformed my wife's iPhone 8 plus in every situation, low light, high contrast and zoom. What most impressed me was the battery life! I was on my phone from 7am to about 8pm and the phone still did not die from the heavy usage. The 4000mh battery is now gimmick. I was constantly taking pictures and videos of my kids, researching eating spots, snapchatting all day and posting to Facebook and Instagram. I was thuroughly impressed! There are only a couple concerns I can think of with this phone, not having wireless charging, now I don't use it nearly as much as my wife does but it was available with the previous model so I don't see why it wouldn't be available with the mate 10 pro. And for some reason I initially had a slow WiFi connection. After a system update and a reboot it seemed to go away but comes back every now and then and I have to turn off the WiFi and then turn it back on. But my T-mobile service was constantly outperforming the WiFi which should not be the case. I think with a patch and update this problem should be non existent in the future, internet still works well and this should not deter you from purchasing this phone for nearly half the price of a Galaxy s9 or s9+.",7,"HUAWEI"
"564","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","No complains so far. Used to be an apple user until I can't stand the horrible battery life and the unbelievable price tags. It's 2019, and they are still trying to sell extra for hard disk space??? That's greedy. Well, someone just has too much to spend I guess. For this phone, the battery life is solid 24-hour for me as a medium-level user with a full charge. When I don't use too much, it can definitely last more than 2 days. The phone is fast with games, apps. The Leica lens can really make some difference with great pictures. Low light photos are also pretty good. Finger print recognition is instant without any lag. Face recognition is something I don't care much, although it works as designed. Overall a great phone and a great buy.",1,"HUAWEI"
"565","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","Update: It appears that my Mate 10 Pro will not receive anymore updates including monthly security patches since Google has banned them from using Android immediately. I really feel sorry for those that recently spent their hard earned dollars on a new Huawei phone. Watch the prices for their phones plummet! I am a bit of a smart phone junkie. I have had all of the Note models except the 7 & 9. I also have an S8, S9, Zenfone 5Z and lots of midrange phones. When I saw the Mate 10 Pro drop to $550 I decided to give it a try and I am so happy I did. The screen is only 1080 and gets bright enough to read in direct sunlight. I have been spoiled by the best screens from Samsung, but this screen is perfectly fine and who really needs WQHD on a 6"" screen anyway. I'll take the drop in res and the extra battery life and while on that topic the battery life on this phone is amazing. Huawei's Kirin processor is fast and sips juice at the same time which is something Samsung had never been able to do. Granted the 4000 mAh battery helps, but the Note 9 with the same size battery will never match this phone in battery life. I have seen over 10 hours of screen on time which is almost double of any other phone I have had and this is with 4 email accounts and 3 different security camera systems running in the background. It's the only phone I have ever had that didn't need to be charged at some point during the day and I have yet to read about any other phone that has better battery life. It charges very quickly and will go from 0 to 60% in 30 minutes. Build quality is easily as good as the best from Samsung & Apple and it is a very comfortable phone to hold for extended periods. With 128 gigs of storage there is no need for an SD card ""at least for me"" and 6 gigs of RAM makes it fly and run smoothly. In daily use it is as fast as my S9 and it is more fluid. I don't use wired headphones so the lack of a 3.5mm jack is a moot point. The stereo speakers are very good and get loud enough for most any situation. I didn't think I would use the infrared port, but I ended up programming my TV and my girlfriends TV to it and use my phone for the remote anytime I watch TV. The cameras are very good even in low light, but they are not quite as good as my S9 & Note 8. If those two are 10's the M10P cameras get an 8. Cell reception seems to be a little better than my Samsungs, picking up signals in fringe areas where my other phones did not. Lastly, the finger print sensor is as good as they get and it makes all of the others feel inferior. This phone is a steal at its current price and my all time favorite.",4,"HUAWEI"

Sound is good pretty loud and design is beautiful. Fingerprint works very flawless and waterproof really works 5 months after buying it my wife put some clothes on the washing machine with phone inside and here I am leaving a review with the same phone. I really can say nothing bad about phone.",4,"HUAWEI"
"567","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","Where do I begin with how well rounded and as close to perfect you can get that this phone is? Everyone has their preferences – some people want a great camera, some a big easy to read screen, and others it may be long battery life. For me, I love to travel and the two most important features were battery life and the camera. With a 4,000 mAh battery and an in-house manufactured Kirin 970 processor, the battery life is insane. Of course, it’s a lot like cars and fuel mileage; how you drive them and how you use them affects results. For me, heavy WhatsApp, medium camera and video use, and YouTube. I always get a full day of use with around 35% left over, and I consider myself a heavy user. Don’t just take it from me though, read reviews on the Mate 10 Pro and you’ll constantly see it’s battery is among its highest-rated attributes. The reason I mentioned the processor is that by utilizing their in-house System-on-a-chip (SOC), Huawei can better program the phone and processor to best use available resources and achieve amazing battery life. Second, the camera. Wow! Again, check out how Huawei scored with their phones over at DxoMark, a prestigious camera ranking firm. They are not only #1 on the list but also have several phones in the top 10. I can’t always have my DSLR with me, so, I needed a phone which can achieve the best results from mobile photography I can find. And, if you’re into photography, you’ll know the Leica name. The dynamic range is superb, there are not any blown out highlights or over-sharpening, and details are clear. The camera app is stable with no crashes and shoots pictures at a very fast speed. I’ve been using the phone case that came in the box and I don’t feel the need for an aftermarket. It’s clear, so it doesn’t hide how gorgeous the phone is, and isn’t slippery either. Another huge benefit is the integrated EMUI desktop mode. You only need to purchase an HDMI to type-c adapter (around $15), and you get a great desktop experience. Most all apps run full screen, and I hook up a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and run Word to do my schoolwork. I’ve even played some games (with a Bluetooth controller), and it’s an awesome mobile gaming rig when you’re at a hotel! There are a couple of cons about the phone which are not extremely negative, but suggestions for Huawei. First, I work in an environment that is fairly loud most of the time. I can’t seem to find a ringtone that is loud enough for me always to hear it. I’m not sure if it a speaker issue, or that I’m going deaf. On that note, the vibration of the phone isn’t that strong. It’s definitely adequate, and I understand you don’t want something to vibrate so much that parts fly off, but, the unit could use some improvement in that area. The phone is “water-resistant” rated, so I understand why the concept of no expandable memory is there, but, there is a SIM tray so it shows it could be done. Also, I understand the idea behind the “cloud” so physical memory isn’t that important. However, when you’re away from signal on a hiking trip and recording gobs of 4k video, physical memory becomes important until you can upload it. 128GB is a great amount, but either offer 256GB and 512GB variants, or allow for expandable memory in the future. Speaking of the future, this saddens me. Huawei makes a stunning and gorgeous phone with amazing performance and features, and because of “concerns” by the United States government, they have lobbied U.S. cell phone companies to not sell their products. To me, without proof, this is unfounded. Heck, the NSA probably spies on me more than a foreign country does. I fell in love with Huawei devices after I started using them with the Mate 9. However, I had to get an international version of the Mate 9 at the time and even though it worked in the U.S., it did not have all the LTE bands. I noticed when using the Mate 9, my signal would not always be the greatest and speeds were acceptable. Upon buying the Mate 10 Pro (which Huawei included U.S. bands for the market), I get all the bands, great reception, and ridicules LTE speeds. Huawei recently released a phone called the P20 Pro with a 40 MP sensor and three camera system. Co-engineered with Leica, it achieves stunning results and is not a marketing gimmick. I would do anything to have this device here in the U.S! Yes, I can buy the “international version”; however, it does not function as well as the phones tuned specifically for U.S. markets. Now, all I can do is a dream and hope Huawei will continue to try and break into the U.S. market with their exceptional products. In closing, if you want a gorgeous phone that runs buttery smooth with no hiccups, takes breathtaking photos, has insane battery life, and is a great price – please please please consider buying this phone! I can not say how satisfied and happy I am I made this purchase! I just hope to have a U.S. version of the P20 Pro one day.",12,"HUAWEI"
"568","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","So I've had this phone for 2 months. I had the Mate SE before, which was great. My girlfriend's Samsung S7 wouldn't hold a charge so I gave it to her, she loves it too. So, I decided to buy myself the Mate 10 pro because of the camera and I was not disappointed. The call quality is perfect and the battery lasts longer than any phone I've had by far. The camera is amazing and has a bunch of cool modes, I won't go crazy into details but I can assure you it's awesome. Get away from Samsung and iPhones. These phones are superior and half the price. I did a ton of research and found the spying thing is just trash started by Samsung and apple to try to keep Huawei out of THE US market.

"569","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","Been a Samsung fan since before the first note. Loved them. Then they screwed up the note 8 or was it 6? Then skipped 7? Regardless they threw me a curve ball, or should I say a curved a screen. Out of all my years I never broke or cracked a single phone or screen. Edge 7 broke them both in a short period of time. I am a super geek and research the hell out of electronics, especially my phone. When I found Huawei (can never remember how to spell it) I was skeptical. Bought the gray a mate SE first lol and was blown away with quality. Bought this phone a few days later and I am in heaven. Everything is better than expected and not roped into my TMobile contract waiting for the phone to be paid off. Thank you Huawei for exceptional quality and craftsmanship. You are the new bad ass. Update: Been over a month now. I am so in love, it is crazy. Phone takes absolutely stunning photos. Zoom is crazy good. Battery still last like crazy, I literally use the heck out of my phone and at 2 am still has 60% battery. Calls, music, videos, games all day long. I use it to check my website and love the fact I never have to worry about a charger being close. Super fast and handles all the apps I throw at it. Way more options than Samsung ever thought about. The finger scanner is incredible. Have it set up for both hands so no matter what I can unlock phone quickly. OH camera opens as fast as you can snap your finger. Absolutely the best phone I have ever owned in my life and I have owned so many I could not list them all.",2,"HUAWEI"
"570","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","I love this phone. I was saddened to learn the Honor 10 phantom colors would not be available in the United States. I considered the aluminum body of the Honor view 10--it wasn't waterproofed and had a different asthetic. The mocha brown mate 10 pro is lovely and as close as I can get to the p20pro or honor 10 in the United States. The mocha is complex metallic bronze. This was an excellent prime day deal. EMUI is quirky and has a few bloatware items installed (booking.com anyone). But I realize I've become used to them after the Honor 8 and really felt lost when I used a LG q thin. This phone is lovely and I have no intention of returning it. It's light weight and comfortable in my glove size 8 hand. The photos are stunning and the leica cameras are worth the hype. Items that need improvement: The phone defeats most auto call features from apps such as banks as you have to confirm the call. This means I can't skip the line because it registers as a regular unautheticated phone call. I miss my dual SIM and/or sd card tray--not enough to return the phone but enough to mention it for future development. Huawei, consider wireless calling for tmobile. That's missing and when you need it you need it. I'm just happy to have some new styles and ideas hitting the us mobile phone market that can withstand inclement weather during commutes.",2,"HUAWEI"
"571","B07C6FCC8G",3,"true","Had the phone a little over 2 months now, after my Nexus 6P battery issues forced the need to purchase a new phone basically immediately. I wanted something unlocked, and didn't want an iphone or Galaxy, which leaves little options at the regular electronic stores, so I one day ordered through Amazon (which went great) something I thought would match my needs the best. Phone itself is great looking, great size and weight. The fingerprint scanner on the back is one of the most responsive I've ever used, and the optional gestures using that work well too. The general software it comes packaged with are eh. I prefer stock Android, so am running Nova Launcher to avoid EMUI as much as possible or to make it at least feel that way. There are a lot of weird ticks with this phone, and there aren't a lot of third party apps that you can use that integrate smoothly. The stock dialer is ugly and messy, but nothing else really works I've tried so I tend to mostly make calls via Google Contacts or by searching for a phone number in Chrome etc. The always on screen notifications are pretty spotty at best, and the notification led is not very customizable, and even if it was the brightness of it is so minimal I can barely see it in regular light. This means I tend to not see important texts or missed calls until much later most of the time, which is pretty obnoxious. I never realized I liked having the always on screen as much as I do, but since half the time it doesn't show the text or missed call icon, even just using the stock apps to send/receive them it really limits the usefulness of this feature. The stock camera software is pretty bad, and the regular color camera just takes ok pics. There are a lot of options that ""camera people"" will enjoy, but having come from the 6P and it's way ahead of everyone camera to this, has been disappointing. If I wanted to tweak settings like I was using a DSLR, I would literally just pull out my DSLR. The B&W camera however is insane, and takes amazing pics, but as I generally only grab pics with my phone for social media stuff or reminder lists, this is a little useless overall and just feels like a gimmick. I've tried a few third party camera apps, but again, the integration is spotty at best, and nothing really seems to make anything better than the not great stock app, so it's a wash. Updates from Huawei appear to be nearly non-existent for the US model, for what appears to be a myriad of reasons. This isn't the place to get into any of the political reasons or how I feel either way, but the lack of updates or hopes of one is pretty wack. EMUI 9/Pie have been rolling out to different international versions of this phone for almost 2 months now, and I'm not even on 8.1 yet. And in the 2ish months I've had the phone now, I've only received 2 security updates. For a flagship phone less than 2 years old in this day and age, that's pretty unacceptable. Especially coming from the 6P, which was getting updates up until December 2018, this has taken some getting used to. The battery is definitely the best part of this phone, with some notes. I've tweaked the hell out of every option I can to get the best settings for me, and how I need my phone to function. That means I override the AI as to what can use the phone when, and what apps have access to what options etc. It's dumb I had to spend hours doing this, but it was worth it. That said, I rarely find myself charging this more than once every 48 hours or so. And when I do, it's almost never to 100% (not because of any rules some blog might have written about for battery optimization, just I haven't needed to), and I still usually get 2 full days out of it. Goodbye are the days when I leave the house with the phone only at 30% and have that nagging feeling in the back of my head all morning that I need to find a place to charge it up. That alone makes up for many of my other complaints with this phone, because I've had some amazing phones over the years that could barely pull 8 hours on a full charge with how I used them, but this thing is a beast in that department so put that in the pros column for sure. Overall, I doubt I would recommend this phone for most people. People wanting an unlocked experience, with the option to customize your rom or any of the other perks that comes with it, forget about it. If you're literally just trying to have a phone you can swap providers with easily, there are better/cheaper options. EMUI is far too invasive and lacks basic options many of us are used to if you've ever used stock Android, iOS, or any flagship Samsung phone, and would be pretty frustrating to use for someone who isn't a phone nerd, but said phone nerd would be pretty turned off by the limits of this phone so why bother? And as there's basically no third party ROM support for this phone due to many issues, the viability of this phone once official support is cut off means this thing is already pretty obsolete. I definitely regret my purchase, and know I could return the item to Amazon even now because their policy is pretty robust in that regard, but I don't think I'd feel right doing that. So for now I'll ride this thing out, wishing the 6P was my forever phone and had a new huge battery with updates, and plan to replace my Mate 10 Pro by fall of 2020 when I am sure it will be a paperweight by then.",2,"HUAWEI"

"586","B07C6FCC8G",1,"false","Exciting news just announced from Huawei that will make buying the Mate 10 Pro even more enticing. The Mate 10 series will be the first to receive the GPU Turbo update at the end of June 2018. Huawei’s GPU Turbo increases the processing power of the GPU by up to 60% while reducing power consumption by 30%. The new feature was announced last week. And that is not all folks; Huawei also announced some new features coming to the Mate 10 series. First, the Mate 10's will support cloud computing starting June 26. It will then receive the EMUI 8.1 update in mid-July which will bring 960fps slow-motion recording. Exciting indeed! I, unfortunately, did not order mine which arrives today from Amazon because they were out of the Midnight Blue, but I will be posting my review once I have received the device and have had time to break it in. Update: 6/15/2018 - I received my Mate 10 Pro yesterday and absolutely fell in love with it, but it does have a major issue (reported below.) Firstly, the phone is beautiful, fast, and no Bluetooth issues like I had with my Huawei Honor 8, especially connecting to my car's Bluetooth (Nougat lacked many Bluetooth codecs.) I have only taken a few photos but was completely blown away. What I noticed most was the sound quality is MUCH better and the included headphones which look like the iPhone version, are better than Apple's. I was surprised. Battery life ....the best. The screen is bright and beautiful and the phone is large but doesn't feel large. It is just something you have to experience. It also looked thick in the youtube videos and add photos, but this is a very thin phone, feels great in the hand. Everything perfect, except for one glaring software issue.... MAJOR ISSUE: BACKGROUND RUNNING APPS ARE KILLED. I would advise not buying this phone if you need any background apps to run in the background. There is a long post about this glaring Huawei issue on XDA, many reporting it to Huawei's customer service who blame outside apps and refuse to address the issue. This is not true. It is an EMUI issue (see the XDA forum for details,) and it also happens on the Huawei Mate 9 and P20 with Oreo. There are settings in the ""Battery"" options that should allow you to keep certain apps running in the background, but they don't work. This also affects certain apps and widgets that need to refresh in the background. Most of Google's apps refresh and work, but many outside apps don't. Until Huawei steps up and recognizes they have a major issue, I can't recommend this phone fully at this time. Update: 07/14/2018 I wanted to add a few comments since I have had the phone for some time. I noticed a user replied that I should keep opening my app for at least a couple of weeks as a fix. I tried this, actually over two weeks, and it still kills my app in the background. A new issue I thought I would list is phone updates. I would really think strongly against buying any Huawei phone if updates, even small security releases from Google each month, are a concern. In the North American phones, Huawei refuses to update their phones. Mind you, the Mate 10 was their ""flagship phone."" There is a new report out of the NOYPIGEEKS dot com entitled, ""Huawei and Honor GPU Turbo software update schedule revealed."" Google it. You will notice they list the release schedule for this big update...and the US is not listed in the roll-out. I thought when purchasing this phone we Huawei said we were suppose to get regular security updates and at least 1 major OS update. I am assuming Huawei is ignoring the security updates and is going to wait and update the US phones whenever Android P is released. That is unacceptable. I will never buy another Huawei phone again. Update 8/10/2018: So, Huawei finally released a US update, but don't get too excited. It has been revealed in the news that the US will not be getting the Turbo update everyone wants. There is also no facial recognition in this update either. The update included Google security fixes and a camera update .....but the update breaks the camera's Night mode and some users report that can't take pictures at all. Way to go Huawei. They say on their chat that a fix is coming, but it is been about a month now and nothing. So, for those of you that see an update ending in .119, don't install it.",18,"HUAWEI"

"589","B07C6FCC8G",4,"false","The biggest reason to buy Huawei phone is due to its long battery life. I consider it silly that a cellphone would ever need to charge battery within a day. However, due to Mate 10 Pro's use of LED, it looks like it cannot run the screen continuously on for 8 hours, which loses one star in the review. But comparing to non-huawei phones, it is still 5 stars plus! Squeezing a big battery in the smartphone actually involves technology advance, for which I think iPhone is at least two years behind in technology, and I don't want to spend hard-earned money in overpriced iPhone either, trying to avoid iPhone's eco-system because everything related will be sucking money. Looks like the most useful google service is google's map, so if Huawei wants to continue to sell its phone without Google' service, Huawei needs to develop an app in similar quality to that of google's map (forget about Microsoft's stupid map). Huawei can do it with its resource, probably building it on top of freestreetmap.

Then, China started to illegally steal USA technology and sell it as if it was their own. However, now that China is trying to ""rise"" and compete with the USA, the USA under Trump has finally said ""Nope, not anymore; America first"". Accordingly, slowly but surely, China's economy will suffer dramatically in the coming years by the world's largest economy consumers (USA) realizing that Chinese made products are a real security concern for the USA, and not in the USA best interest.",8,"HUAWEI"

"644","B07C6FCC8G",4,"true","Edit as of February 20, 2019: My Mate 10 Pro, C567 (US version) just received the update to EMUI 9 (Android 9 Pie). With this update I received better AI, improved camera (better bokeh, better auto brightness/contrast settings), Super SlowMo (960 fps), Face Unlock and dozens of other tweaks and improvements. Bluetooth issues seem to be fixed as well. Only HiVision (AI objects recognition) and GPU Turbo seem to be missing, but these were not my top priorities list for this phone and I can pretty much live without them. And while now my Mate 10 PRO looks and feels almost as a new phone, EMUI 9 still requires polishing in terms of fluency. Overall, after almost a year of using the phone, I'm still pretty happy about it. Selfie camera could be better, and AI postprocessing could be less aggressive. I can definitely recommend it to those who are looking for a solid phone and don't want to invest a lot into buying current flagship phones. My only concern remains lack of communication from Huawei regarding updates. They actually delivered monthly updates over the year 2018, and now we have received the long promised Pie update. Still they could communicate about the update plan sooo much better than they actually did. ************************************ Oct.16, 2018 - UPDATE: the phone has recently received a handheld night camera mode with an August security patch, and the update with September security patch has just started rolling out. However, still no sign of Face Unlock or GPU Turbo. Probably, we're entirely skipping Android 8.1 and heading directly towards Android 9.0. Besides, I've found a pretty frustrating issue: bluetooth audio quality is rather bad - tried it with multiple bluetooth speakers on two phones. The audio codecs in Android 8 are most likely crippled, and looks like lots of Huawei phones have this issue. We'll see if Android 9.0 can fix this issue. ************************************ Original review below: Before buying Huawei Mate 10 Pro, I read lots of reviews and discussions on forums - it took a while to make a decision and I don't regret it. The phone feels very good in a hand. When you take it, you immediately know it's a business-class phone. Screen, battery life and performance are no doubt top class. Camera is really good, but takes some time to master - some scenes get too much overprocessing with AI. It's not a point and shoot camera, but you can get amazing results with it, especially if you learn the Pro Shooting Mode. I'd totally recommend buying a full screen antiexplosion glass and a good protective case for it, since dropping the phone may result in large damage to screen/back and a very costly repair. The only thing that troubles me a lot (and lots of users on xda, reddit etc.) is lack of insights regarding the software updates. Right now, in July, the US version of the phone is still running April security patch (8.0.0.112) and doesn't have the much awaited FaceUnlock or handheld night camera mode yet - while both features have long been launched across Asia and Europe. No comments or announcements have been done in this regard by Huawei. What's even worse, is that Huawei keeps a full radio silence regarding the further updates - I'm referring exclusively to the US version of the phone now. Recently. they announced transition to a bi-monthly update plan and an upcoming Android 8.1 update featuring GPU Turbo Mode, coming everywhere - but for USA (according to the official sources). It seems like the US version has been abandoned in terms of software updates. Thus I put 4 out of 5 to this phone, unless there is some clear response from HuaweiDeviceUSAService in regards to the software update plans. Will the US version of Mate 10 Pro get the FaceUnlock, handheld night camera mode? Will there be updates to Android 8.1 and to Android P? That we are yet to see in the future.",151,"HUAWEI"
"645","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","I just received the Mate 10 Pro today, and I am blown away by its performance. I've put it through hell and the battery has exceeded my expectations. This phone easily has the best battery performance I have ever seen in a cell phone. The camera is great, the screen is bright and has great resolution. The fingerprint sensor is fast, and precise. I love how quickly it responds to touch. The processor is fast, and everything has been running smoothly. I'm using the phone on T-mobile - - no problems at all. Don't believe the negative propaganda. I have used Samsung and Apple phones in the past, and can honestly say that the Mate 10 Pro is a high quality phone equal to (and maybe even surpassing) some of the better known brands. This phone is worth a try!",198,"HUAWEI"
"646","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","I have a lot of Android phones and this one is simply awesome. Coming from a Pixel 2XL on AT&T I took out my sim and put it in the Mate 10 Pro and I find I have VoLTE (like a certified AT&T phone) with excellent signal and voice quality better than any AT&T certified phone I have. The phone has excellent battery life (way better than my Pixel or my Note 8) and is as fast as either of the top flagships. The weight is excellent and it has good feel in the hand, and the vibration motor is also really good for haptic feedback. Display is a really good OLED panel that looks very Samsung tuned (which means viewing angles and color saturation is near perfect). Sound is also real loud and speakers are stereo so it's fun to use. Finally the camera is the best in the Android business with lots of features and excellent color and exposure. Comparatively to the Pixel 2 XL I see some shots on my Mate 10 Pro are better, especially low light, and the selfies are good when you turn off beauty mode. It's has a great portrait mode as well. I would recommend this phone to any iPhone or Android user and could promise a good experience once you tweak it the way you like it. I use Nova Launcher and Textra for SMS and this thing is perfectly customizable all the way through the software system so you can eliminate some of the EMUI aspects of the OS.",130,"HUAWEI"
"647","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","This is my first look at this cool phone. I was in the Market for the Mate 9 about a year ago when I found out that this one will be out soon. The wait is over and I'm not disappointed. Data transfer from my old Samsung Galaxy S6 took a mere 12 minutes, and I had a good 20 GB of Data to transfer. Simply download and install ""Phone clone"" from the App store, load it on both Phones, and you are good to go. (follow the instructions) The performance is stunning, very smooth running, I had all my custom sounds and apps running in no Time. The Camera is simply amazing. It does come with a clear Case, which I did not care for too much, so I purchased one from Tudia, it is much more robust and protective. After 30 or so minutes, I had all my important apps working, set up multiple Email accounts, etc. A little gripe, but not too big of a deal is that it requires the USB C style Cables. Also, it doesn't support wireless charging. A bigger Deal is that it doesn't come with Alexa. The Mate 9 did. Oh, well I'll live. Everyone is raving about the Battery life on this thing, and I have several power hungry apps running at the same time, so we will see about that and I'll report it here. I haven't used the translator yet, but it looks fantastic. The Camera is truly a marvel, shoots pictures on a very high resolution, the Camera actually recognizes what you shoot and therefore picks the right (or sometimes wrong) settings for you. The Fingerprint sensor is ultra fast, I use it to unlock the phone. I know I have only begun to work with this phone, there are many more very cool options to use and I'll report it here as soon as I uncovered some useful tricks. So far I'm impressed, to say the least. 1. Update: Verizon Customers, listen up! (read carefully) QUIT asking if this Phone will work with VERIZON. It will not. EVER! At least read through some older questions before you post yours. Thank you. The End.",133,"HUAWEI"

"649","B07C6FCC8G",4,"true","Like one of the other reviewer on this site, ""Ancher"", I initially could not get the phone to work. I received my unit yesterday (Feb 20th), and went to AT&T store immediately, they were able to set it up quickly and copy over contact and other info from my old phone. Then I noticed that it has no LTE or 4G signal. The employee at AT&T store was not able to figure out why there is no mobile data network. The phone can receive and make calls, and SMS message also works, but just no internet. After about 1 hour, they gave up, and told me to contact Huawei. That was around 4PM. I went home and contact Huawei right away, the CS agent (her name is Marisa) spend close to 2 hours with me, trying out various stuff, including couple of factory reset, which wipes out stuff I moved over from old phone, still no connection. Wifi works, but just no internet. The option to enable 4G under mobile network menu couldn't be set to enable. They checked the IEMI number, everything seems to check out. In the end, she said to wait 24 hours, maybe it takes a little while for the new SIM card to register. Then I found the review on this site by ""Ancher"". I actually print out his review and took it with me when I visited AT&T store again. They were not sure what to take of that, but to their credit, they were willing to try the method mentioned by ""Ancher"". One of their employee swap my SIM card with his iPhone8's. Both were able to connect to LTE quickly, we played around with some website for a short while, then switched the SIM cards back, and just like I have hoped, my Mate 10 Pro suddenly had no problem with connecting to 4G LTE network. The phone is beautiful, and camera is amazing, but I wish I didn't have to go through this to get it to work. In the end, neither AT&T, nor Huawei was able to fix the problem. It was the power of internet and user community that came through.",72,"HUAWEI"
"650","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","This is a great phone. All those mumbo jumbo about spying....I'm pretty sure nsa or some other big bro are reading everything anyway. Now about the phone itself. I rarely experience any lag. I am kind of person that don't really care how a phone look, as long as it has most of the function i needed or wanted, but this phone is so beautiful i actually got a clear case for it. The pictures are amazing i actually can brag about how pretty my pictures are to my friend and family that are using iPhone or Samsung. I can set different apertures, take super fast portrait mode.... One surprising feature, the monochrome lens. Wow I never thought I would like anything in black and white. I hated those black and white movies, but The pictures monochrome lens took was wow, I loved it. I felt like I am one of the super famous photographers that have gallery to show off my work. The AI can recognize different things that are on in front of the camera. Once I took a picture of my street it showed that it's scenery then when I took a picture of the same place during snow. It actually has a small snow flake on the bottom of the screen. When I take a picture of my dog it showed a little doggy on the bittom. The AI can determine what are The best setting, lighting, and other parameters to get The best reault. The battery life is unbelievably long after a while day of work i still have around 70% battery left. Funniest part is started the day with around 94%. It takes about 2hours to fully charge from 30%. Since I had the phone it never went below 30%. I don't game allot, but all The game i have it ran quick and smooth. The resolution of the screen is more than enough for phone this size. All the phones with 4k resolution etc...are way over kill all it does is drain your battery.even at 2k that this phone has is still over kill. Overall The screen is pretty and vibramt. You can also set the screen time to give etc... The emui is not the greatest os skin but with any new toy it can take a bit of learning curve. There are some thing I missed from my nexus6. I love the large favorite tiles from the Google phone app.but mostly just minor things, over time I will get adopt to it and who knows might even like the way huawei has it. Now the bad... IT DOESN'T HAS ANY HEADPHONE JACK..... I usually have 2sets of headphone when I am at work, a Bluetooth and a 3.5mm. It's so annoying when my Bluetooth headphone ran out of battery now because my good headphone is not compatible. I have to use the crappy ones that came with it. If you don't like the themes, you can always dl nova launcher and other launcher to cover it. S8s9+ they are just too dang tall. I tried it just felt kinda awkward. They are basically the same damn phone, s9 has a better camera. Samsung need the step up.

"652","B07C6FCC8G",3,"true","There is no denying that the Mate 10 Pro is a beautifully crafted powerhouse worthy of taking on any competitor flagship device. The build is decidedly premium and the device is chocked full of features. EMUI is definitely an acquired taste but, after using it for some time, I found myself liking it - that being said, it's about as far away from stock android as you can get. The deal breaker for me - and the reason I actually got rid of this device - was the complete and utter lack of any updates for the US variant of this device. The US variant was excluded from the turbo GPU rollout and, at the time I got rid of my device in late August, it was STILL running on the April (yes, that's April) security patch. Unfortunately Huawei has essentially abandoned its US customer base and, given the circumstances, I can't entirely blame them. It's a real shame too because this is truly a spectacular device, but the lack of post-purchase support and updates is really inexcusable for any flagship device. That being said, if software updates and timely security patches are not essential for you, this device is worth considering. Unfortunately, for me, all the great aspects of this device were not enough for me to look past using a flagship device running with nearly 6 month old security patch.",13,"HUAWEI"

"671","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","I bought the phone after my Google Pixel XL took a dunk in the sea water and lost its life. I did some extensive research before I settled for the best Huawei phone at the time. I am really picky about camera, Pixel 2 XL was my first choice but didn't buy one because of high price tag and so so battery life. The Huawei phone has great size in hand: not as wide as Pixel XL, easier to handle with one hand. The screen size is reasonably good. Although it doesn't have the pixel density as Pixel XL, I was not able to tell the difference during day to day use. Camera: not as good as the Pixel XL in terms of color vibrancy (Huawei Mate 10 pro photos tend to have more contrast than my liking during high contrast situation), but low light photo is probably a little better due to image stabilization. It's max zoom photo is sharper than Pixel. But those are the extreme situation we are talking about. In those situation, Huawei has a Black and White camera that does a decent job capturing the image. Software: Unlike some polarizing review about Huawei's operating system, I find Huawei's effort is mostly unobtrusive. The Safe App is a nice touch, but you do loose the full size backup of photos and first in line update Google offered to Pixel phones. Battery life: OMG, this is where this phone shines. When I am using the Pixel (small one) my battery was at 15% around 6pm; when I was using the Pixel XL, my battery was at 15% around 9pm; while using the Mate 10 Pro, my battery was at 50% around 11pm. The phone saved my day a few times when I was traveling in China, snatching 600 photos at History Museum of Shaanxi and Terra Cotta Museum. Irregularities: Back in my days with Samsung and Google phones, I would encounter about one unexpected shut-down and re-start. My limited experience with Huawei has no such issue (only four months though). Overall experience: I use the phone to take pictures, check email, listen to music and watch videos. I do a lot of internet surfing and play very little video games (my son do use it to play games). For what I do with the phone, it runs flawlessly.

"683","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","have had IPhones since the Iphone 4. this thing blows iphones away!!! great picture! great camera! and great sound! its super fast and works on T Mobile a lot better than any of my old iphones ever did! it feels good in my hand or in my pocket, its not too big nor is it too small, its just damn right! Huawei has a new customer for life!! thank you so much for bringing it to the US!! the only negative thing i can think of at this moment is so far im having a hard time finding a good case that i like the look of for it. i ordered one and when it came in it was just cheap feeling and didn't fit right. i had my eye on 3 others that were a bit more expensive but they are all out of stock now.. just my luck. i used Lunatik for my iphones but i don't think they are even in business any more.. may have to check them out and see if they still are and make a case for the Mate 10 Pro. quick edit... forgot to mention the battery life. now granted i don't use my phone as a computer like most people do..i don't sit around and surf the internet with it, i don't have a tun of games i play all day long... that being said compared to my iphone the Mate 10 Pro's battery life is much better. doing the same things i normally do in a day i used way less battery than i would on my iphone. by the time i got home from work today i think i was sitting at 95% charge if not more. on my iphone it would be at 50% or less... usually less. thank you again Huawei for bringing the Mate 10 Pro to the US!!! Update nearly a year later.... Still going strong and battery life is amazing, i can usually go 2 days without charging. Customer support is also amazing, most helpful and quick to respond and very helpful they even CALLED me a few days later to check to make sure everything was working correctly and if i have had any more problems. so the people saying customer service is horrible must have used the wrong thing or are not telling the truth because i have never had such great customer service before. the problem i had was i had turned something off in the settings or disabled something and it wasn't able to download its updates. so the problem i had with it was a user error problem he he. Also wanted to note that my work phone also got upgraded to a samsung note 9... the Mate 10 Pro still blows that thing out of the water. picture quality is better on the Mate 10, sound quality also better on Mate 10, now i have better coverage on my Mate 10 on T Mobile than i do with the note 9 on verison but that might just be because T Mobile is better than verison.. i don't really know about that part. Battery life is WAY better on the Mate 10 as well... the note is sitting at 48% at the end of the day when i get home from work and i have not used it at all for anything not even looking at email or sending a text just sitting there doing nothing and its at 48% not sure if its because of bloat ware or what but my Mate 10 is sitting at 90% and i actually use it to check personal email and to send texts. All in all i really love this phone. it has held up great this past year and i would recommend this phone to anyone wanting to upgrade and or just wanting a new nice phone. i have been telling my friend he needs to get one of these but he decided to go with a different one forget what it was but now he is regretting it after 6 months and he actually asked me what it was that i had and i think he is going to finally take my advice and get a Mate 10 Pro. Once again thank you Huawei for bringing the Mate 10 Pro to America!",219,"HUAWEI"
"684","B07C6FCC8G",1,"true","I was excited to get the Huawei Mate 10 because I loved the 9 so much. However, I quickly realized they modified things on the 10 in order to make it more proprietary. Otherwise, there isn't much difference. The phone is quick but there is no longer an aux port for headphones. Headphones must use the USB-C port and be compatible. I started having trouble with the camera quality as well. The rear-facing camera takes very beautiful quality pictures. However, the front-facing camera was warped and make pictures look distorted. Almost like you're looking through a fishbowl. There were minimally different features such as the ""Translate"" app and the ""full-screen mode"" for apps. I switched back to the Huawei Mate 9 because i found the 10 to be of lower quality overall. If you have a 9, I recommend staying with it or upgrading to a Samsung Galaxy S9.",9,"HUAWEI"

Customizing my phone and app settings is so much easier and intuitive, so the phone feels more like an extension of me rather than a display phone with a few of my stickers on it. 3. Set up was super smooth, quick and simple. Once the new SIM card was in, it was ready to use. Battery was only at 50%, but it charges really fast. 4. A set of headphones (decent sound quality) ending with a male usb c (instead of 3.5mm jack) is included, but they also included an adapter for your favorite 3.5mm headphones. I found that very thoughtful. 5. No bloatware! Even un-carrier phones would have a ton of pre-installed software in addition to the Android stuff, but this one has *very* few additions and they're easy to uninstall or disable. The only reason I give this 4.5/5 is that there's no option to expand capacity with a micro (or nano) SD card. I know that's a feature available in the mate 20 pro, but I wish this phone had it.

"701","B07C6FCC8G",3,"true","Good looking phone. Offers some nice features such as a (limited) desktop mode that would have served me well. EMUI 8.0 feels a bit closer to Google's version of Android and the few pre-installed apps can be easily uninstalled. However, there are some downsides which lead me to return mine: The device doesn't support VoWiFi on the T-Mobile network! If you need that feature because of low signal at home or in your office, look elsewhere! Regarding to a post on XDA, this feature is exclusively to the AT&T network. Auto focus on the camera seems to work only if it feels like it. I took a number of sample shots and most of them looked sort of blurry. The implementation of the ""always on"" display is mediocre at best! You will receive notification on the lock screen only for some (Huawei) apps. For anything else, you have to unlock the device and check the notification manually. Also, there is no ""tab to wake"" feature. Having to push the power button or lift up the device to unlock it with the finger print reader is rather annoying. And you will do that quite often when the device lays before you on the desk; somehow you have to check your notification. Not cool, Huawei! SmartLock is rather useless. There is no option to keep the device unlocked based on your location, with trusted voice or your face. The only option available is via Bluetooth devices around you. Huawei has their own ""voice unlock"" on board but that is essentially for making phone calls or answering a call. Maybe I am nitpicking here but all this gives the device an ""unfinished"" feeling. Most if not all of it could be fixed via software updates but, unfortunately, for that price, I am just not willing to gamble. I'll miss the good looks and the desktop mode but, as it stands, the device is not for me.",7,"HUAWEI"

"705","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","So I've upgraded to a Mate 10 Pro from a Mate 9 which was an upgrade from a Panasonic DMC-CM1. My holy grail: a really good phone, combined with a really good camera, with a large-ish screen that fits my large-ish hands. I have both the Mate 10 Pro and the Mate 9 in hand right now, with the intent to keep the one that I prefer. I am likely going to be keeping the Mate 10 Pro. Where It's Better than Mate 9 - Viewing angles on screen - Light evenness on screen - Performance (slightly) - Maximum camera aperture (f/1.6 vs. f/2.2—the primary reason I'm upgrading) - Built-in memory capacity (128GB vs 64GB) Where Mate 9 is Better (IMO) - Screen size (both are 6"" diagonal, but the 9 is 16:9 HD, while the Mate 10 is 18:9 and has less area) - Dual SIM capable and SD capable (Mate 10 Pro is one SIM, no SD) - Build quality (not a fan of all-glass) - Speakers (Mate 9 has more of them and they sound better) - Screen color (richer than Mate 10 Pro, which is odd, because 9 is IPS while Mate 10 Pro is AMOLED) At the end of the day, both the Mate 10 Pro and the Mate 9 are VERY good to excellent Android phones, easily a match for any manufacturer's flagships right now. Blindingly fast and smooth, great screens, industry-leading battery life and battery optimization, industry-leading fingerprint scanner, great compatibility, just a joy to use all around. The Camera Question If you're like me, however, the main reason you were drawn to these phones is for the camera. On this front, neither is as good as the Panasonic DMC-CM1 (nothing else on the market is, either). I still miss it daily, but the phone half of that phone was getting to be too old to be usable as a phone. The Mate 9 at max f/2.2 aperture is pretty good, but noise reduction artifacts become an issue indoors and in dimmer light. Enough of an issue to bug me and cause me to invest in the Mate 10 Pro as an experiment for comparison. Also, the tiny sensor and f/2.2 aperture just meant absolutely no DOF control whatsoever. Yes, there is software simulation of shallow DOF, but it only really works for portraits—when there is something in the foreground and something in the background. If you want to see this software simulation fall down quickly, just get something long (a bridge, railroad tracks, a subject lying down) and photograph them using software DOF mode. The part nearest the lens will be in focus. The part farthest away from the lens will be blurred. And in the middle, rather than a gradual transition (as you would get from a real wide aperture lens on a large sensor), you see a sudden transition from sharp to blurry where the software decided the transition from ""foreground"" to ""background"" happens. In short, it's not real DOF control and in most non-portrait shooting situations, it just can't be made to look like real DOF control. That said, I do very much like the rest of the image quality coming out of the Mate 9/10 series, particularly in RAW mode. So the goal became to get the largest aperture possible for this tiny sensor. That is f/1.6 on the Mate 10 Pro. Is it worth the upgrade? For me it is. What would my ideal be? Probably the Mate 10 Pro camera in the Mate 9 body. Or even better, the same camera module but with an f/1.0 lens (I don't mind if it protrudes a bit like some other phones) in the Mate 9 body. But you go with what's available—and that's the Mate 10 Pro, for now. Five stars because in comparison to all the other phones on the market, it's amongst the top 2-3, if not the very top.",1,"HUAWEI"

"732","B07C6FCC8G",3,"true","There is really a lot to like about this phone but a few issues might be a deal breaker for me. I always use high end phones and was currently using the Pixel 2 XL before this phone. From an aesthetics standpoint, this phone blows the Pixel away but my problem is EMUI. Here are the things I love; 1) In my opinion, this is the nicest looking phone on the market and it feels great in the hand. A major plus for this. 2) Call quality is excellent. I think it gets better reception and sound great on both ends. 3) Battery & Fast charging. I won't dive too deep into this but this phone is a beast on battery life. I typically have at least 40% remaining by the time I go to bed where in the past, I would have had to put a phone on the charger. Kudos for this. 4) The speakers sound really good. Not quite as loud as the Pixel, but that is because the lower speaker is on the bottom. Still, it sounds really good. 5) Pretty easy setup with the Huawei smart switch but Android is petty easy anyway. Still, took about a half hour to transfer everything. 6) Fingerprint scanner is the fastest and most accurate I have ever seen. This is important to me since EMUI does not support Smart Lock. More on that in the negatives. Now the negatives; 1) I'm not a huge fan of EMUI. It is a lot better than it used to be, but I feel like I need a manual to figure it all out. Tons of hidden menus / sub menus 2) Scrolling video works poorly. I am not referring to watching a video or live stream, I am referring to events. I use Nest cameras and could normally scroll through events. On this phone, it just turns black and blurry. I've tried this on two different phones and they are exactly the same. On the Pixel 2, as well as my wife's Iphone, it scrolls perfectly. It has nothing to do with the wifi or signal either as both are great. Just keep this in mind if you are using a Nest camera system. 3) My call blocker is useless with EMUI. I have tried every setting suggested by TrueCaller, and nothing works. All calls come right through. This could be a deal breaker for me as I am overwhelmed with solicitations and spam calls. There is an internal blocker but I need specific types of calls blocked. 4) Alerts are hit or miss. Sometime you get them, and sometimes you don't as evidenced by my Ring Pro doorbell. This is both in the office, and home. I have done a hard reset, cleared the cache, and also tried reinstalling the app. This is not a deal breaker but I don't understand why it does not work all of the time. 5) EMUI does not use the android smart lock feature. In my opinion, this is one of the best features of android. Basically the system is programmed to know and trust you so it will not lock in the designated areas. This feature does not exist in EMUI except a bluetooth function that sort of does a similar function, but only works half of the time. If you are like me, and constantly picking up your phone, and putting it down, it is an extra step to have to always unlock it. I have no idea why Huawei would not use the android smart lock function. Ok, so I am not saying this is not a great phone. It is but it lacks the specific functions I use and need on a daily basis. I am trying to love it, and still not sure if I will keep it or not but if I am unable to get a bit more consistency from it, I think it's going back. I will give it a couple of weeks to see if the AI chip learns or changes anything. Just my opinion for what it's worth. Edit 3/4/18 I really tried to like this phone, and unfortunately, I really do like it. However, after several attempts with Huawei to get the blockers working, and the issues with my notifications, the phone is going back. I tried everything from factory resets, to any and all possibilities. More than I have ever done to try to get this phone to work as needed. I could honestly say that this could be my favorite phone I have ever used but the lack of necessary features just kill it for me. Back it goes.",28,"HUAWEI"

"746","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","I already owned a Huawei tablet so I knew how good their quality was. When my less than a year old G8 phone overheated over night and the screen looked like it took LSD, I decided to get this phone. The only negative is it has no wireless charging which is ridiculous for a pro phone. However it has double the internal storage of the G8 and 2 more gb of memory. I was surprised that it came with a basic gel case and a screen protector already on it. Nice but I will still get a different case. Aa little surprised it has no microSD slot but again it has 128gb of storage so not really needed especially in the world of cloud storage. *Update* While this phone is still the best I have ever had, I have come to discover it is not compatible with my Fitbit Vera as far as syncing the clock/apps/faces via wifi. This is not to say that it won't discover and pair via bluetooth. But to setup a fitbit from start you need wifi.

"752","B07C6FCC8G",5,"false","My initial impressions are that this is the best smart phone I have ever used. I am coming from a Galaxy S7 and this is a definite step up. I had read that the Bluetooth on these can have some connectivity issues, but I have seen zero evidence of this. My Bluetooth automatically connects to saved devices such as my car stereo. The songs and artists display as they should. The battery life is unbelievable. The battery is gigantic, and the 5amp Supercharging is insane. I think in addition to having a gigantic battery that the phone itself has some smart battery utilization. This may be from the AI chip divvying out the energy. I work in a place where there is spotty service and my old Galaxy would need to be charged halfway through the day searching for signal. Now I go home with 65% battery life remaining which is insane to me. The thing is stupid fast with 6 gigs of RAM. Almost nothing else on the market has this much virtual memory. Awesome speed for sure. Android 8.0 lacks a few features that I like, but it's customizable so it isn't a huge issue. The native text app, I think Google messaging, no longer supports silencing notifications for conversations. If you have that pesky group message that blows up your phone will will go off non-stop. This means you have to download a third party messaging app in order to silence particular conversations. Textra has worked seamlessly for me. One bummer is that (on the AT&T network) VoLTE is not supported. For me this means no WI-FI calls or texts. SMS is only supported when you have service. With AT&T branded devices you can send texts and make calls over Wi-Fi, but that feature is not supported on this unlocked phone. All in all its great.

"758","B07C6FCC8G",1,"true","I completely regret switching from a $299 Moto X4 to the ""flagship"" Mate 10 Pro, this was my first and last Huawei device. Here's some of the quirks I've dealt with: Camera - Each time you open the camera app, you will be spammed with the message: ""Wide aperture adds bokeh effects to your photos to emphasize the subject."" The message takes up a quarter of the screen and you need to either tap the screen or take a dummy picture before taking your real picture for the message to go away (until you open the camera app again.) - One day you'll be spammed with the message ""sharpening photo, do not move your phone"" (after every single picture), next day the messages go away completely. Miscellaneous - You will not get 3rd party notifications on the always on display, my last 3 phones (even budget ones) supported this feature - I decided to turn off always on display since lock screen notifications worked, that is until they didn't. Gmail notifications stopped appearing on my lock screen even though everything was enabled, then 3 days later it started working again. - The battery management is so aggressive on this phone that I think it affected my SMS notifications. One day a friend sent me an important SMS message which I never received a notification for, he eventually messaged me over google hangouts which I received. I then opened up SMS and then suddenly the notification finally popped up. I went to Settings -> Battery -> Launch and realized SMS was set to ""manage automatically"" (default for all apps) while hangouts was set to ""manage manually"" which is why I think alerts work fine hangouts but sometimes not for SMS. - Huawei doesn't support the popular quick charge standard, so 3rd party QC wall chargers or QC power banks will not fast charge this phone, you'll need to buy official huawei fast charger. I ended up factory resetting the phone but the issues resurfaced shortly thereafter. Figured I got a lemon so Amazon sent me a replacement, same exact issues on the 2nd one. These issues may have been resolved in a software update but Huawei is not supporting the US model with updates. For perspective, my phone is on April security update and very old firmware .112 (international versions are on .150), so we're missing out on features like face unlock and possible fixes to my complaints above. I will be returning this phone to Amazon.",10,"HUAWEI"

"761","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","This is, honestly, the best phone I've ever used. I bought it for the camera as I like to take pictures everywhere I go and it's not always practical to lug a DSLR around. What interested me initially was the Leica dual lens camera with F/1.6 aperture and 20/12 megapixel resolution. It has all kinds of ""smart"" modes but what I found most useful was the pro mode that allows for exposure, film speed and other adjustments as well as offering an actual manual focus in addition to the auto. The camera is amazing and probably overkill for most people, I still find l little things I can do with it every time I snap a new photo. On paper, the Mate10pro has everything I could ever ask for in a phone and more than some high end tablets and computers (Including the one I owned at the time). 6gb RAM and 128gb memory with a 2160x1080 display are pretty impressive and I find myself using the phone more and more in applications usually better left to a computer such as drawing and photo editing. I go to the mate10 when editing my business page in Facebook far more often than my computer. That being said, I still hesitated about purchasing it due to the pervasive anti-Chinese tech sentiment and their generalized reputation for poor quality- if the charging port in my Samsung S5 hadn't finally stopped working I might still be debating the purchase right now. I pulled the trigger finally and I can say without reservation that I haven't made a better aquistion in my life. Fit and finish are as good as I've ever seen, and the battery life is phenomenal. Using the supplied charger I can get full charge in an a couple hours and it easily lasts through a normal 12 hour shift at work. Even running multiple apps (Facebook, Adobe Sketch) I can count on 4-6 hours before I have to look for an outlet. I bought it this spring and it's proven itself well worth the purchase price ($612 and change for the phone, Spurion case, next day shipping and tax). I've bought a few value minded tech purchases from Chinese companies before and have come to expect a certain trade-off between expectation and price point but I'm left wanting nothing in this particular instance. I'm not a hardcore techie and I doubt that I've really pushed this little machine to it's limits but I'm very impressed and extremely happy with the product I received from Amazon.

In reading Some of the other reviews I noticed people missing alerts From Certain things, I noticed this as well but I figured it out.

The phone has been extremely fast running games, movies, general apps etc. No crashes, slow down, etc. Have had zero issues with call quality- has sounded clear on both ends of the call. For the size, the phone feels pretty light as well. Coming from a smaller Xperia Z3 I was a little worried how the slightly larger phone would feel- no regrets! The screen is beautiful as well. Some reviews on other sites noted it has a slightly lower resolution than some alternate options- frankly unless you are running image tests, you wont notice in day to day use. It's a beautiful screen. Sound quality is a step up from my old Xperia as well. Overall, very thrilled with this offering from Huawei. I also have the Huawei Classic Watch 2 paired with this- perfect combo and is working great. Do your research about the tech on this phone, it's top notch. The US is getting this one a little later than the international community but it's good to know it has been a hit in many countries outside of the US. Really solid option for US consumers if you are looking for an alternate to the big 2 here. A note on car chargers and extra wall chargers- if you want to keep the extremely fast charging this phone is capable of, be sure to look for 5A charging capable cables and devices. Many of the other devices use 2A or 3A charging which doesn't provide the power this device needs for its quick charge abilities.

Instagram has crashed several times, a text I sent to a group went to one individual only (she showed me on her phone that it only went to her even though my phone made it look like it went to the group) and all my text messages with my boyfriend, which had been imported from the Nexus 6P, were just gone one day. I also don't love all the Huawei apps that are installed as alternatives to Google apps, and had to figure out how to disable them all to avoid getting two sets out notifications all the time. The headphones are like airplane ones, hard plastic that won't stay put in your ears, and which are super uncomfortable. They were 'free' with the phone though, so I'm not complaining about that too much. The free case and headphone jack converter were nice.

"790","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","It's sad that this phone won't get the exposure it deserves, because it really is a great phone. For starters, the battery life is incredible. With heavy use (games like Hearthstone and lots of YouTube) I can easily come out the other side of my 12 hour shift with 15-20% left. If you do have to charge it though, the supplied charger puts out 4.5A @ 5V and will get you several more hours of use in no time flat. The fingerprint sensor is something else that is unbelievably fast. Almost the instant you touch the well placed sensor the phone is unlocked. I loved how fast the sensor is on my Nexus 6P which is also a Huawei built phone, but this one is in a whole other ballpark as far as speed is concerned. Another thing I like about it is the stereo speakers. I loved the ones in my 6P and was hugely disappointed in the sad, lone speaker Google put on my Pixel XL. This phone uses the single bottom firing speaker while in portrait mode but uses both when in landscape and is more than adequate for showing your co-workers the latest video you found of Panda bears falling over and over again. The camera is another area that Huawei made sure was done right. Pictures turn out great with no effort and only get better with all the options they give you. Same goes for videos, there are a total of 9 different modes of video that go from tiny MMS size videos to 4k @ 30 fps, along with 1080p @ 60 & 120 fps, and 720p @ 240 fps. Now that I've brought up the Pixel XL that I attempted to replace my 6P with I want to say something about how these phones feel in your hand. The 6P and the Mate 10 Pro both feel as expensive as they are. The Pixel XL feels like the cheap plastic toys you get with the tickets at Chuck E Cheese. It's a minor point to most I'm sure but if I'm spending $800+ on a phone I want to feel like my money is well spent. As for the things I don't like. My main gripe is the display. Yes, under most circumstances it's a great screen even though the resolution isn't as high as other flagship phones. There are really only a few instances where its lower resolution shows itself, and the main one where I notice it is in the game Hearthstone. When your cards are low in your hand the card art is pretty distorted looking. When you bring them up to take a closer look they are much better looking. On the 6P and Pixel XL the card art is nice and sharp all the time. The other complaint I have is of course the lack of a headphone jack. We've all got our own opinions and I'm on the side that misses it. If Samsung can make an IP68 rated phone with a headphone jack then Huawei should be able to as well. But of course them and Google are too busy worrying about what Apple is doing. We don't need thinner phones that make it easier to bend/break these expensive phones, and I'd much rather have the jack than the IR blaster they included.",29,"HUAWEI"

"795","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","I've had my Mate 10 Pro Over a year now It's proven to be much better than I had hoped. The phone has a large screen, is fast, looks good, doesn't mysteriously reboot randomly (like the one I won't name), no compatibility issues (which surprised me considering it's running EMUI) and has 128gb onboard storage (which is plenty for me). The fingerprint sensor on the back works extremely well and allows you the ability to unlock the phone via this avenue (so no more needing to press the power button to turn on the screen before scanning your fingerprint). The phone comes with a case and screen protector, so it's instantly usable as a normal device out of the box . The only downside I've found, is also tied to one of this phone's positive, in that the screen protector which comes pre-installed on the screen of the phone isn't that great. It'll give you some limited protection, but nothing like a tempered glass protector would. Overall, it's my only complaint and if you consider that this comes with the phone at no extra cost, isn't that much of a drawback. There's also the fact that the Mate 10 Pro doesn't have a microSD slot, which you may also need to consider. I highly recommend this phone if you're looking for a flagship level phone which is more affordable than most others in this bracket, yet offers a supreme user experience",NA,"HUAWEI"

"807","B07C6FCC8G",1,"true","As a Chinese who want to support my country and the products that made by my country, I decided to purchase this phone. However, my experience wasn't good. I purchased this phone on March 27th and today is April 17. I took this phone with me today so I can listen music during driving, but when I connect my phone with the cord, it doesn't connect to the speaker in my car, the music actually came out from the phone so I thought maybe the cord was broken. But when I got home and try to connect my phone with the original earphone, same thing happen... and my phone doesn't connect to my computer but only charging the battery. I tried all the method I could and it didn't work. Ended up calling the customers service and they said I have to send my phone to the repair center in Texas. I purchased this phone less than a month and I already need to send it back for repair?? However, after one month of the repair, same problems happen again and I started experiencing problem with the battery since is it getting shorter life. Finally today is Sep 28 and my phone is unable to charge. Try to call the customers service center and they are trying to give me hard time, i never drop or damage my phone but they try to said it was my problem. Trying to get a shipping label for the repair center and they ask me to provide evidence for my phone damage because it is the second time for repair. I mean WTF? I did not do anything wrong with my phone and HUAWEI is blaming on me with my phone problem? Definitely not going to purchase anything from HUAWEI in the future",3,"HUAWEI"
"808","B07C6FCC8G",1,"true","A little background: I have owned pretty much every flagship phone over the last 5 years and many of the Chinese phones from Xiaomi and Huawei, OnePlus, etc. I used to root, mod, custom rom my phones. I know my way around Android and the various skins. Recently, I purchased an Honor View10 from Amazon. It was supposed to be a slightly watered-down version of this phone and it was dual sim and was priced well. I sent it back within a day because I simply could not get notifications for most of my apps. I'm quite versed at how Huawei does this to save battery, as well as the settings to ""Launch"", ""Battery Optimization"", and ""Priority"" that you need to change if you want to get notifications. I was hoping it would be different with the premium version of their phone. I shouldn't have been naive. The build quality and hardware are superb. But this thing is useless as a smartphone. If you actually want to get notifications for your apps, look elsewhere. The reviews are glowing for this phone from many of the bloggers. I can't figure out if they didn't actually use it or if they simply don't need to get notifications. I adjusted every single setting I needed to (again; launch, battery optimization, priority) for all of my apps and when the screen was off, nothing was coming in. Notification light never fired off. I turned on the phone and there was nothing on the lockscreen. I unlocked the phone, opened the email app and manually refreshed and finally got mail (it was set to push). It should not be this way. Ever. And you should not ever have to do this much work to try and get notifications working on a smartphone out of the box anyway. I returned it. This will be the last Huawei device I ever buy. I liked my Mate 8, but only because I rooted that so I could get notifications working (you have to use Titanium Backup to freeze the app that does all of this to save battery life). Xiaomi has something similar on their phones, but once you disable the battery saving features, you actually get notifications. I had the Mi Mix, Mi Mix 2, and Mi Mix 2s. All worked flawlessly. But without root, I can't get a Huawei phone to work the way it should. So be warned.",20,"HUAWEI"

"810","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","this is my preliminary review. I just got this phone (US version w/ $150 gc) 4 hours ago. I've spent the past 3.5 hours with at&t agents trying to get the mobile data to work. The technicians tried numerous ways. The phone got reboot multiple times. After hours of battling it still wouldn't work. When I almost wanted to give up, the data network suddenly started to be working, but only on the 3g network. (One more thing, through out the whole process, there was a switch of ""Enable 4G"" in the mobile network setting. It simply cannot be turned on.) The AT&T agent explained that there is no guarantee the non-AT&T-branded phone would necessarily be able to run on the fastest LTE network, even though the device hardware is compatible. I just don't buy that theory, unless HUAWEI is intentionally selling this phone in the US market with the anticipation that it could only work on the 3g network. I don't believe HUAWEI would do such self-harming thing. Overall the phone is fast and amazing. The one star is mostly for its network connection, which I hope AT&T/HUAWEI could help me resolve eventually. ============================ day1, update: I reached out to HUAWEI support after I was done with AT&T customer service. The HUAWEI representative was patient and suggested me to get a new SIM card to test. I will update my review once I have more information down the road. ============================ day 2, update: went to the AT&T store after work. The staff (Johnson who by the way was nice and patient with me the whole time) inserted his SIM card into my mate 10 pro. Then the 4G LTE worked immediately. It made me to believe that all I need to do was to get a new SIM. However after he put in the new SIM card, the phone still runs on 3G. We then pulled it out and put it in his phone, which got no data at all. (there was some awkward silence). Then he noticed my data plan was the old Share w/ rollover plan. He explained to me it was my plan (thus the SIM) that's causing all this issue. Some phones (like his Moto or mine) will not work with the old plan. Yet iphone, BB or Samsung phones are able to because these phones got something special to boost up their signal. He then tried to convince me that changing my data plan to the latest one would ultimately resolve this issue. I refused and went home with a new SIM card in my phone yet the same issue as 1.5 hours ago. As frustrated and helpless, I decided to do one last testing then I would call it a day. I swapped my SIM card with my wife's iPhone7's (we share the same family plan). I first put her SIM in mine, my phone got 4G LTE!! then my SIM card in hers, her iPhone got 4G LTE too!! I couldn't believed my eyes. I swapped them back, carefully, worrying that I might lose this too-good-to-be-true. Surprisingly my mate 10 pro is running on 4G LTE now. I cannot explain it. Maybe it's the influence of the new SIM kicked in with some time lag. But anyhow it worked. I have since then checked a dozen more times the LTE is still on. Now I changed my rating to 5 stars which this phone deserves.",22,"HUAWEI"
"811","B07C6FCC8G",5,"false","After considering S9+, but learning ""it was not a major upgrade from S8"", I decided to try HUAWEI phones. All I can say is WOW. The construction is solid, the phone feels and looks just solid. The power of Octa-core CPU combined with 6GB of RAM makes it run smooth. But this not what I love the most about it. Here are 3 things that made me love this phone, and make my friends and family seriously consider switching: - Battery life: I will wake up at 6:30 am, unplug the phone, NOT charge it the entire day, and at 11 pm it will still be at around 20 to 40%! Compare: Samsung S8 - needs to be plugged in by about 1 pm. - Camera: Leica lenses and real-time post-processing on the device - the pictures are stunning (especially open aperture mode which dynamically blurs the background for emphasis - wow. Even in the video mode! - No bloatware. This device carries as close to stock Android as you can get on a non-Google device. A few vendor apps of which most could be disabled. There ARE a few drawbacks, but not important for me: - no wireless charging: yes, would be nice to have - no 3mm jack: at some point, it will be a thing of the past - no micro-SD slot. THAT was the biggest disappointment. I had to retire my 256GB card. The phone has 128GB, which is plenty. So for me: bye bye Samsung - it has been a good run, hello HUAWEI. (Full disclosure: I bought this at a local B&H store, not at Amazon).",3,"HUAWEI"

My galaxy S3 just got so slow that I couldn't even take a picture on it without waiting 3+ minutes for the phone to respond. With the mate 10, I just put my finger over the fingerprint scanner and boom everything loads so fast, and the camera on this thing takes such high resolution photos everyone is blown away when they see the pics I've taken. Plus this thing takes photos so fast (without) blurring that sometimes I get people with their eyes closed. Overall, great phone I highly recommend it.",NA,"HUAWEI"

"817","B07C6FCC8G",4,"true","I have been waiting for this phone since its announcement months ago. I'm coming from a Mate 9, Mate 7 before that, and a Mate 2 before that, so I expected to love this phone. I'm not loving it. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful phone and the edge to edge screen is a huge improvement, but for the money I was expecting something better. It's thin, and I love that, and it's faster than the Mate 9, but not as fast as I expected. The 6GB RAM is more than enough, but didn't make a huge appreciable difference except when I was viewing graphic intensive or had multiple apps going. It could be the software, and I'm allowing for that before I decide if I'm keeping it. But the software is a tad glitchy and it froze during some web browsing and lagged a few times in some of my apps. I did NOT expect that from this phone. My apps transferred over within 20 minutes, as did all the usual contacts, pics etc, but nowadays that is the norm and I think most Android users have come to expect a seamless transition to a new device. The sound is good and calls are arguably GREAT with noise cancelling mics. It's still the EMUI, which I don't mind because you can use whatever launcher is your preference...but the setting menus just aren't as improved as I'd hoped for. I think, at this point, the UI should feel more intuitive and polished than it does. The menus are clunky, and a bit confusing. The back is glass...which feels nice but makes me very nervous that I will break it even with a case..or scratch it...Why they cover a phone back in glass is beyond me. The screen is good, but I think it could be more Vibrant. I messed with the display settings and found something better for my personal taste, but still, the screen could look better. It has 128 GB of space...that's plenty for me, so not being expandable isn't a huge deal. I was hoping for wireless charging, and was a little disappointed, though I knew ahead of time so again, not a deal breaker. It's USB Type C...which I prefer. The finger print scanner is super fast and I like the placement square on the back, and not on the front like some. The camera is great and I love the monochrome mode! My cricket Sim worked fine and I haven't had any issues sending or receiving mms. This is a great phone....but it's not as great as I think it could be if Huawei tweaked the software...and it's not as great as I expected for the money from Huawei. That probably sounds cheap, but Huawei knows how to make a great phone cheaper than anyone else. It could just be the software, so I'm willing to give it some time, but this phone left me wondering if maybe I should have bought a one plus 5T, with 8Gb RAM for $300 less? Time will tell. I will update my review in week or sooner if there's something to mention. UPDATE- Day 3 and it's still freezing randomly. I have to reboot to get out of certain apps... Not sure what the conflict is, I haven't been able to pinpoint it yet. Deleted Snapchat and Blink... But still freezing during certain apps. These are the same apps I had on my Mate 9 with no issues and less RAM, so I think it's a software conflict. Update there are still some glitches I don't like. For example when scrolling on a web page regardless of the browser I'm using, it freezes and I have to wait several seconds for it to catch up. Annoying when reading. Also, the screen sometimes spins, and keeps spinning, even though the phone is perfectly stationary. Sometimes when you click on a link nothing happens and you have to close all programs and try again..regardless of the browser or app, and sometimes all I get is a black screen when I wake it up...no pin screen, no fingerprint screen...just blank black screen...again, have to shut everything down. I kept it because I figured Huawei would fix these issues in relatively short order, but still have enough time to return.",6,"HUAWEI"

The OLED display is just very rich and crisp. The camera is a major improvement in low light shots over the mate 9. Not happy about headphone jack being gone, but this seems to be the new direction. Not thrilled about no expandable storage. 128gb is plenty though so this is ok. Overall, this feels like a nice upgrade from the mate 9. I wouldn't have paid $800 for it, but at $650, I am happy.

"824","B07C6FCC8G",5,"true","I love my phone it is amazing what I dont love is the price war over colors because what is the first thing you do when you get a glass phone? You put a cover on it for protection. Check this out, If you buy Diamond black it is $797.61 or midnight blue is$ 689.89 then the mocha brown is $389.00 and grey is $6.92.99 What is wrong with people paying double or triple for a color. I did some research and the black is a porsche design. but the others are all exactly the same. Ok another issue I had was I got the first phone from Maxproductsales next day 2nd day shipping. and had to send it back it was super hot when you plugged it in and you could not hear me when I talked on it, and the phone would cut in and out. So I sent it back and got the huawie p 30 lite from Purple Passion and as soon as I opened the box and picked up the phone I put it right back in and it went back to UPS in 13 minutes It was plastic and I did not like it at all so I reordered the HUAWEI mate 10 PRO and Made sure I got it from a different seller THE Tech GROUP It came with a charge and I went right to you tube and watched all the tricks and things the phone could do and I am still learning. BUT WARNING, my first phone was the Huawei mate se and I loved it so much but it fell onto the black payment and cracked so bad it is now useless. so I brought it to be fixed and it costs 350.00 to fix it and if you go to ebay or here amazon it is brand new for under 160.00. but let me tell you it is absolutely worth every penny. the only reason I did not get the same one is because I thought I was going to have this one fixed and have a spare phone and also I never ever get anything for myself I always do for someone else and this time I said it is time for me to get something nice. But it did take me two weeks to hit the pay button I can get things for others but when it comes to me I have a hard time spending the money. but this money was well spent and I would get it again.

"876","B07CMBB6PH",3,"true","This phone was a good value at $250 but is an even bigger steal at the current price of $214. I never even bothered to use a case; there's something liberating about using a phone that's practically a disposable item. I never have understood the appeal of high-priced phones. A phone is a tool that goes with you everywhere and gets exposed to all manner of mishaps. In my opinion, phones are not the kind of item that one should ever spend big on. Save the big bucks for items that aren't in danger of being dropped or ruined every day, like your TV, for example. Ok rant over. Pros: Very lightweight and narrow (easy to use one-handed), good quality screen, acceptable Android performance thanks to the decent CPU and 4GB RAM, surprisingly good photos, beautiful aesthetics especially in the blue color. Cons: Small bezels make accidental touch inputs a constant annoyance, though this is true for all ""bezel-less"" phones. Apps can sometimes glitch out or lag slightly, but again, this is true of many Android devices that cost twice as much.",NA,"HUAWEI"

Maybe I misread the phone specs so I'm not really mad it just slightly disappointing. Besides that, I love this phone. I previously had a Samsung and it definitely tops that. This camera is amazing! Front and back. Selfie game is strong. I would definitely recommend this phone. For the price you cannot go wrong. I waited till the battery died after setting it up to charge it and the first charge took foreverrrrrr. I'm hoping it's because it was first time and this isn't the length of time it usually takes. It took about 4 hours so I will edit my review after a couple of charges. UPDATE: The phone definitely does not take long to charge. An hour tops...it is great. It charges really quick and the battery life is not that bad. Compared to my Samsung it is okay.

It DOES NOT support 4G and you'll only be able to use up to the speed of 2G, which practically makes the phone useless. Another warning: there is no support or warranty for this phone. I went to Huawei store in Shenzhen China, the support engineers did take a look. But when they can't diagnose the issue, I was simply told that this is the oversea model and need to be serviced at the oversea Huawei store. Are you kidding me? There are no Huawei stores in the U.S. So a piece of advice: do NOT buy Huawei oversea models. It's treated as second class and you have no support/warranty in China.

"900","B07CMBB6PH",4,"false","I used the P20 Lite for about two weeks before deciding to upgrade to the Mate 10 Pro. I'll explain my reasons more later, but first, the pros and cons of the P20 Lite. Pros: - GREAT fingerprint and face recognition software. Even in very low light, face recognition worked about 90% of the time, which is impressive. - Good build quality. While it doesn't feel premium when compared hands-on with a truly premium smartphone, when isolated, it feels very nice. Also, it is extremely light. Unbelievably so, the box almost felt like nothing when I first received it. I prefer a weightier phone, but for many, this would be a pro, so I'll list it as such. - Good cell reception in New York City. I never had issues finding coverage. This is the international model, so I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but AT&T service was great. - Great camera for everyday use. Obviously not as good as the flagships, but I had no problems with the photographs I snapped for everyday sharing. Cons: - Not great battery life. This is one of the reasons I ultimately sent it back... I just expected more from a 3,000+mah battery. - While 4gb of ram is average, you notice a difference when compared to a 6gb phone, which is becoming more common. - No 5ghz wifi connectivity. This annoyed me because I couldn't use my phone as a remote for my smart tv, because they have to be connected to the same wifi channel, and my tv is always connected to my 5ghz wifi service. My phone, however, could only connect to the 2ghz wifi. This alone wasn't a dealbreaker, but it was certainly irritating to find out. Like I said, I decided to upgrade to the Mate 10 Pro for (1) a 4,000mah battery and (2) specific US-based coverage (even though I had no issues in and around New York, I travel a bit, so I wanted to make sure I had a phone with cellular bands tailored for North American use). The P20 Lite is worth the price I paid ($280), but it just wasn't right for me. I certainly recommend it to someone who doesn't care about having only 4gb of ram and no 5ghz wifi connectivity, which is probably the majority of people.",2,"HUAWEI"
"901","B07CMBB6PH",5,"false","I traded a 128GB Google Pixel for this phone locally. It was new in the box. Right away I noticed it was lighter than my Galaxy S8, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I have the black model and I couldn't believe that the glass back wasn't a fingerprint magnet. I'm writing this review from the P20 Lite and when I'm done the back will be fairly clean. The device is a bit slippery though so you might want a case of some sort. Second thing I noticed was the display. I compared it to my S8 and aside from the Galaxy having better viewing angles the quality of the P20s IPS screen was really good, it was nearly as good as the S8. It gets really bright too. This phone comes stock with a SwiftKey keyboard, which is awesome. Features. There are A TON of features. Integrated diagnostics, a game launcher, I could go on for days. The Huawei skin over Android, EMUI, is fairly light and intuitive. If you don't mind iOS you won't mind EMUI. Needless to say it's not a stock Android experience but that's ok, it's not bogged down with garbage apps. The customization level within the software was great. The cameras are good, I give them a 7/10. I'm coming from a Pixel though so I'm spoiled. Overall this phone is a great deal. It looks great, it's rather snappy, lots of cool features, decent cameras, ample customization options, good RAM management.

"908","B07CMBB6PH",4,"true","4.5 out of 5. So I come from an iPhone perspective and I've had this phone for about a week now and feel I can give a fair review. About two weeks ago my iPhone 5S was dying out only lasting 2 hours out of full charge I bought that phone brand new in 2012 for $600 my instant reflex was just to go get an iPhone X currently $1200 for the model I wanted. I don't like financing phones and that was a bit rich for my blood so I started looking for cheaper alternatives and all of a sudden BEHOLD the Huawei P20 Lite! As a long term iPhone user had the 4 before my 5s I was hesitant to jump to Android but a review of the MATE SE also from Huawei made it seem like emui was very similar to iOS and guess what IT IS! Emui has made my switch so easy! I do miss imessage the most but slowly getting over it. Emui 5/5 This phone is so much faster than my 5s obviously 2012 phone compared to a 2018 phone but I'm still impressed with what this phone has to offer! And this is the section where Ill talk bout this phone specifically.... Pretty much bezel-less (full screen to bezel ratio) with a lookalike iPhone X notch! 5/5 on the screen imo super bright and vivid with fullHD although a bit glaring in the sun but not a deal breaker especially with max brightness you'll get by. Finger ID so responsive works flawlessly another 5/5 if you'd like facial recognition to unlock your phone that's also an option USB C Port with fast charging 5/5 Cameras 3/5 the cameras are what you'd expect from a midrange budget phone they work its HD but just something about it is not as good even my 5S had just as clear shots Overall everything has been great not sure what I forgot to mention but just ask and I'll let you know my opinion!

The screen looks decent and the notch isn't as big of deal-breaker as most people assume it to be. Battery (owned for less than 3 days) is pretty good especially when there are heavier and more pricey mobiles out there with smaller - yes, SMALLER - batteries. It does come with some random apps which you can easily delete and have plenty of space left.

"951","B07CMBB6PH",5,"true","I purchased this product from Virtual Depot, I must say they were excellent in communicating with me the delivery options and accommodating my request. As for the phone itself, the MAJOR flaw as I can see is the absence of 5g wifi. This causes severe interference with the Bluetooth when it is activated as it shares the same antenna. Every time I use both the wifi and Bluetooth I get poor network connection alerts so I have to disable Bluetoothin order to correct this. Another issue seems to be the absence of Wifi calling which is a good feature that I have on my other phone, the ZTE Blade Z Max, at a fraction of the price of this allegedly superior set. I will make a decision whether to keep this otherwise very good looking and handy phone or return it and stay with my current set, with its limitations and all. Update 6/2 Phone is excellent. Nothing comes close. I am keeping it. Perhaps someone knows how to use the slo mo video recording which is a nice surprise feature",9,"HUAWEI"

The overall look of even the lock screen highly resembles an iPhone X so that's nice, it's also very customizable. In addition it has facial recognition which works amazingly. Oddly though, if you go into trusted CA or whatever in your security option, you will be met by either companies or research centers who are able to in a way moniter your phone. I joke you not, *Japanese Government * is literally one of those options. I ran through and turned off tons of those options bc they either involved international governments or businesses. Overall a great phone, but if your privacy really matters to you, be careful with this phone. Also, as mentioned in the headline it does work with GSM carriers.

"1011","B07CMBB6PH",4,"true","I generally steer away from buying apple, Samsung, or Google products, so one of the major brands I was left with was Huawei. I did a lot of research into which one I should buy and a settled on the p20 lite. Ever since I bought it it has been an absolute pleasure to use. The android skin is one of the best I've used so far, the cameras are amazing, and the speed in most applications is great too. One thing that does happen, however is the phone will freeze. It only happens like once every 2 or 3 months, but still an issue. Also snapchat is terrible on it, but that is no fault of Huawei, it seems to be an optimization issue that only snapchat itself can fix. The only thing I wish they did differently was make the battery more accessible because I might need to replace it in a year or so. Also love the headphone jack!",1,"HUAWEI"

The sensitivity of the finger touch and the touch screen is great. The display is great and so is the sound output. I don't run many apps or use wi-fi for too long so can't comment about the battery life but anyway I recharge my phone every 2 days. The only glitch which I have come across so far is that sometimes when I switch on the bluetooth the phone hangs (I discovered this accidentally since bluetooth is pretty much obsolete these days). The phone is extremely light and sleek and doesn't seem a burden to carry. If you are looking for a low budget phone with great specs..this might be a compelling option!!",3,"HUAWEI"

My kids have Samsung and Apple flagships while the dad has a $250 phone...yet I do everything they do and in a year when it's time to upgrade, I'll still be ahead of them financially! The only thing I don;t like about this phone is that it's not waterproof...but oh well...if I drop it in the water, I can always replace it with a new one and won't have to worry about insuring it...which is another expense tied to the GS8 and iPhone.",2,"HUAWEI"
"1015","B07CMBB6PH",4,"true","I bought this phone around 4 or 5 months ago and it's a pretty nice mid range phone. This sakura pink color looks a lot better in person. It's a bit lighter than what the renders show. It also has a glittery effect. I love the design and it has some pretty great cameras too. The selfie cam is probably one of the best I've used in a while and you can even do bokeh effect on it. Low light shots are pretty decent on both front and back cameras. My only gripe about the phone is the processor. It will stutter and lag for about 3 seconds. It already froze on me a couple of times to the point of where I had to reset it. EMUI isn't the best launcher either but of course you can cha ge that by downloading a launcher from the play store. After the April security update, gesture navigation is also enabled so you won't have to use the on screen soft keys to navigate around the phone. If it wasn't for the huawei ban, I'd definitely recommend this phone. It's uncertain whether or not this phone will get the EMUI 9/Android Pie update so it's still stuck on oreo.

It is updated with Android 8. 0 currently. The camera takes great photos. Network reception is top-notch. Looks just like an iPhone x LOL at least the kids are fool for a while. That being said they have two other P90 models the one I will call regular, and the pro series.

Screen is bright and vivid. Unlocked in USA T-mobile so far reception is just as good as my other phone. The camera is amazing outside, it's just OK in low light.

I had a lot going on and didnt have the time to return the phone. Pros: Phone doesnt lag and works pretty good for the price Fingerprint and Face unlock works really well Screen quality is good Cons: Camera is not that great.

"1020","B07CMBB6PH",3,"true","Soo... This is my second Huawei, had the first one for 2 years and the only reason I decided to change it is cause it was super slow for obvious reasons. I was thinking on getting an iPhone even though I'm not a fan of apple but at the end what made me decide for the Huawei was the screen. In the two years I had my last phone, I dropped it countless times and nothing ever happened, so that was it for me. After 2 months I accidentally dropped my Huawei p20 lite (with a case on), and the screen is completely shattered... Like bad, this never happened to any of the phones I had before. So here I am feeling like an iPhone owner with a shattered screen. The area where the front camera is, is shattered too, depending on the light I can take nice or decent pictures. Besides that, the phone is okay, no lagging after 2 months of use. The camera during day time is pretty good but if you're using it at night or without good light conditions is terrible. *Update: Now the main camera is shattered too and I don't even know how! I'm so frustrated, I really regret spending my money on this phone!! Could blame the case but it's the same style of case I used for my previous phone and it was never a problem!!",6,"HUAWEI"

To be fair, I did not have protective screen or case on the phone, but none of my previous phones had any cases either and they definitely took some beating throughout years of usage.

I love the fact it has expandable storage but still, without access to my daily apps it's gonna have to be a no from me. Perhaps there was a work around to this app issue but on the first day, having problems is a bad sign. Returning it but can't help but say I wish I would have been able to use it.

I was just concerned at first that maybe someone had returned it before because there was something wrong. I've used it for a couple days and it's been working quite well i think for the price you can't complain if it doesn't take pictures or have the preformance of a more epensive phone. Without regarding price the camera takes good pictures in strong light and when held steady it has quite a bit of noise in dimmer indoor light and when not being held completely steady I think most of the noise a blur comes from not having ois also not having ois makes videos Shaky. Next is charging not having a Qualcomm CPU means no qc2.0 or 3.0 so now all my qc3.0 chargers will charge extremely slow and the only way around this is to buy a official Huawei fast chargers and even then the phone only pulls at most 1.8amps and is usually at around 1.3amps compared to my old phone with qc3.0 which would pull 3.0 amps.

Most of the time I will speak my message, nothing comes up for say around 4 seconds, then pops in place and have to restart the voice process (just takes a finger touch) again. Second most dislike. Definitely finds sounds everywhere, so make sure for eg. the TV sound is off. I may not know a better place, but to start the voice message you have a itty bitty place to start it, which is on the key pad that comes up. And if you do not hit it long enough or exactly on the spot all you get is a bunch of ....... This feature I really dislike the most. Takes, what appears, very good pictures. Crisp voice on incoming calls, and others say to me can hear me clearly. On my phone anyway, there are three boxes with numerous apps on them, and one must hit this box, then hit app. One is google, one is tools, and one is top apps. Play store and settings is on the top apps. Mild pain to remember what each one has in them. Have not figured out yet how to give phone more time before it shuts itself off automatically. Sometimes 5-6 seconds is not long enough. Seems loud enough. Battery life, in my opinion, is excellent. There are couple other mild things I wish was better such as on the bottom you have for eg. the back arrow, Nice and crisp when turn it on, but when you get a site you want on the phone the back arrow all but disappears and you kind of have to guess where it is at. There are many likes (can go to foreign country and not have to take out my provider sim lte, because have two areas that can use. Is unlocked which I really like. Screen is very nice size.

"1230","B07CMBB6PH",4,"true","First I have to say I love this phone. I had the p8 lite for a little while but decided I wanted a newer phone. Now I can't see my self buying anything other than Hawuei phones. EMUI is a smooth overlay and the phone is great for the price. My one complaint is that it isn't the best for games because of the older cpu used. It will play games without issue but sometimes you have to lower settings. I hear there is an update planned to fix that issue tho!",1,"HUAWEI"
"1231","B07CMBB6PH",5,"true","I'll have a full review with photos incoming, but here are the basic pros and cons: Pros: Beautiful design that stands out. Notch display design allows for a high screen to body ratio and more usable screen area on a compact body. Feels sturdy in the hand. Good tactile feel of buttons. Quick and accurate fingerprint scanner. Display is vivid without looking oversaturated and bright enough to use in all but direct sunlight. Notch never intrudes on content. Good cameras. Very strong CPU performance. Good battery life. Cons: Glass back is more prone to damage, necessitates extra careful handling or use of protective cases. No water resistance. Single band WiFi. Weak GPU performance.

"1232","B07CMBB6PH",5,"true","There is a reason Huawei has knocked Apple out of 2nd place without even being sold in the USA, They built a high quality product that works incredibly well and does just about anything the high priced flagship phones and does it all at just a fraction of the price! Build Quality is second to none, camera is insane! It takes incredible photos in any lighting. It is fast and has a battery that lasts all day with fairly heavy use. The facial recognition is faster than the iPhone x and accurate. The fingerprint sensor is located on the upper rear of the phone on the P20 light as opposed to the front on the P20 Pro. After having phones with sensors in both places, I prefer the rear as your finger just naturally falls into the spot naturally. The facial recognition is so fast though it actually unlocks sometimes before you can use your fingerprint! Another feature this phone has that most other high-end phones such as the iPhone and Samsung don't have is an SD card slot. Being able to upgrade your memory is priceless. The cost of SD cards is so low anymore you can take a few with you on vacation and not worry about running out of space for all your HD videos and photos. Software and firmware updates are rolled out frequently and Huawei support is always great which is amazing since they aren't sold in the USA. You are currently forced to purchase an unlocked international version. If they were available for sale locally in the United States, there is no doubt that they would be the best selling phones. One last thing, when you purchase these, you don't end up with tons of bloat ware from AT&T or Tmobile etc. You get a nicely skinned clean version of Android that gets upgraded often. You don't need to worry about your carrier rolling out updates. AT&T deliberately holds back updates in order to slow down your phone and make you want to upgrade to the latest and greatest version of Android or whatever OS you have. Display is great with vivid colors and crystal clear even in bright sunlight. I can go on and on about how great this company is and how great their products are but you really need to give them a try. I truly believe you will not be disappointed. You will be recommending them to everyone you meet though and you will become a fan boy or fangirl!",111,"HUAWEI"

"1236","B07CMBB6PH",5,"true","I have been an apple user for a long time. Of course as many apple freaks know everytime there is an update the phone seems to slow. I was so sick and tired of my iPhone 6plus. The battery wouldn't even last me a half a day even with power saver mode on. Everything was lagging, but I wasn't willing to invest hundreds of dollars for another iphone. I did alot of research on Huawei and all the youtube reviews and tech websites seemed to agree. My husband has the Samsung 9 and this phone holds up just as good compared to this. The pictures are by far better, sharper, and vibrant then my iPhone ever was. I have a Google hub and because this is Android everything is so much easier and synched. Google is kicking ass hands down and being able to access my goodle home and assistant makes my life a breeze. I was concerned switching from the iPhone ios to Android but it was so simple with the app provided in the setup. I have had this phone for a few months and I am so happy. For the price and quality you can't go wrong. Also battery life is amazing, I have not charged my phone since 7:00 am and it is now 11:00pm and I am still at 50%. I use me phone alot so this to me is the best selling point of this phone.... Oh and it charges sooooo fast.

With only 32GB Internal Storage/4GB RAM Memory and the option for expandable storage via Micro SD card up to 128GB this phone is ok ish but thanks to Huawei's ""EMUI"" software plus a ton ton of junk bloatware it slows the phone down like crazy even with some of it being deleted it's still just bad bad!..",22,"HUAWEI"

"1242","B07CMBB6PH",4,"true","I'm giving 4 starts to whoever did the poor packing, no bubble wrap, the product came bouncing inside the box. Besides that Huawei P20 won Smartphone of the Year award by EISA, and indeed it's a great phone! I've had the phone for 4 days and it already paid off my investment. I've always had good experiences with Huawei phones. They have unique features, great operation systems and a very great product for its value. It is the best cost/benefit phone in my opinion. If you don't bother playing high demanding games or taking ultra professional pictures, go with P20 Lite instead of the P20 Pro because the Lite version will work as good, fast qnd smooth as the Pro version.",11,"HUAWEI"
"1243","B07CMBB6PH",1,"true","Alright. I'm going to give it to you straight. I did not like the service (From Huawei, Amazon did pretty good in giving me a refund). I bought the phone it had a delivery date. Didn't show up on delivery date and delivery date moved to another date (at least 3 days) didn't arrive on that either. Filed a refund and well I got it. Reordered the same phone. Came next day. I got it and tried setting it up. Then when it booted up the logo would appear the screen would dim to Black and the logo would appear again. Did this a couple of time until I tried hard resetting, I factory reset it. IT DID NOT WORK AT ALL. I sent it back and got a refund. From Amazon not from Huawei. I reordered it again. And as of right now same situation. It felt like they just resent the same broken phone twice. I honestly got nothing else to say besides avoid trying to buy the phone. If you do that's fine, if it doesn't work send it back and get a refund from Amazon. Also make sure the phone is new (mine was supposedly new, felt like a cheap old broken one). If you never get the phone get an Amazon associate to mark it as lost and get a refund. IDK why I had this many problems for a defective product? But I did and now y'all know. Try it out is all I can say but just be cautious. I tried the phone again today Nov,5th 2018 and I thought I got the problem figured but I guess I was wrong. It kept rebooting and wouldn't stop. Currently sending the note to get another refund",10,"HUAWEI"

"1245","B07CMBB6PH",1,"true","We purchased a Huawei P20 phone in August 2018. The phone will no longer charge and it is NOT the charger or cord as multiple other cords/chargers were tried. TechnoMaster (the seller), nor Amazon will honor any warranty. Huawei is telling us the phone is an ""international"" Huawei phone, meaning it was not made by the USA division of Huawei and therefore, Huawei will not honor the 12 month warranty on their phone! In other words, we blew $300 on a phone that lasted four months. This is horrible business practice and we will NEVER purchase an unlocked phone from Amazon or any third party again.

But as soon as I got it, I started not receiving all my calls and messages would come in with a delay of 1-2 hours. I finally talked to Huawei and they told me that this phone is only supposed to be an international model not meant for the USA or Canada because it doesn't run on the same bandwidths so you're never going to have decent service. Yeah. Amazon doesn't say any of this in the listing. Bottom line: I returned the phone and got my money back.",6,"HUAWEI"

"1248","B07CMBB6PH",5,"true","This phone gives you one of the best cost vs benefit ratio you could get from latest smartphones. My wife and I replaced our old Samsung Galaxy Express 3 with P20 Lite (pink for my wife and blue for myself). Major problems of the Galaxy devices were 1. it had only 8GB RAM which kept us from installing apps after a few and 2. the performance was getting slower over a few years. These two combined irritated us significantly and we decided to buy new ones that were less than $500 a piece with at least 32 GB memory. We both are casual users of smartphones, so we didn't need high-end lineups of Samsung and others. Overall, we are very happy with the phones and assured that we wouldn't need more expensive devices. Below are a couple of tips that future buyers may want to know in advanace. 1. Replacing SIM from the Galaxy devices to P20 Lite phones was quite easy. We live in North Carolina, USA and we are users of AT&T Prepaid. So, we stopped by an AT&T store. The sales person did it quickly. He also kindly replaced the 32GB external SD card from the Galaxy devices to Huawei's for us. The phones started working instantly. I guess you could do it yourself. 2. The phone looks super sleek. It's slightly thinner and lighter than the Galaxy device. It's longer in height but still fits in wife's and my hand very well. The blue and pink colors both look fantastic. 3. The 32GB storage is large enough for us. I have installed several apps that I wanted to use but couldn't with the Galaxy device and the phone still has almost 14GB remaining. 4. The performance is wonderful. 5. The camera is way more amazing than we expected. It takes pictures that would look like those taken by a pro even inside the home at night. Now I really think my wife no longer needs a compact digital camera. There are a lot of nice features such as panoramic shots, pictures with a blurred background that look taken by a DSLR camera (I have a Nikon D7200). There are a couple of small cons. 1. Some of the pre-installed apps are less sophisticated than those in the Galaxy device. For example, the interface for setting time in Calendar and Clock apps are very old fashion. You have to scroll, say, from 0, 1, 2 to 28, 29, 30 minutes. Notepad is OK but one thing I miss is that I can't add a title which I could with the Galaxy's. The Galaxy's had a nice Visual voicemail app but the Huawei's does not. Pre-installed Huawei apps may not work in the US. For example, when I open AppGallery, it says ""unavailable in this country/region"". Since I don't use them, it's not a big problem, anyway. 2. This may not be a problem of the Huawei device but a problem of Android 8. Anyway, when I connect the device to my HONDA CR-V (2013) via bluetooth, the song info is not refreshed after one or a few songs were played. It may be the issue of AVRCP but I can't find a way to downgrade AVRCP as someone suggested online. 3. This is not an issue of P20 Lite itself but I have a CASHIO G-SHOCK with a radio controlled time adjustment feature. It seems this feature is disturbed by P20 Lite device. It was used working with the Galaxy device but since I got P20 Lite phone, the G-SHOCK fails to adjust the time when the phone is placed nearby. Now I know there is a political issue between Huawei and western countries including my home country Japan. I don't want to touch on this in this review. Only thing I hope is that the issue is solved peacefully and Huawei phones can keep available over the world as they are such excellent products. EDIT: Regarding #3 above, it turned out that placing the device a little bit behind my G-SHOCK does solve the issue. My watch has to sit facing toward the window. When the device is placed near the watch and closer to the window than the watch, it would disturb the radio controlled time adjustment. But when it is placed farther from the window than the watch even if both sit next each other, the time adjustment seems to work fine.",4,"HUAWEI"

But is still wanted a solid phone and this is the answer! Looks gorgeous, good build quality, no problems with signal or wifi, has amazing new features that my iPhone or Samsung didn't have like cloning an app.and the battery life is awesome, camera is great! For this price you can't get better than this. Now keep in mind probably the camera and display quality is no t going to match your iPhone xs or note 9 coz they are 700 more expensive.",4,"HUAWEI"

However, as others have stated - no 5GHz is a bit annoying (we've disabled all 2.4GHz at work due to interference with wireless headsets). Also, it's slippery! It slid out of my pocket within the first few hours of me receiving it. I should have bought a case before using the phone, as now I've got giant cracks front/rear of this phone. There are a few other quirks that I'm trying to work around (like disabling the Swiftkey keyboard), but otherwise, happy with it. Good improvement from my 2014 OnePlus One",5,"HUAWEI"

"1438","B07J4Z9647",5,"true","I needed to upgrade from my 16GB iPhone 6s for space and just couldn't rationalize the cost of even upgrading to a used iPhone 8. I was nervous to switch to Android, so I certainly didn't want a cheap phone to be the cause of my frustration, but the whole point of switching was to save money. This phone's specs blew the same-price competitors away and was within my price range. So far I'm very happy with it (1 month). Speedy, good looking, responsive... really no complaints as far as not doing what I need versus my iPhone. I connect to my car via an external bluetooth, attaching my phone to a mounted magnet for use (I have an older vehicle that doesn't have built-in bluetooth and screen). I only stream music (never use the car's radio/cd player) and I use maps frequently... everything has worked flawlessly. Phone calls have been clear using the phone's headset, speaker and bluetooth. Quality check with friends: everyone says I sound just as clear as I did on my iPhone in all scenarios. I've had no dropped calls and 4G works fine on AT&T. Signal isn't as great in my house (1-2 bars), but my calls have still been perfect. Battery lasts twice as long as my iPhone (and I replaced the battery on it a few months ago, getting the same battery life as I did when new). I can easily get a full day, play white noise overnight, and get through most of a second day. Charging is super fast. I think my biggest concern was the camera, and there are definitely pros and cons. Huawei gets grainy quicker in low light situations vs iPhone, BUT it also does a better job making low light pics look brighter. Pics that simply wouldn't turn out on the iPhone will turn out on Huawei, although grainy. In better light, pics are very similar. Huawei also has a lot of cool picture options that the iPhone didn't have, so overall I'm happy with it. I think I actually like the video quality better on Huawei, especially screen resolution. I get a much wider shot. Videos are very sharp with bright colors and clear sound. Regarding Android: Huawei includes a number of apps of their own that can't be deleted, but I think it's pretty minimal as far as bloatware goes. I got Nova Launcher from the Play Store, so my home screen is totally customized... which has gotten me hooked on Android now! For anyone else switching from iPhone, this is a must! You can choose custom icons for your apps, double up apps (I have my camera app, but then I just slide up on the app to open my photo viewer instead of having that app on the screen; same with FB and Messenger - tap or slide one icon, the two communication apps my kids' teachers use, etc). This seriously reduces clutter! The widgets are super awesome too. I have my music streaming set up as a widget and can control most of it through the home screen now. I also have weather and time (larger print is much easier to use than the little clock on the top, and I can tap on the time to open the timer and the weather to open my weather app). My messaging app is also set up as a widget so I can see my most recent texts at a glance. You can also create rapid dial widgets, so I have 2 groups with custom icons for most common friends and family, so I rarely have to use my dialer's contact list or navigate to favorites now. The downside to Android, though, is that all the stuff that comes standard on Apple isn't standard... so many dialer, voicemail, messaging, and keyboard apps, and the crappy one's are useless and full of ads. It's a total time-suck finding what works! To possibly save you some time: I use the Huawei dialer and Visual Voicemail (customize to open when I swipe up on the dialer app). I use Pulse for messaging - it works flawlessly and syncs on multiple devices (I loved using iMessage on my Mac and had no issues migrating to Pulse), plus it is super reasonably priced unlike others that want $80/year subscriptions... might as well get an iPhone at that rate! I liked Digital Clock Xperia as my time, date and weather widget. SwiftKey Keyboard is my favorite, although I don't think it's quite as intuitive as Apple, but has other customization options that balance it out. Definitely order a new case - the clear one that comes with it if cheap. It'll prevent scratches, but I doubt there's any shock absorption in falls. The choices were limited when I purchased this because it's a new model, but I went with Spigen Rugged Armor. I also ordered a 3 pack of 6' type c cables. The Supershieldz screen protector didn't work (air gap around the edges and loosened after a few weeks, effecting touch screen sensitivity, but at that point peeled off very easily).",172,"HUAWEI"

Follow page 2 of https://forum.xda-developers.com/mate-20-pro/help/issues-receiving-calls-text-t3869291/ to download QuickShortcutMaker app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sika524.android.quickshortcut&hl=en_US to find wi-fi calling activity and disable it. 2. With the latest OS update, I found that wifi hotspot causes 06 Mbps slow download. upload is about 10Mbps. There is some kind of bug in the hotspot feature. [Pros] 1. I thought I had to buy Huawei Mate 20 to really find a competitive phone compared to the most expensive 2018 iPhone. I already have a Ticwatch c2 with Google pay so I was reluctant to spend $600 for the Mate 20 which has NFC. This LITE version does not have NFC for Google pay. But the price offered here is excellent. A review says 1080p at 60fps makes soft video but I'd barely change video settings and don't need to use any video over 1080p. The camera isn't as good as Mate 20 in low light but that's something I can tolerate. 5 stars to the price. 2. the 12 nm Kirin 710 processor isn't as bad as I thought. Geekbench 4 score of 1600 is comparable to Snapdragon 660's near 1640. I don't feel slowness Opening apps except I heard games maybe slow. iPhone's A12 processors are known to have high geekbench score and optimized for gaming. If you check company emails, social media, G suite, online banking, make calls, do video conferencing, you wouldn't feel a difference. 3. Face unlock and printer unlock are seamless. Face unlock may have difficulties in complete darkness. I like the feature to wake the phone when I pick it for better face unlock experience. Headphone jack is great for not needing an extra adapter to plug the headsets. I don't use Bluetooth headsets so having a headphone jack is important to me.",2,"HUAWEI"

"1465","B07J4Z9647",5,"true","Just purchased this phone a few days ago and Huawei hit a home run with this phone. Coming from a Huawei Nexus 6P phone which I owned for 3 years, this phone blows it away. In my opinion, this phone with a glass back is as just good as any premium $1,000 android phone. The phone is very fast opening apps and with the 6.3 inch screen size, watching videos is like having a high def. TV. The software (both android 8.1 and EMUI) has many features and operation is very smooth with no hesitation. Phone calls are loud and clear. No drop calls with T-Mobile. The battery life is unbelievable. I just got three days and two nights with 12% left of battery life (light to moderate use including phone calls, Iheart radio, youtube, facebook and texting, but no games). The camera with AI takes really good photos, especially selfies. Video's are good too, but no 4K. For the $299.00 price (plus I got $70 credit with the Amazon Visa card with no fees) it was a fantastic deal. Like I said, the best phone for the best price. Also, comes with a case and screen protector. The only complaint is that I wish the placement of the fingerprint sensor was just a 1/4 inch lower because it is too close to the camera bumps. However, you won't be disappointed with this phone. I will update my experience next month. Update One Month Later: After one month with this phone, I am loving it. It is the best phone I have ever owned (I loved my previous phone the Nexus 6P ,but had battery issues). First of all, the battery is amazing. No, I don't get three full days, but definitely 2 full days with moderate use and still 10% left. If you want up to three days you can use the regular battery saver setting or you can use the ultra saver setting for maybe four days or longer. Again, unless you watch video's all day, you will never have to carry a battery charger with you for daily use. The processor is very fast and the phone never heats up during use. Wifi connection is excellent and I haven't dropped a call yet using T-Mobile. And, yes you do get 4G LTE service with T-Mobile and it is very fast. But, it doesn't have the new T-Mobile Band 71 or 700mhz. Like I said it still connects very well with T-Mobile in the USA. The AI makes amazing regular and selfie photos with this phone (easy just to point and shoot). It does have some bloatware with Huawei EMUI, but it does not affect the performance of the phone. Also, I would definitely purchase a screen protector and case for the phone due to the glass back is very slippery. Overall, it is a beautiful phone and I still give it 5 stars. As I stated before, you cannot purchase a better phone for the price. Excellent value.",6,"HUAWEI"

The screen is absolutely terrible. Screen is black and cannot read at all while wearing my prescription sunglasses (due to polarization I believe) even indoors at max brightness. I thought it might be a bad screen protector, so I removed it & still no luck. It's lighter, and looks & feels cheap.

"1470","B07J4Z9647",5,"true","Phone arrived yesterday. I bought Unlocked International Huawei Mate 20 Lite for foreign travel but decided to try it with AT&T here in LA. It works flawlessly with no connection problems that I read on reviews elsewhere - the IMEI number was in AT&T system as exactly this model. Speed and function of OS and apps is great - I did not opt for most of the Huawei apps. Although this is the only the ""lite"" Mate 20 version the dual rear camera has stunning night mode photo results. I only wish it had a warranty in the US - just in case. It is also working with Walmart Straight Talk and I get better connectivity than with my Samsung S7 Edge on Verizon.",1,"HUAWEI"
"1471","B07J4Z9647",4,"true","So, basically, it is a nice phone. Screen is good, the process to open and close phone is good. Face recognition is okay, but is always actively searching for your face and does not unlock unlock the screen, it just says the screen is unlocked now, and you have to physically swipe up to open the phone. So, it's annoying at points. But the lock screen changes photos every time you unlock it, which is pretty cool. Comes with some bloatwear but not a lot. Has room for you to configure the apps and lets you move the icons around. Connectivity is good! I can load pages on the go now! Except, like others have said, it does not run on 4G LTE via t-mobile. It does go 4G though which is good enough for me. Now I don't have to use the free slow wifi at work. Camera is nice! Except for when taking pictures for instagram via the app. The quality of the picture goes down and image shrinks for some reason. Which takes me to the notch. The notch isn't that annoying. It's what it is. It's there to tell us which side is up, I guess. Ringtones are cool, but I don't use them. So, the vibrate mode is good but loud! I like it though! I can hear it then. It does have a little notification light that lights up to tell you you have messages or something. Now the keyboard, the only thing that is annoying about it is that the space bar is toooooooooooooooo close to the home circle. When I go to hit space, my thumb hits the home button too because my hands are kind of stubby. So, they gotta work on that. The screen protector that came with it, sucks because I tried to put it on, and it created air bubbles that would not go away. Battery life can only be in the good range if the power saving mode is on! Like with out it, the battery drains like crazy. I don't know why but it just does. This phone is not for super heavy use. I just update my social media apps and 1% some how drops as I look at it for a few minutes. So, there might be apps running in the background I do not know about. Downloading stuff uses battery power too! Playing videos, full screen is full but not where the notch area is. So, it does not get in the way of watching videos on youtube. And in power saving mode, the display is kind of knocked down to help conserve energy. YAY! Let's be more eco friendly no? Unboxing, I was a little skeptical if it was new because the plastic on the screen was crooked but whatever, I'll probably change it in a year or two because of the newer cameras coming out. Well, that's about all I have, I'll update in about a week how things are going!! UPDATE: So It has been 3 days and the battery on power saving mode is still going strong! Also, the phone likes to fall a sleep sometimes and not wake up where the power button comes in handy. Also, face detection is always on while holding the phone but when placed down, it will not recognize your face. Also, if it starts falling a sleep, just rock it.",NA,"HUAWEI"

I absolutely LOVED the Mate SE. Everything worked quite well and the software was amazing! Once I realized that I wanted to stick to Huawei, I ordered the Mate 20 Lite. I wanted the bigger screen, USB-C, bigger battery, updated software, and better camera. The software on the Mate 20 Lite is a suite of useful Huawei features called Huawei ID. Access to themes, music, the cloud, and most importantly ""Find My Phone"", but NONE of this works in the USA! The Mate SE phone's Huawei software was much better but more outdated which isn't a bad thing. I don't like the direction Huawei is going. Their limited selection of ""themes"" is terrible. The Mate SE was better. Also, I have to say that the Mate SE camera wasn't as picky and worked better. I wish I could return my Mate 20 Lite, but I ordered it on another site and there is a 20% restock fee, so I'd have to fork over $40 plus shipping. The Mate 20 Lite is a decent phone, and if you get the right version of the Mate 20 Lite, you can get LTE service for AT&T. But beware, there are like 6 different variations of this phone and only one of them supports AT&T LTE. Overall I was expected more from a phone that cost double the price, and I really am not seeing a big difference between the Mate SE and the Mate 20 Light. Also, why is the Mate 20 Lite a newer phone but it STILL doesn't have Android Pie? The camera software on the Mate SE was better. If you are looking for a great budget phone, get the Mate SE and shop around as I got mine for $130. But the Mate 20 Lite just doesn't seem like an upgrade to me. The software that it does have is terrible and then there is the lack of software, like for the camera.",5,"HUAWEI"

I use my phone HEAVILY through the day and when I get home I still have about 20% battery life which is outstanding. My LG Stylo 3 would die by noon, I lived with it on charge. I had a Xiaomi MI a2 for less than a month before this but it lagged and froze and had a terrible camera (stylo 3 was much better) so I returned it for this and I could not be happier with my choice (so far, remind you I've only had it about 2 weeks). I highly recommend this phone and seller. Phone came on time as promised in perfect condition. Can't rave enough about this phone! Well worth the $ and I can't believe it isn't more expensive with all that it offers.",2,"HUAWEI"

"1493","B07J4Z9647",2,"true","I really liked this phone. Snappy, decent camera and fantastic battery. But it has a major issue, it has very poor to non existent support for T-Mobile LTE in the US even though the specs and description says it supports LTE bands, 2/4/12. After being in one location like my home or office, it would stop receiving calls and they would be sent straight to voicemail. Once it starts, the only option is turning off 4G or turning airplane mode off and on to get it to be recognized by the network. I was told that it is because the phone does not support VoLTE and would fail when dropping to 3G to receive a call. Now I knew the phone did not support VoLTE, but neither did my last phone and it worked flawlessly. I reset the phone, got a replacement SIM and spent many hours trying to solve this. The worst part is calling worked fine and I did not even know I had an issue until a client tried to get a hold of me and I would not pick up. He ended up contacting someone else for support and I lost the job. He did leave a message, but the message didn’t show up until I reconnected to the network. So, I loss nearly $500 because of it. Overall I am really upset that this did not work. It seems to be a really nice phone, just not for US T-Mobile. Also, when researching it seems this will be an issue with AT&T and any GSM carrier in the US as they all use ether T-Mobile or AT&T towers.",3,"HUAWEI"

"1542","B07J4Z9647",4,"true","I bought an Honor play to use as my primary phone. I instantly fell in love with it. The speed, the operating system, the look, the screen, the ai camera, the battery life. It was by far the biggest jump in upgrade for a phone i've had in 15 years. One drawback, no 4g in the us. It was my first international phone so i wasnt fully knoledgeable about the purchase. I returned it and got this Mate20 lite. Roughly the same price you get a lower spec'd processor, and no ai chip. The ai functions well on this lower speced processor, and i did have the phones side by side for a few days before i sent the play packing. side by side tests, the mate is slower on facial recognition, camera isnt as good (front camera is as good or better though), and it seems they have the exact same display. I ran a benchmark (3d mark) on both phones since there was no info on the kirin 710. I got a dismal 930 Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1. Slin Shot Extreme-Vulkan 1126. Signifigantly less than the honor play (around 2900 points ins slingshot extreme).

I did the usually things to protect the phone by encasing it in a case and installing a temper glass protector on the screen. Eight months later, I dropped the phone accidentally on a carpet and the screen cracked. I have dropped many other phones in the past and some on hard surfaces, but other than dents and chippings, none had cracked. I googled on the web and found that many had complained about the fragility of the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Lite screen which is made with glass. Being a DYI person I am, I ordered a replacement kit and replaced the damage screen. The replacement screen didn't last more than 2 months and it cracked again after I dropped the phone on a hardwood floor, but only from knee high level.

The screen is nice and bright also good resolution and accurate colors. The battery life could be better but isn't all that bad even for a power user.

"1582","B07J4Z9647",4,"true","Speakers are low cheap quality. Optical zoom is terrible - the video turns out blurred. One day after purchase Android patch was applied automatically which limited functions available to user - is it coincidence or intentional. User Interface EMUI which is provided by manufacturer is fine but compared to IOS it scores 6 out of 10. Processor is not from Qualcomm like in more expensive models. You can attribute all this, except smearing OS with ugly patch for which they don't ask owner's permission, to attractive entry price. It is not as nimble and responsive as iPhone but has appealing exterior - an eye candy. Backplate which looks more silverfish than gold and projects refined glassy look. Battery life significantly outperforms IPhone.. Important feature has 3.5mm jack for headphones which is a major plus. Overall a value for the price.

I simply inserted my microcard from my previous phone into this one, turned it off and on, and I was up and running without issues.

"1585","B07J4Z9647",2,"true","It's an ok phone for the cheap price. If you are expecting flagship quality you'll be sorely disappointed. It definitely has some glaring flaws. The cons 1. Blue screen that you cannot soften. No night sight either. 2. Alot of bad background noise during conversations to the point that it hurts the other person's ears. 3. It's difficult to hear the speaker. 4. It runs out of battery very quickly(about 2 hours of continual use or 5-6 hours of little to no useage) 5. The screen cracks easily The pros 1. Good quality photos considering how cheap the phone is. They aren't flagship quality,but they aren't terrible either. For someone that just wants them for memories it works just fine. 2. It's a sleek thin phone that's easy to handle despite it's weight. 3. The price is very reasonable 4. It is a factory unlocked phone just as advertised. For a cheap phone it's not bad at all. I wouldn't purchase it for anyone doing physical labour or exercise especially outdoors since the slightest bump inside a case will cause the screen to crack. And it will keep cracking from different spots Everytime it's bumped until you lose pieces of the screen.",NA,"HUAWEI"
"1586","B07J4Z9647",5,"true","Good phones got cheap and cheap phones became good. This direcly applies to this device. Where this phone really shines is battery life. I've easily got 6 hours of screen on time and had 25% left at end of the day, that included no wifi usage and low signal locations. Phone is very snappy and rarely there are any slowdowns. Good camera, plenty of space, works well with Metro/Tmobile. I highly recommend this phone. Phone comes with transparent case. It's hard to beat this value at less than $250. I would also suggest looking into xiaomi mi a3, it might offer a little bit more for the money since it's just came out. (at time of writing this review)",NA,"HUAWEI"
"1587","B07J4Z9647",5,"true","This is my second Huawei phone. I got this one on amazons next day shipping, slapped in my sim card, and I was good to go. First of all, the battery life is awesome. All day on a charge easily. It sips power like my Corolla sips gas. The screen is amazing. Everything works great. There is a feature where you can swipe left on the home screen and it will bring up articles Google thinks I want to see. That will crash on occasion, but it just reverts to the home screen. People cannot believe how cheaply I got this thing. If I had 700 to spend I would have gotten the One Plus 7. But I got this for 230.00 and I am very happy.",1,"HUAWEI"
"1588","B07J4Z9647",5,"true","Super fast, great display, good audio. Perfect size for me. I'm very happy. I had a Nexus 6 (good but too big), then a LG Stylus (worst phone I've owned), and now this. AFAIC, this thing operates as well or better than a contemporary Samsung Galaxy. I use those devices at work as a mobile software engineer. This Huawei is a great value. I'd be happy if I'd paid two times more, so it's even better at this price. Mine came with screen protector already on it and a case. Pleasantly surprised. On AT&T I just swapped the chip into my new phone and transferred old phone data over my local network in ~45 minutes. Easy peasy. Very good purchase for me.",NA,"HUAWEI"

Battery life is good, speed is good, display is good, the set up is good. The best is the LTE support, It has LTE bands 2, 4, 12 which TMobile deploys. So, network wise is no issue at all. Two minor issues if I am picky, camera auto focus takes few seconds (or always take two and delete the 1st), the phone comes with bundled software like Huawei email and cloud, Can't uninstall them. I was confused at beginning. Then I realized and skipped them. Overall, I am really happy with the phone. I had bad experience with other Xiaomi or Huawei which has none or limited LTE band supports. This one is good enough, at least in my area.",NA,"HUAWEI"

( now that was fast) The quality surpasses my previous huawei 9 mate lite and other then it not showing the usa as a place of use ( that was before I updated it not sure if that's changed since the update) however I use u.s. virgin islands then had no problem setting it up thanks to the 64gb onboard memory no need to have the sim prior to setting it up I even got online before going to att. to get my phone activated. This is my 2nd Huawei and as long as there available I only buy Huawei. I only bought a new phone because the p9 mate lite wouldn't converse with nintendo switch when trying to link to pokemon go, that is not a problem with the Huawei mate p20 lite, it connected the first try without a problem. I thought my old Huawei was fast (easily surpassing Galaxy 9+ for getting online and loading pages). however this p20 seams to be twice as fast as the p9. The metal highly polished gold finish looks like real gold. If you want a phone that's super fast at everything and makes other top name brands look like there standing still get this phone you won't regret it, like i regret getting that overpriced Galaxy 9+ I bought for my wife on her Birthday last year, ( well that's what she wanted).

Memory capacity is awesome as well. Battery life is awesome, the best battery on a phone I've ever had!

"1672","B07J4Z9647",4,"true","I love this phone! It's packed full of features. I could go on and on about what this phone does. The specs are really good, and it does not feel like 6.3 inches because it is really narrow so it still fits in your pocket. The only thing is, the first one I ordered worked great, and then about 2 weeks in got a glitch, so i told amazon about it, not knowing what else to do and they told me to return it. So I ordered another one and paid more because the price went up, but this one is worse. The 1st one, the facial recognition worked like 95%, and everything else was great too. But this one I have now ; the facial rec only works like 87% my Google Assistant has been not working correctly all the time and that's becoming more frequent it seems, my fingerprint won't administer if my fingers are damp or sweaty (which did not happen ever with the last one) my fingerprint scanner won't pull down my menu on occasion, and a few more things. This time I don't know whether to think I got a bad unit or if this phone just stops being great after about 2 weeks. I really don't want to ask for a refund though since I already had one last time I ordered this product. And even if I do, I love the features so I would probably just order it again an d hope everything works right this time",7,"HUAWEI"
"1673","B07J4Z9647",5,"true","I waited 3 months to write this review and all I can say is that I am extremely satisfied with the Mate 20 Lite. For starters the build quality is nice and feels premium, for a 6.3'' phone it fits nicely in a hand. Phone is fast and all the apps and features run smoothly with little to no lag, in addition, it is also very responsive. Camera quality is also great with the addition of the AI support photos are automatically sharpened and cleaned for the best quality possible. The facial camera works great most of the time, I say this because at times in low light it easy recognizes but in a room with the blinds fully opened (or a very bright room) it has trouble recognizing. Its not really a problem as there is also a finger print sensor that so far has been working as intended. One issue I have found is that some calls are automatically transferred to voicemail even though I have call forwarding disabled. I have T-mobile so it may be a frequency issue but it happens rarely, in addition, some messages get delayed as wells. I'm not too bothered by this but it can be an inconvenience at times such as work calls. All in all, I think this is a great phone both for the price and performance you are getting.",7,"HUAWEI"

"1675","B07J4Z9647",5,"true","This is my second Huawei phone I bought. So for all you first timer and a bit skeptical, I can understand your thoughts initially. But let me assure you this phone is excellent!!! I have used Samsung phones, iPhone and Huawei phones. I can tell you it works the same and at times surpasses the others. It doesnt get hot during recharging like the other two. Life of battery is EXCELLENT. Camera resolution, on par as those of the other two cell phone brand. I really cannot find any drawback in this phone. You may need a little time to get adjusted to the operating software, but it is still Android based and it should take no time to get adjusted. And to be quite honest, in terms of internet usage, Huawei surpasses the other two brand. Its more reliable and faster. The best part is, the price is unbeatable!!! In today's age where cell phones are becoming standard commodity, there is no need to spend USD 1K for a cell phone. This Huawei will do the job just fine. Plus more for a few hundred bucks!!! CANT BEAT THIS DEAL!!!",6,"HUAWEI"
"1676","B07J4Z9647",4,"true","I waited a few months prior to writing a review to have a good opinion and assessment. I switched from apple to Android and picked this particular phone based on overall reviews and picture quality reviews. The picture quality reviews are legit, this phone does take great pictures and has various modes and features in which you can use for pictures. However, what I wish I would have known - This phone is all touch screen, and very sensitive. The worst thing is accidentally hitting a bottom touch screen button while typing, which then exits what you are doing and you have to then go back to the screen you were in. I have also accidentally taken many pictures or placed calls when handling the phone - taking it in and out of my pockets, purse ect. The size of the phone is pretty large and I cannot comfortably hold it in one hand (I'm a female with smaller hands). Others who do not have an Android had trouble sending me messages so I could not receive them until I figured out iPhone users must send texts in regular SMS each time they send a text, or they must change their settings to convert all imessages to SMS texts if the phone receiving the message is not an iPhone. Emojis on Android do not look the same as iPhone, and a Google keyboard must be installed so you can even have the emojis. While typing in general, if you are a fast typer the auto correct will constantly change your words without you realizing. So, you have to always change words back to what you want. GIFs on this phone are limited, you dont have access to as many compared to iPhone. Overall, it's a decent phone but I personally think it's annoying to use.",3,"HUAWEI"

When the call is over, it connects back to 4G LTE. This is because VoLTE is not supported with my carrier (T-Mobile US) and it needs to drop to 2G/4G for voice. This is a list of how it is working. WiFi On, phone sleeps, calls go straight to voicemail. No call notification. I will only know I got a call if they leave a VM. (Caller gets 5 seconds of silence, no ringing, then voicemail) WiFi Off, phone sleeps, calls ring correctly. Turn off 4G LTE and only use 3G, phone sleeps, calls ring correctly. BTW, this was not an issue with my last phone. I have spent hours with my carrier without a solution. Swapped SIM cards, they even killed my account and reset it. Nothing has worked.",4,"HUAWEI"

Everything is great in this phone, but 50% of the time incoming calls/texts did not go trough. A trip to T-mobile office didn’t help. They changed access point settings, which was supposed alleviate the problem, but it didn’t. Still missed calls, sms messages. Maybe it was my phone, maybe it’s worth to try. Because at the price point it’s hard to find a phone so nicely done. 03/28/19 Update. After returning the phone I went to search the web for similiar problems with the model(should have done it before), a nd found a forum discussing this very problem: incoming calls go to answering service right away, textx coming hours later... Happens only on T-mobile, and a possible solution is to turn wifi calling feature off. I wish I tried that before returning the phone",3,"HUAWEI"

My one complaint so far is that I have to use the same ding for my emails as my text messages. So when I here the tone, I never know if it was an email or a text. Overall, I'm in love. I never thought I would have anything other than a Samsung. I was in love with my Note 3. And then my Note 4. But for the price, this phone is everything I want and need.

But for the price is definitely a must buy we were weary of buying it because we saw a couple reviews and answers saying it might only take 2g or 3g but it received a 4g signal and everything works smoothly, we are currently using Cricket Wireless as our service provider.

"1906","B07K1M36CM",5,"true","This is the best phone I have ever owned. I upgraded from an iPhone 6s that I had for two years. I wanted a new phone and I was sick and tiered of Apple playing mind games with its overly loyal customers while Chinese companies like Huawei are releasing next level phone technology at reasonable prices. I bothered to go to the apple store and try out every single new iPhone they had testing the camera and how images looked and I was very disappointed at how little apples cameras and screen rez has changed since the 6s for most of their phones. If I wanted a decent apple phone camera I would have to shell out nearly 1k for a phone which I refuse to do. So I did some research online and found the Huawei, which I had never previously heard of, was a darling amongst tech reviewers. Now that I have it in my hands I can see why. On the one hand I like having a phone that most people don't have but I also feel obliged to say if you are still with apple please leave the cult and buy a phone from a company that sees its customers as valuable and intelligent. Apple thinks you are stupid and will charge you for just the aesthetics of a phone that is lacking in features. I paid for fast shipping and it came on schedule. I got the emerald green because the twilight is too showy and corful for me, this is a great classy color with depth. The few areas for improvement on this phone are ones I knew about before buying and that is the face unlock and fingerprint scanner, they lag and are not as smooth and swift as on other devices, this is mostly just annoying when driving but I guess all more reason to stay focused on the road. And another random problem I have is that I haven't been able to use split screen with my knuckles yet, but that may be due to my screen protector.",1,"HUAWEI"

If you like to fiddle and manipulate software to get it to work for you then perhaps you'll enjoy all the fiddling you need to do just to get this set up for daily use.

Final straw was when I realized that this thing was operating on an April 2019 security patch and no matter which hack I tried I as unable to get it to update to something more recent.

"1918","B07K1M36CM",5,"true","I am a mobile app programmer, and have dozens of both Android and iOS devices out of necessity. As I have been doing this for some time (since 2011), I am quite jaded when it comes to smartphones and for the last several years, have not been at all excited about new flagship smartphones that have come out. I am, however, pleasantly surprised and excited enough to write a quick review on this Huawei Mate 20 Pro. First off, I do not work for Huawei or any device manufacturer. Second, I was lucky to get a unit that does not have the screen bleed issue that some users apparently have unfortunately, from the first shipments of the device. I have now used my Mate 20 Pro as my daily driver for a full work week, and actually enjoy picking it up and using it, like when these type of devices first came out. Some things that are notable and what stands out---- (a) The phone is noticeably fast... actually very fast. I know it's got the latest and greatest 8-core Kirin 980 processor, but until you use it for daily activities, you don't realize the difference from other devices. Example: I can scroll through a Facebook or Instagram feed very fast, while every video is *playing back* in each post with no stuttering or glitching. Any button I tap, or app I start instantly loads up, and is addictive to see everything respond so quickly. (b) Something about the screen is very very sharp. I keep mine at the full 3120x1440 WQHD+ resolution, and for some reason, it seems sharper and brighter than other flagship phones I had as my daily driver this year including the LG G7, iPhone X and the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. (c) The 4200 mah battery is incredible. Example: I'll go to sleep with the phone fully charged. I'll use my phone all day as usual, and by the time I go to sleep, it's still at 56% or so battery left. This is with watching Youtube videos, listening to music, emails, Facebook, Instagram, testing my apps and the usual. Also, it has this 'reverse' wireless charging feature, and my friends trip out when I take my iPhone X, and place it on top of the Mate 20 Pro and it starts charging! (d) The in-screen finger print scanner is something else. It has this cool bright blue/white flash for a second when it reads my finger and it logs me in instantly. I've also got the face recognition turned on so I have both, and its novelty is still amusing 6 days in. (e) The build quality is top notch. It feels like I have a very premium device, as it should, having paid $1049 for it. Well worth the money. (f) The ability to clone apps (i.e. have 2 Facebook apps, each logged in with a different account), as well as completely cloning your phone, so there's a completely separate copy (like a dual boot PC) is very cool for a device of this calibre. Very useful when testing environment needs are different than what my daily driver settings are. (g) The 3 cameras main cameras, the 40mp main, 20mp ultra wide angle, and 8mp telephoto work very very well. I have been partial to LG phones for a while because they were the only ones with the wide angle camera, but now that this flagship Huawei has it, I'm sticking with the Huawei now. (h) I have a pair of some wireless bluetooth Sony WM-1000XM3 headphones that I use with it, and the audio is incredible. This of course may just be the headphones themselves, but I got both at the same time. (i) Everything is just incredibly fast on this device, so it makes you want to touch every app, tinker with it, etc. just because everything comes up instantaneously. I realize the U.S. Intelligence agencies warn against Huawei devices because of suspected ties to the Chinese government, but as a random civilian user with nothing really to hide, I have to say this is an excellent device and really shows Chinese hardware makers have upped their game to the top of the global food chain. I highly recommend it for those who don't mind spending money for quality products. p.s. As a final note, I do not use the Huawei ID, nor created an account. I just use only my Google Account with it, so I may not be getting all the frills that come with that, but even without, it blows away all other devices I've had this year by a wide margin.",210,"HUAWEI"

"1934","B07K1M36CM",5,"true","I don't buy a new cell phone very often, but when I do, I do a lot of research ahead of time. Every review, especially those from Europe and Asia, led me to buy this phone. I figured that if the Europeans with their tough privacy and cyber security laws, and the savvy Asian tech shoppers from Singapore and Hong Kong like this phone so much, I was going to give it a try. I figured Huawei overtook Apple to become the second largest smartphone brand in the world for a reason. I have had this phone now for a week. I can say that I am surprised that I am using it over my (new very fast Macbook pro) lap top for the first time. This phone is very fast and has very sharp images. The wifi and LTE reception are super compared to a dozen of other units in my household -- a true pleasure to use. I work in hospitals that require me to log into the hospital computers no matter where I am to review detailed, often urgent and complex cases that often contain large image files. Patient confidentiality is also a big cyber issue. Up to this point, I could never do that with a cell phone nor even on a high resolution IPad. With this phone, with its amazing speed and QHD resolution, I am finally able to give up my laptop. The facial recognition, the thumb print entry features on top of pass codes are reassuring. This phone came with a very nice ""tips"" icon. I have only tried out a few of their amazing artificial intelligence features. They actually worked. I was shock that you can point the camera at any document in any language and get it translated instantly into any other language in the world. The camera images are truly amazing -- very very sharp, telephoto lens...! So far, smoothly running all my google apps, investment apps, audible, Netflix ... -- no complaints at all.",60,"HUAWEI"

The main reason i got it was because of the camera, and im still really impressed with it, the pictures it takes are really great. The other main factor is the battery life, i can easly get 2 days of battery life doing the same things i did with the iPhone X and S9+ ( used to get on those 2 phones around 10 hours of battery life ). The only disadvantage you can get with this phone is the sound on speaker mode if you are a speaker sound guy, better get an iPhone which has a louder sound.

"1949","B07K1M36CM",5,"true","I've had this for about 3 weeks as my main phone. Contrary to ""light leaking"" and glue gate claims, the model I received is fine. So there are no issues to report regarding that. I'm in the US on AT&T. No issues with coverage whatsoever. Ok, onto the pros and cons. Pros: - Battery life: Absolutely the best on any smartphone right now. I easily get around 35 hours (moderate to heavy usage on YouTube, Instagram, FB). I've had the iPhone XS Max, Pixel 3 XL, Samsung S9+, etc and with this phone, I don't feel the need to search for an outlet. - Super fast charging: this is on par with the OnePlus, if not better with 40w charging. 70% in 30mins is factual - I have tried it myself. - Form factor: I have smaller hands but the 6.3"" screen in this frame is a joy to handle. Easier to hold than a Note 9. - Camera: You won't get a perfect shot everytime like the Pixel 2/3 series but the versatility of lenses is unmatched in 2019. The wide, telephoto, and 5x hybrid zoom are fun to play with and sharp. You just need to play with all the modes depending on what you're capturing. There are many modes to choose from. I'd rate this camera just behind the and Pixel 3 but ahead of the iPhone X's. - Gestures: You can maximize screen real estate by using screen gestures similar to the iPhone X's. Love this btw. No need for the usual 3 nav buttons. - IR blaster - Desktop mode mirroring onto your smart tv (similar to Samsung Dex but totally wireless) Cons: - Notifications: they do not always display on the lockscreen (which is odd). Kind of a bummer but not a deal breaker. - Vibration motor: iPhone X is still King in this department. Huawei's is a tad weak. - Carrier availability: not sold in US. Overall: this is a true beast of a phone. It's a shame Americans don't have a chance to experience this powerhouse jam-packed with features. With outstanding battery life and super fast charging, amazing camera, great form factor, gorgeous screen, this is truly worth every penny you pay for.",104,"HUAWEI"

Had to then Google how to factory reset it, which took several attempts because the phone kept stating that the software installation failed and that I needed to see tech support online. Finally got it to factory reset, then complete an actual set-up, and it seems to be working fine now, and not forgetting my PIN. I was literally on the verge of returning this phone because of all the software malfunctions it had within hours of me receiving it. Hopefully I don't ultimately need to. Sidenotes: 1.)

Incredible photos: the quality of the photos is undeniable. 3. Where is my phone?: The Smart Assistance feature allows me to find my phone if I left it somewhere in my house and I cannot find it. I always lose it, so this feature is super useful! 4. Great themes and tones! Also, the Eye Comfort feature is something wonderful. 5. Its curved screen gives a better definition and is truly beautiful. Not so great things: 1. The video quality is good, but there are other phones with better video quality. 2. The audio quality is not the best (it's good, do not misunderstand me, but there are competitors with something better). 3. Does not have the traditional entrance for headphones; so you can only use the ones that the phone brings that connect by USB or use wireless. 4. The face recognition feature (in my opinion) is not so effective. 90% of the times doesn't recognize me. In general, I do not regret my purchase.

This phone lives up to the hype and has exceeded all of my expectations! The camera is amazing, the resolution of the screen is beautiful, and the operating system took a little getting used to but the EMUI skin that Huawei utilises seems to be slightly inspired by iOS. I haven't noticed any of the green screen bleed that some people mention and I also can't attest to the overall security of the phone (alleged Chinese malware and spying).

There's a bunch of maybe apps and they throw in some others like Facebook which is annoying but given the storage isn't an issue. Main problem I found is if you're using Google service the native photo email and messaging app will get in the road where they will still act as defaults so to send a photo you need to go in to photo and send it from there instead of doing in the messages app , pure Android on these would be perfect The fingerprint reader can be hinky but the face recognition is quick although I'm not sure how secure it is . Bluetooth can be problematic but I've switched to a pixel phone and some of the connection problems still exist. Screen protectors can be a problem I've had them fall off when you drop the phone so it pays to have spares. Can't fault the camera but I did miss the dedicated black and white sensor that was on the 10.

It last long due to large battery and charges super fast with it's original charger. The back cameras take amazing pictures with great dynamic range and detail. As well as low light pictures come out good in most conditions that's not near pitch black. Video is good also but i wish it did 4k 60fps, it only does 30fps. Front camera is not great it does skin smoothing too heavily I can't seem to find a way to turn it off. Im not a selfie whore so it doesn't bother me much. For a tall phone it feels good in the hand but one hand typing is out of the question. I don't like the software UI and it came with so much bloatware, luckily i installed the pixel launcher and you can uninstall 90% of useless apps it came with. Mostly my experience has been more than amazing with this phone and would recommend it but it's not easy to get here in the U.S. Also the seller added a US power adapter free of charge, it comes with a Euro charger in the box and i was ready purchase one.

It has everything an average user like me would want in a phone. -Battery Levels are beyond amazing, phone can last for couple days if you keep apps closed in the background and low brightness. -Camera works great in broad day light, use night mode for night, it can't be compared to high end phone cameras but the phones can take very decent pictures. Selfie camera is good too, fixed focus. HDR mode helps bring our colors as well. -The Screen to body ratio is amazing, you can watch 1080P videos and be amazed. -Inbuilt speaker isnt the greatest but you can always invest in a cheap Bluetooth speaker. -I've gotten around 150 MB down on the internet speed test on the WIFI. Which is very close to what I get on computer with Ethernet cable. Overall even though the body is plastic, it still looks like a very premium device.",6,"HUAWEI"

I loved the P8 Lite, which is why I bought another Huawei. Take note of the following :- 1) The Y6 (also known as the ""Y6 Prime"" - same thing, just another name) comes in no less than 4 models - the MRD-LX1, MRD-LX1F, MRD-LXN, and the MRD-LX3 (this model). Only the LX1F and the LX3 have the fingerprint sensor. As far as I can determine, the LX1F and the LX3 are identical (can someone correct me if I am wrong ?), but only differ in how they are bundled - my LX3 included a screen protector. I have seen the LX1 advertised on several sites (not Amazon !!) with the photograph showing the fingerprint sensor which the LX1 does NOT have, so be cautioned ! 2) I was careful to check that this Huawei model comes with all the Google Apps and Android; this has changed for Huawei's new models, starting with the Pro Mate 30, which has no Android or Google. I would be extremely reluctant to buy a phone with no Android or Google !! 3) Do not confuse the Y6/Y6 Prime with the ""Y6 Pro"" - these are different phones. This is a lovely phone at a good price !

The LG phone it replaced spent a lot of time on it's charger. I have yet to run this phone down below 30% battery - even when using it to watch movies on long flights and not bothering to plug it in overnight on mosts nights. It charges so quickly it is difficult to believe. That is it's absolutely best feature. Advanced android OS is the other - the ability to do things like back up to a NAS i have on my home network automatically, etc. Works extremely well as a phone - much louder and clearer than other phones I have used.

"2034","B07Q2WPMNB",5,"true","Despite the ongoing trade war issues surrounding Huawei, this is still the absolute BEST smart phone camera on the market period. There's no competition. If price is not a factor get this phone. That said. it is pricey (on par with Pixel3) but it blows the pixel 3 out of the water. More powerful specs, better camera and overall much more premium feeling when you hold it in your hand. Some people consider EMUI a down side but honestly not me. I quite enjoy the gesture based navigation and I haven't had any real problems so far. To be noted this particular product listing did NOT come with a free clear plastic case like you might see in various unboxing videos. The super charger that comes with it is EU plug (it came with a super cheap adapter to convert to US but it's cheap and not a very stable connection so i recommend getting a better adapter.) I recommend registering for a huawei ID ahead of time on a computer because I ran into issues doing it on the device. If you are getting this to use on Google Fi make sure you order a free sim card from google prior to getting the phone. Despite being advertised as ""Sim-Free"" this is not the same as Google Fi ""Sim-free setup"". all it means in this case is they don't include a sim because it's unlocked for all carriers, you still need to put a sim in sim slot 1 for service it's not eSim capable",67,"HUAWEI"

My hobby is photography, and I thought the iPhone Xs camera was amazing, but the P30 blows that camera out of the water in so many ways. The 10x digital zoom is unbelievable sharp, and the 5x optical zoom is unparalleled. The phone has a beautiful feel in the hand, even with a case. I think part of that is the narrow width/longer length. Even though the screen specs are nowhere near those of the Galaxy10, I find it crisp and bright. EMUI might be antiquated, but I find it perfectly functional. Although it is expensive, even the basic version is 8GB RAM and 128GB memory is a huge leap from my Xs, for less money. My only complaint so far is the facial recognition - it barely works. Sometimes, even in perfect light and no hat or sunglasses, it doesn't work. But I sure like having a unique camera.

"2072","B07Q2X19LG",5,"false","So I've been in the market for a new phone since I have a Samsung s7 and it's getting slower. I have been looking at the flagship phones - Huawei p30 pro, p30, Samsung s10E, S10, S10+ and even the Samsung s9+, I've looked at the side by sides and the Huawei wins. Here's why - 1. Huawei has the bigger battery, (battery run tests show in order of phones dying after same usage: 6. Samsung 10e, 5. Samsung S10, 4. Samsung S9+ 3. Huawei p30. 2. Huawei p30 Pro. 1. Samsung S10+. This was a bit of a shocker because I thought Huawei pro has a bigger battery than the 10+, but the test showed better performance by the Samsung. 2. Price - The Huawei p30 pro and the Samsung 10+ are are both out of my price range. The only major difference between the p30 Pro and the P30 is the P30 pro has wireless charging (which replaces a headphone jack), a bigger camera sensor, superior telephoto lens, bigger battery, and better display. For me - I don't personally like huge phones that don't fit in my pocket, I also don't like the 300 dollar price difference, I furthermore don't care about wireless charging, AND I really want a headphone jack. So for me - the P30, the S10 and the S10e made more sense to buy. 3. Now when it comes to photos, the results are very mixed. For the price, the Samsung s9+ is the best camera/price combo out of all of these, the difference between the S9+ and the S10 are very minimal to me. The colors look more true on the S9 than the S10s for some reason. There's a youtube video comparing these cameras in low-light conditions and even I was shocked that I (along with others who saw the video) picked the S9+ over the S10s. (But again, i dont like bulky phones, so s9+ is out) HOWEVER, the Huawei p30 and p30 pro low-light camera is INDUSTRY LEADING, better than the S10, better than the Pixel 3 (Although Pixel 3 has more true-to-life colors), and Apple (is not even worth a mention here tbh, it's so sad how far they have fallen behind, and how dumb their followers truly are - sorry Apple fans). So because of price, I narrowed it down to the Samsung 10e and the Huawei p30. The Huawei p30 is cheaper that the 10e, which really makes it a no brainer for me. (Right now, the S10E with student discount is $634 (with tax) on Samsung website) and P30 is 599 here and other websites (do your research) with no tax. The p30 has better battery, faster charging, better looks, and superior low-light performance than the S10E - So it's a no brainer I am opting the buy the P30. Added comment 1 wk post-purchase: 1. The Huawei product is not a product of the Chinese government, that's a rumor started in the USA, and only in the USA. I believe it's used to protect Apple's share in the market. US could potentially be Huawei's biggest market, but trade war stuff and politics prevents the US government from allowing Huawei phones to be carried by major carriers. Europe, Canada, Latin America and Asia all have Huawei phones, zero countries have discovered any sort of spying hardware or software. The company itself will overtake Samsung or so as the 2nd largest phone company in the world. I did my research thoroughly and stand firm on the results. Any comments to the contrary is either under-researched or not researched. But as a precaution - Huawei ID does ask for access to your information (same as Samsung, same as Apple ID) I opted out of joining the Huawei ID and have no problems - by the way you can't do this on an Apple. 2. Low light amazingness only happens when you take pictures in 40 mp, at 10 mp, the performance is similar to my Samsung s7 edge. Yes, the low light performance is amazing. As expected, daylight pictures are a little cooler than the Samsung photos I've taken. 3. I don't like how all the apps are on your home screen, so I put them all in folders on a third home screen and never scroll there. 4. This phone doesn't have wireless charging, so also by default - no reverse wireless charging. The p30 Pro has that capability. 5. Holy crap this phone is fast - no Google maps load time, faster load times on games than Samsung s10s, when you're on Google maps and you take a wrong turn, the phone immediately recalculates route and gives you new directions, this is especially important when you're in a rush and are looking up directions somewhere, my old Samsung s7 drove me nuts with the load times, and I've missed secondary turns from direction reloading. I got lost in an Uber going to the airport before due to this issue, Uber driver had to pull off to the shoulder for my map to load because her map wasn't showing directions properly. I am relieved this will never happen again. 6. Battery life performance was great as expected - I'm a heavy user and get to 39% at the end of the night. This is super important because when you go out, you have the capacity to take a bunch of pictures, even after all day (heavy) use. This would never happen on an Apple or Samsung phone of equivalent size. 7. P30 uses new technology for your ear, it's not a speaker. It's some sort of ultrasonic vibration. I've heard reviews of it not working as well as the speakers but I found this unfounded, I've noticed no difference in sound quality of calls. However, I did notice differences when the other person put me on speaker. Sometimes they sound really muffled. This problem only existed when i called friends in california (2x this happened with 2 different people) 8. The operating system took zero time for me to learn, some things this phone does better than Apple, some it doesn't. Apple IOS is still Imo, most intuitive. I've had zero issues with app compatibility since p30 runs android. I ran into one problem with Whatsapp and thought it was a compatibility issue, turns out it was a permission I didn't give the app. Problem solved in no time. I will continue to update this review over time. 3 weeks post purchase - the p30 has a problem with the fingerprint sensor going on and off every 10 seconds. This has been a wide ranging problem as seen on the Huawei forums. The US officially banned Huawei (along with Australia, Japan and Taiwan) but the list of countries that don't ban Huawei (because of the potential 5g rollout) includes: most of Europe since Vodafone publically defends Huawei, India, Vietnam, most of South America, Russia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Indonesia. As of 6/27/19 - the fingerprint issue has been fixed, but Google no longer will support Huawei devices. I am not 100% clear how this will affect the phone but the plus side is this trade war might be over soon, once that's all done this phone is a steal. I did a comparison with the Pixel 3 night time, and had minimal difference, my phone did pick up some colors better, definitely better exposure, but completely missed the light purple colors for some reason at night (it comes out as blue) . If that's your favorite color for some reason, you might not want to pick this over the pixel 3. Update 10/1/19 - Trade war still happening, nothing has happened to Google Play store, or any andriod feature. Since Google announced they won't be supporting Huawei, Huawei has declared to build their own operating system, so that should be interesting. This phone battery never dies, not once has this phone ever died because of battery. I've timed it so I charge my phone at work every day or so. When I take this phone out of the little case, the aurura blue is still gorgeous. People think it's the Apple 11 lmao. The 40 megapixel makes drop dead gorgeous 8 x 10 photos which Wal Mart Photo develops nicely. (I've done my research on this, don't go to CVS, Walgreens, etc their photo machines and print quality are trash). No issues with not registering Huawei ID. Zero compatibility issues with apps. This is probably my last update until major changes happen with the trade war or Huawei rolls out with a new operating system. Thanks for the likes!",512,"HUAWEI"

"2087","B07Q2X19LG",5,"false","I have been using iPhone for more than 8 years, from iPhone3GS to iPhone 4S, IPhone 6, and iphoneX. iPhone was the best smart phone in the world, until iPhoneX, which is dispointing. There are a few things I decided to leave iPhoneX: 1. iPhoneX is way too thick than expexted , especially when you use a case. 2. And it's too heavy, I don't understand why apple makes such a heavy thing, compaing iPhone6 I was using. 3. The face id is horrible. I ware a glass at daytime but not in bed, and I turn off lights when using phone. Face id fails 9 out 10 to unlock. I have decided to use P30 instead of my iPhoneX two weeks ago, and feel good till now. The P30 Crystall (light blue) one is really beautiful, and amazing, there are a few reasons why I'm using it instead of iPhoneX: 1. It's supper thin!!!! 2. It's supper light weighted!!! 3. Supper beautiful, my goodness! The back glass is gorgeous! 4. It has a narrow and long screen comparing to iPhoneX, better look and feel then iPhoneX. 5. I had concern about my privacy, but I ended up find out that I don't have to because I mostly use Google service, and all my data in Huawei account is stored in Ireland, it is protected by Ireland's law instead of Chinese law. 6. AWESOME camera! Comparing with iPhoneX, it has better pictures in dark, and similar quality under sunlight outside. I don't have an iPhoneXS or XR, so no comments on that.",13,"HUAWEI"

But the latest version iPhone are too expensive and not much new features compare to other brands. Just bought newly release the P30. First time user of P30. It features 4 Leica cameras. That's the main reason to buy this model. It look like a SLR camera built in a phone. Great photography features. The battery life is also a lot better compare to iPhone. OLED screen is the latest technology. I don't really care about Most of other features . To me, advanced cameras, long battery life and OLED are the must have. $599 price is also very reasonable.

I've only heard about them they do not sell this phone or similar models anywhere around Albany New York. I have heard great things about this phone and the Google pixel 3 XL if your looking for quality but at a value price. I personally own a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus and with the newest update now has a camera night mode. I'm very happy with it, you can zoom up around 8x-10x using a smaller screen ratio, It looks pretty good for a smartphone. I've tried the new night mode taking a picture of my car in the dark and I do notice a difference it's brighter and more colorful then on auto. The S10 Plus is a bit expensive but I would never go with the less expensive S10 models to save a few bucks. This phone is definitely worth the extra money. But It is hard for me to believe that for any phone no matter the company that a smartphone camera at 50x looks clear. Any company can claim you can zoom in 100x which will probably happen in the future, but does it mean it will actually come out sharp and clear?",1,"HUAWEI"

"2100","B07Q2X19LG",5,"true","I purchased this phone late last month, and to date I find it to be a really fantastic phone. Still in the exploration state but to date, I can say the following: Setup was pretty straightforward, transfer of my data from another phone was made easy using 'Phone Clone'. There are other features provided for transferring data from other types of phones as well. Google assistant is a welcome perk for me, that definitely works and makes getting acquainted with my phone easier. I chose the fast charger as a part of my purchase with the phone and it definitely charges up the phone faster than usual, and the phone keeps charge longer than the norm, even with the Bluetooth on and the transfer of data. The camera takes fantastic pictures that shows an explosion of colors that makes an amateur photographer looks and feel like a pro. The camera and video features available on the Huawei P30 make taking pictures and videos a dream. I have to constantly take my phone from my son because he keeps using it to take pics and videos even though he has his own phone. Playing music or doing recordings is great with the added features to make you play music like you are in a club or throwing a party. Oh, the option to have the lyrics show on the home screen while the song is playing is simply dope... Using word, excel, pdf is made simply and easy. Updates are done in the background while using other features of the phone. The 'split screen' option is a bonus to booth.",2,"HUAWEI"

It's also got two full days of battery life, best phone i've ever had in terms of battery life.
