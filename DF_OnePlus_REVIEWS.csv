"6","B07DCB61LG",3,"true","This is a solid phone no doubt about it however for how expensive it is it's quite flawed as in the audio recording is horrid and picture quality is alright and it's got a few problems here and there I expected a little more from this phone. I've had it for a few months now so had to give it a honest trial before writing the review",NA,"OnePlus"
"7","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","This phone is pretty good. I'm still adjusting to the specs and all, but as a whole I do like the phone, and I'm glad someone recommended to look into this phone, since I really wasn't sure what to look for, but I definitely needed a phone that provided more RAM because I design and usually take photos with the phone.",NA,"OnePlus"
"8","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","Almost perfect phone. Great performance. Solid build. The best camera I've had yet. Easy to root and customize.

"10","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","It's perfect. I don't think anyone needs something more, if they are going for the features , not the name. I love this phone , have been using it for several months , the battery is as good as it was in the beginning. It holds charge for one full day, and I use it a lot. It gets fully charged in an hour. I haven't used my power bank with this phone ever.",1,"OnePlus"

"22","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","Honestly, I couldn't be happier with this device. It checks all the boxes for an excellent phone, at a very reasonable price. The Snapdragon 845 is still a beast and the screen is just fantastic. Oxygen OS is THE best Android skin, HANDS DOWN. I actually prefer it to the stock Android found on pixel devices. The camera is very good. Fingerprint scanner is also very accurate. Really zero complaints from me. Best phone I've ever owned!",3,"OnePlus"
"23","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","There is nothing I dislike about this phone. Incredibly snappy. Beautiful bright screen. Plus, check out my about page: they sent me 8g + 128g despite buying just the 6+64. Stop debating; buy this now!",2,"OnePlus"

"30","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","The phone is quick and easy to use and the GPU on the phone is also great. NFC feature Works flawlessly. A large amount of RAM is very helpful to be able to use this phone for years to come. Using apps like Google Translate with their image recognition system to translate words it's fast compared to using a low-budget phone. GPS on the phone is very accurate and Powerful. I have a house with a metal roof and the signal comes in very strong. I use the step counter on this phone that's right there is a step counter on this phone. I think its better than the accelerometer on the phone itself that uses inaccurate data. The step counter gives accurate step counting data show how many miles you walked. The audio quality through the headphone jack and Bluetooth is very good I use it to connect to my car. Overall this is a great phone for my needs.",2,"OnePlus"
"31","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","Well, my previous phone was an Orbic plus, n within a few months, that $#!t's battery died within hours. At least this one, I can go a whole day without needing to recharge-- if I don't play Pokemon Go too much; pretty much the reason I got this one. On that note: load times are much faster, GPS is a lot more accurate, usb-c means rapid charge/synch. I don't know when I'll next be able to really make use of the international sim card features, but certainly will use eventually, but do wish I thought ahead n got the version with a micro SD slot instead: tbh by the time I'll next need/be able to use international sim cards, I'm sure I'll have worn down the battery capacity",1,"OnePlus"

"40","B07DCB61LG",5,"false","Best bang for the buck. If you prefer the android platform you really cannot go wrong with this phone. It is the best bang for the buck. Does just about everything that the more expensive phones do. Plus it is lightning quick. Probably the fastest smoothest phone I have ever used.",2,"OnePlus"
"41","B07DCB61LG",2,"false","No aftermarket support for repairs. To repair the screen the phone must be sent in. I just spend $126 to repair a broken screen. The phone must be sent into a repair center for this service, it's very inconvenient. I also initially received a faulty phone when I first bought it.",NA,"OnePlus"
"42","B07DCB61LG",3,"true","All, this ad is bit misleading. I originally gave them 1 star but I now realize OnePlus is most of the blame here. OnePlus products are VERY confusing. For those of you who don't know, there are two versions of this phone. This phone (A6000) is the Asian (Chinese) version. The other version (A6003) is known as the US/EU version. To make things more confusing, the A6003 is often referred to as the ""International version"" (but there's no clear description one way or another from OnePlus, etc.). Either way, do your homework before buying this A6000 especially if you live in the US. Be familiar with the differences between these two. For example, TMobile will with be severely crippled in the US with the A6000 . But the A6000 is cheaper so it will be a better deal in other places, etc. OnePlus 6 is great phone by the way. Thumbs way up…",15,"OnePlus"
"43","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","My wife like it better than her old Samsung S6. I will buy again",1,"OnePlus"
"44","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","Good display, battery life, fast. So far (a few weeks) everything working perfectly.",1,"OnePlus"
"45","B07DCB61LG",4,"true","With the smartphone market now saturated with over-priced or under-valued phones, the Oneplus 6 is just the answer to all demands I have with a smartphone. I consider myself quite savvy with electronics, and I must say, the OnePlus 6 is quite a sight to behold! The snapdragon 845 is extremely powerful (albeit it does get slightly hot when performing demanding tasks, to be expected from such a powerful chip) and should deliver quality performance for years to come. I do not typically purchase a new phone unless its free with an upgrade, but every passing day signifies the completion of a new milestone in technology, thus resulting in the need for better hardware. I really REALLY love that they kept the headphone jack and will not be buying the oneplus 6t or any model hereafter that does not include one. The battery I will admit, is lacking after a day of power usage, however with dash charging I have not found carrying my charger and charging once or twice a day to be inconvenient at all. Oxygen OS is a blessing from the Android Gods, and I feel it necessary to include that one of the strongest aspects of this device is the skin OnePlus has integrated over stock Android. This is not quite the nexus line in terms of open android (custom roms are extremely hit or miss, which I find to be annoying, but I can live with it for now) however time may prove it to be even better. I say I find the lack of custom ROMs and slow development to be annoying, but this may just be old habits stemming from associating proprietary skins with useless and wasteful bloatware/features that have no practicality whatsoever, something that Oxygen OS absolutely lacks. Every feature they include is useful, and the 2 applications I could consider ""bloatware"" are easily removed even without a Terminal Emulator. Needless to say I intend to run this thing for 2, maybe 3 years, and based on my initial impressions, I have no doubt that it will stand strong against the test of time. Phenomenal Now for cons, this phone does not have many, but the most stand-out issue is the lack of proprietary heat dissipation. There is no heat pipe or thermal solution whatsoever in this device. This is slightly mitigated by the all-glass design (which in itself is NOT a con, check with speedtest) which allows the heat to be quickly absorbed and dissipated throughout the body. however this does irk me as heat will be the death of this phone. All things considered, given OnePlus' reputation for outstanding engineering and rigorous manufacturing/approval process, I have faith that the engineers have already investigated this and trust that their decision to not include such things is indeed for reasons other than cost cutting. It is something to note, however, and I take off one star entirely for this reason and this reason alone. Other than that, this device is almost flawless. Note: Some people may consider the 2280x1080 display as being a con, however 1440p on a screen this small only enhances visuals so well and demands much more of the core components inside causing even more heat and worse battery life. For people that list this as a con, scroll to about phone, tap ""Build Number"" until you unlock developer options, and then search through developer options until you see ""Force 4x MSAA"" and enable this feature. Though it won't be the physical pixel density associated with 1440p, this should prove satisfactory to those who believe the display to be limited by its resolution. In my opinion however, the 1080p display is more than enough and I believe most people would agree that 1440p might be a little overrated for a 6.3"" display Note: Some people may also complain about the speaker being low output/mono/tinny at high volumes and while this is a valid complaint please do remember it has a headphone jack and may be the last time we get to see one. I mitigate the subpar speaker based on the fact that I can plug it into any speaker I want. This does not EXCUSE OnePlus for incorporating such a pathetic audio solution, they simply ""dodged a bullet"" with that particular criticism as the industry is generally omitting the headphone port altogether",58,"OnePlus"
"46","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","I was looking for a phone that could replace my beloved but aging LG V20. It had to, at least, have the following features: - Worldwide LTE coverage - Dual SIM tray and management - 3.5 audio jack - flagship internals (SoC, screen, etc..) - Modern/tall screen format with at least 18:9- ratio - Pure or almost pure Android experience - Under $500 pricetag I waited for OnePlus to release the 6T but, alas, they decided to remove the 3.5mm jack. So the choice then was obvious for me: I was going to buy the OnePlus 6. This is hands down the best phone you can get today for under $500 and these are a few of the reasons why: It is fast: All apps load instantly, no matter how many there are aponed or in memory It is gorgeous: even though it is a standard glass sandwich with aluminum on the side design, it manages to stand out, even in front of much expensive phones like S9 or Iphone Battery life is fantastic: I leave home at around 9am with a 100% charge and come back after a day of heavy usage (news, social media, youtube, camera, combination of data and wifi usage) at around 8pm with around 20% to 30% of charge left. And with the DASH charger, you get back to 50% in less than 20m from that point. 0%-50% in 30m The software experience is amazing: Oxygen OS is a ""breeze of fresh air"" in the Android world. No bloatware, no intrusive apps. No duplicate apps... Need a mail app? Gmail. Need a browser? Chrome... Actually, I have not seen a more seamingless integration between HW and SW in the Android world than the one these guys pulled. I personally believe that not even Samsung gets it this right. Oh, and it updated to Android 9.0 Pie off the bat, so security and SW updates on schedule? Also check! And, did I mention it is fast? I mean... seriously fast. All transitions between apps are smooth, animations are smooth, apps execute flawlessly with no hicup, including heavy duty ones like graphic intensive games. No matter what you throw at it, the OP6 will manage it like it is no big deal. When anyone asks me ""Hey Fran, I want to upgrade/change my actual phone, what do you recommend?"" I always say OnePlus. In 2018, I was between OP 6 and OP 6T, which is also fine, but the lack of 3.5mm jack is a deal breaker for me. Also, it is $150 more expensive. So, if you're in the market for a new phone, OP6 is my recommendation. I assure you, it is going to be the smartest choice you'll make and will keep you very happy for very long time. One thing though... the A6000 model is the one for the Chinese and other Asian markets. It lacks LTE bands 30, 32 and 71, used right now by T-Mobile. In the US, I'd recommend buying the A6003 version. For the rest, the A6000 is perfectly fine.",21,"OnePlus"
"47","B07DCB61LG",5,"true","I love my phone! I paid less for my phone than all of my friends, and I have more features than them. Face and fingerprint unlock. Pop out windows like with directions and videos. My phone is faster than all of my friends and I have no complaints. People claim now China is spying on me or whatever, but we all use social media, let Alexa listen to us in every house, and gave Russia our info apparently when we aged our photos.

"70","B07K76LBLZ",4,"true","The description says that it is a factory unlocked phone while in reality it is an unlocked TMobile device. The phone is a model A6013 and can be used on the Verizon network with a little tweaking. I am currently on tracphone plan using a Verizon SIM card. When I first tried to send a text or connect to the network it wouldn't work. I did a little research on line and found that the device has to be set to use Vo-LTE. This can be easily enabled by dialing *#*#4636#*#* selecting ""phone information"" and changing the preferred network type to ""LTE/UMTS auto (PRL)"". Once I did that everything started working normally. The phone came in a white box and was wrapped in buble wrap. It was in fair condition for being a used phone. It had 2 unnoticeable scratches and a small pit that is barely noticeable when the screen is off. The back has some small pitting around the edges of the lense like it had been in a case. Overall I am happy with the phone in general. It kinda ticks me that it is a TMobile unlocked phone and shows the pink splash screen at startup but not enough to send it back. Another thing to note is that the back of the phone is incredibly slippery and easily dropped. Other than that I am happy with the phone. Possibly in the future I will reflash the software to the factory unlocked so that I can debrand the phone.",1,"OnePlus"

Not a big deal so far here in Michigan or Ohio, but some areas may use different frequencies causing you to lose service but I'm not overly concerned personally. The difference between the A6013 and the A6010 is like 2 or 3 frequencies, I can't remember just Google it of you feel it will be a problem. That's the only reason why I gave the phone 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the mislabeling/false advertising. The battery is incredible often lasting 2 days or more if you don't use it all day.

Headphones via USB-C or Bluetooth only, since no audio jack. My phone auto-pairs flawlessly to 7 different remembered BT devices in course of a single week.

I was SO nervous that that was going to happen again. I can affirmatively say, after 4 weeks my fears were assuaged. After 6 months, I’ve found MINOR flaws, but I’m still very happy with my purchase. First, the pros: Snappy, sharp camera (they did “best camera” reviews where it was in competition with the latest iPhone, Galaxy and Pixel phones, and it held its own!) It has very few instances where it shows any sign of hiccupping or slowing down. The “teardrop” camera hole is wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. I mostly use my phone for reading (articles, emails, etc), and the screen is SO tall it’s a godsend. ""Warp Charge"", as they call it. The speed at which it charges the battery is awesome. At 20W charging speed, it beats out the Galaxy S10 (15W), the Pixel 3 (18W), and the iPhone XS (highest speed *probably* 18W, hard to tell). I bought a spare of OnePlus's proprietary chargers to keep at work. Kind of annoying that they're not on a common standard for fast chargers (you have to buy both their brand charger and their brand cable), but who is these days? It doesn’t have any of the nonsense they put in more expensive phones, and the cost-savings brought it down to $579, direct from OnePlus. Now for the flaws: The main thing is the fingerprint reader. It’s fast most of the time. But I feel like I have to push my thumb down extra hard, and it sometimes fails after multiple attempts, especially if there’s grease on my finger or the screen. Still on par with any fingerprint reader I’ve used in the past, and it’s such a minor inconvenience that I’m not mad. I hear that the new OnePlus 7 Pro has a better one, though. Another thing is the vibrator; it’s so weak I don’t feel notifications if it’s in my pocket, and I often don’t hear it. Again, minor inconvenience. Overall, the many pluses (buh-dum, chh) outweigh the few cons. I’m very happy with my purchase. ********************* EDIT 9/4/19: I recently discovered that this phone doesn't have Wifi calling. I had to take off a star because that's a pretty standard feature nowadays, and there are situations where I need it.",1,"OnePlus"

"124","B07K76LBLZ",5,"false","I never thought I could get out of the Apple ecosystem. I'd been an avid iPhone user since the 3GS. The OnePlus 5T first caught my interest, however my ties to the Verizon network prevented me from exploring further. In comes the 6T - Verizon compatible. I watched multiple reviews on YouTube about the 6T and assumed there had to be some sort of catch. Was I wrong. The 6T is one of the most amazing devices I've ever used in my life. Design: Just gorgeous - the curve of the camera bump is more of a design accent than a notch. The phone has a huge 6.41 in screen, but is still easily managed with one hand. The colors are amazing - Mirror Black, Midnight Black, and Thunder Purple(wish I waited for this color!!!!) The 6T feels like it was meant to fit in my hand. (The first party OnePlus cases accent the amazing design and make it even more comfortable.) When you hold the phone, you will know exactly what I mean! Battery: Lasts more than a day with heavy use. I can get almost 6 hrs of screen on time even after watching YouTube, gaming, and general web/app usage. Even better, the included dash charger fills the battery extremely quickly. No wireless charging, but I don't even miss it. Camera: Solid - 4K 60FPS video looks great. Other phones in this price range can't even touch the quality of the camera for pictures. Night shot is solid, looking forward to Future tweeks to prevent the blown out appearance when some light is present. Sound: Probably the only change I would make. The since downward firing speaker is easy to block. The quality is great - would love to see the dual speaker in the next OnePlus phone. If you are in the market for a new phone and can't decide which one to pick up....you're obviously not aware of the OnePlus 6T. I will be recommending this phone to everyone. OnePlus, thank you for creating a product that pulled me away from the clutches of Apple",107,"OnePlus"
"125","B07K76LBLZ",1,"true","The phone that is being describe is not what’s being sold. I purchased my device Feb 22, 2019 and received it the next day. When it arrived it was out of its plastic wrapping and the phone box was damaged. This didn’t really bother me because I was excited about the phone. I continued to set the phone up and unpack everything and noticed everything was in Chinese. This didn’t really bother me either because despite me getting a different model from what is being described and advertised from the seller, the phone itself is AMAZING. The OnePlus 6T is worth buying if you’re looking for a low budget high end phone and I did extensive research before buying to make sure I got the correct model seeing as it distributed from a Chinese manufacturer. The model that is being described is the A6013 but my model I got was the A6010. The 13 is the global model and the 10 is the China/India model. I decided to try and see if I could live with the model I got and my LTE data doesn’t work in most areas.

The charging brick included is tiny and overheats when I charge it. The phone shuts down multiple times and the phone feels hot to the touch when I charge it using this small included charger. I almost return the phone due to the overheating/rebooting while charging. Good thing is I have some full-size charging brick laying around so I switched to the full-size charging brick and the problem resolves itself. (Note to Seller): if you include an after market charging brick with your phone, use the full-size one. Otherwise the small charging brick you included will overheat while it's being charged as the small charger will not handle the voltage.

The update made a world of difference. I have been using my One Plus 7 going on 5 days now. Love it.

In display finger print scanner is fine with right fingers but can't recognize my left hand fingers 9/10 times. I love that it's up front! The pop up front camera is also awesome as it frees up the front screen not to have a stupid notch and helps protect your privacy. It made me aware that my web browser was taking pictures of me of whether I was looking at an ad. I quickly revoked that permission of the app to stop it popping up the front camera and tracking me. Creepy. The rear camera is amazing with wide angle shots and optical zoom. It also performs awesome low light night shots. I read they're adding even more improvements. This brand knows people want awesome photos and is delivering. This unit I received though had two minor defects in the screen two air bubbles about 2 and 4 mm in size in the lower right hand corner. I figure incomplete gluing of glass to digitizer because of the curved screen could be difficult to get right. The battery also is listed as 4000 mAh but right away my battery app has it at 3720 mAh.

"186","B07RCXCPV5",5,"true","I received my OnePlus 7 Pro from this seller within days of ordering. The phone arrived well packaged and in excellent condition. Transferring my data from my old Samsung S8 was surprisingly easy using OnePlus Switch and took less than 15 minutes. I was surprised that not only were my data and applications transferred, my wallpaper and home screen layouts were also preserved perfectly making the move to the new handset a snap. The performance of this phone is simply phenomenal. I opted for the 256 GB + 8 GB RAM option. With an uncommon screen refresh rate of 90 Hz vs the typical 65 Hz, scrolling through applications and switching between them is fast and buttery smooth. The in-screen fingerprint scanner is very fast and rarely misses on the first try. The edge to edge screen is huge and very emersive; being a class leading Samsung AMOLED screen colors are rich and vibrant. Using the pop-up selfie camera is both clever and fast. The camera quickly emerges from it's cubby hole and quickly returns. The phone can instantly detect when it's in free fall and will quickly and automatically retract the camera to avoid damage. A lot of reviewers lamented this phone's lack of official water resistance rating. The phone is definitely water proof. I have had it exposed to pouring rain and placed it on wet surfaces without any issues. Bottom line is this.

"205","B07RCXCPV5",1,"false","I'm someone that hates paying for the name. I saw the specs for the new oneplus 7 pro and was instantly impressed. However, after 5 months of very minor use - internet, texting, calling, and email (no social media or games really at all) - the software on the phone broke/malfunctioned. First, it stopped receiving texts. After a few hours with my carrier (Verizon), we determined it was a phone software issue. Why three hours? Well because it's not a name brand, every single person that helped me (4 upon initial activation, and 5 after this most recent issue) had never heard of OnePlus and had no information about it at Verizon. (-1 for the little guy). Second, I called OnePlus customer support line - out of service. I probably caught it in between website updates or something but I've never seen that before. So I started a live chat. Their responses took MINIMUM 5 minutes after each message, sometimes over 10 minutes (no exaggeration, see picture). First person I spoke to, tells me ""please don't worry,"" when she gives me instructions to do a system reset. I asked if this would erase my phone and she said again ""no, please do not worry."" I do the reset, in which it proceeds to erase the entire phone and goes to system setup. Here it gets stuck at the Google Assistant setup part that you cannot skip or move forward on in anyway (see picture). Then they connect me to another person that asks me to reset it again. They say - ""have you backed up your data?"" I said, no - I was told I didn't have to, so I didn't and now COULDN'T...Still no luck after 2 more resets. Now they want me to send in the phone for 15 days (including shipping) for repairs. Never once did they apologize for creating this larger problem or anything. Meanwhile - all of this chat and repetition takes 2.5 hours...they took forever to respond to you. They said they are on multiple chats at once (-2 for the little guy). Please, just spend the extra $100 and get a galaxy. Or get an LG that is the same price. Tons of other larger, known brands that you can get. Don't be fooled by the specs of the OnePlus. it works just like any other phone, except the fidelity and dependability of the brand/make just aren't there. DO NOT PURCHASE, please don't make the same mistake as me.",2,"OnePlus"
"206","B07RCXCPV5",5,"false","[THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH VERIZON STRAIGHT TALK, SEE BOTTOM OF REVIEW] First off, for the cost savings - buy this directly from the OnePlus site. It's the better route to go with. All of the other reviews have probably touched on most of the phones features pretty in-depth. So let me condense mine. WHAT I LIKE: * Beautiful no-notch OLED display (90hz) * Almond Color looks even better in real life than it does in promos * The OS has been my favorite skin of android I've used and I prefer it over stock. * Features like a side switch for volume mode, screen off flashlight toggle, and camera via double tapping power are top notch. * The speed and performance of the phone WHAT I DON'T LIKE (as much) * Camera is good, but I'm not sure if it's better than the S9+ that I used to own. * Fingerprint scanner is really cool, but I would have much preferred it on the back of the phone. It doesn't always read the most consistently * Phone is quite large, feels bulky but the trade off is that gorgeous screen. * Speakers are kinda meh, but most phones feel that way So - to tell you my story with phones in the last few years, I was stuck in the Samsung ecosystem for a long time and most of my phones were crappy, right up until I bought an S7, and then later upgraded to an S9+ - which this phone somewhat reminds me of in terms of size and screen. I got tired of Samsung's limitations and OS and eventually, I downgraded to an Essential Ph-1 with the intent to Root and install a custom OS to give me loads of features I could not find on stock android, such as theming support on Android 9, Flashlight button while screen off, the ability to switch to classic android Back-Home-Recents layout, amongst other things. Eventually, I started having issues with the battery on my Essential, and in some ways it was lagging behind in the performance area with various apps being pretty stuttery and jumpy to use. I figured, it was time to get an upgrade. Out of the box, the Oneplus 7 Pro feels like a PREMIUM and beautifully designed device. It really reminds me how it felt when I bought the S9+ for the first time, but it's FAST. And it's running a custom nearly-stock android. If you are the sort to install custom roms for the features they give, I'm here to say Oxygen OS feels essentially like using the best of the best custom roms out there. It's built in a very clean, non-branded way, and gives me loads of features I would not have if I bought say... A Pixel 3A. (Which was my other phone of choice when shopping.) Now, for what REALLY bothered me about this phone (at first) was being unable to access my SIM card from Straight Talk (VZW variant.) It took me hours of customer support to basically find out that you have to edit the APN in the settings to be Straight Talk's and you're good to go. So it's not a big deal, but out of the box, it will not access 4G/LTE data.",1,"OnePlus"
"207","B07RCXCPV5",4,"false","The hardware design of the OnePlus 7 Pro is near to perfection. The biggest selling point is the lack of a notch, which truly makes for the most pleasurable viewing experience ever - 6” of edge-to-edge, crisp color! The only negative aspects of the hardware design are the lack of a MicroSD slot and wireless charging. These can actually be big enough drawbacks to outweigh the lack of a notch, but that’s what cloud storage and warp charge is for! I’m sure the OnePlus 8 Pro will eliminate these “mistakes,” but this phone will serve just fine for the foreseeable future. As for the software, while I see the benefit of being able to ultra-customize in Android, many of the apps just feel clunky to me...been with Apple from the beginning. Android 10 brings some nice additional features, but the app developers seem slow to update them. Nonetheless, I love the fact the Android SDK is free and there are lots of tutorials out there for making the most of the tech in which it resides, like using the phone as a bootable USB or optical drive. NOTE: Not sure how some sellers think $900+ for the 12GB RAM version is acceptable...it’s $750 on the OnePlus website and unlocking isn’t that difficult, certainly not worth an extra $150!",NA,"OnePlus"

So many cool little customizable features that I kept finding. Battery life is perfect, I get about 30-36 hours before I need to charge I use it casually, web searching, social media, music, photos, occasional gaming, etc. The only issue I had has nothing to do with the phone itself, but with Verizon and there lack of experienced tech support. Make sure when you switch the SIM card from your old phone to this phone that you write down the SIM card number that is on the SIM card itself because Verizon will need to know this in order to properly enter the phone and activate it in their system. It will still work otherwise except you may experience issues with service like I did. I could make and recei calls, I could send text but xout not receive text. I was on the phone for hours with Verizon and they kept asking me to looking in the settings to get the SIM card number, but I could not find a place in the phone that tells me the SIM card number. I finally spoke to someone who told me that the SIM card number is on the SIM card itself, so I pulled the SIM out, wrote down the number, gave it to the Verizon tech support guy and BOOM phone started working flawlessly.

"220","B07RCXCPV5",5,"true","So I came from a google pixel xl 1. There is some slight getting used to oxygen os but it's not too too different. One of the main things I notice is the lack of finger print reader on the back which I soon forgot about since the finger print reader in the screen is super quick --- I will talk about this further down. It's extremely snappy and the screen is amazing to look at with 60 hz and even better at 90 hz. One thing I like a lot is that you can pull down on an empty part of the screen to to accomplish the same you would with the pixel by pulling down on the fp reader on the back or down from the top edge of the screen. Ok so when I bought the phone and tried to set up my fingerprint, it would save it, but when I tried to unlock it would not work because it has a factory installed, and very hard to see screen protector film. I did not know this and it took calling Oneplus, Amazon, and Oneplus again. The first call, the guy dismissed it as a hardware problem and said I'd have to return to Amazon...I was like how is that Amazon's problem...Oneplus made the phone...you are responsible. Amazon tried to help me and they called Oneplus on my behalf and they said the same thing. So I called Oneplus again and Shae answered the phone and she was literally an angel. She helped me walk through all the steps of factory resetting (Which I already knew how to do, but I obliged in case i was missing something). After being on the phone with her for an hour we finally figured out the dang screen protector was still on the phone. I took it off and boom the fp scanner worked like a charm. They sent me 2 complimentary screen protectors and they covered shipping. I hate those things though and got dust in both of them and bubbles in them so I got pissed off and threw them away.

"223","B07S4755CM",5,"true","I've had the OnePlus 7 Pro in my hands for a little over a month now. First impressions: Build quality is excellent. The frame is solid with minimal body creases. It could fairly be compared to a well-designed aircraft. The mirror glass finish on the backing of the phone is beautiful--just keep in mind that if you dry dog your phones, you'll have it looking like cheeks inside of a day. The curved 6.67 inch QHD+ AMOLED display is absolutely gorgeous. The colors are well-balanced and vibrant, and maximum brightness is more than enough for any environment. Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical about the 90Hz refresh rate--but after using it for a month, I can honestly say that it is by-far the most fluid, responsive phone that I have ever used. It makes a HUGE difference coming from my old Pixel 3 XL. The popup selfie camera works fantastic. At first, I thought it was a bit gimmicky, but I don't use the front-facing camera nearly enough to come close to worrying about failure or damage to the mechanism. Battery life is decent. If you're halfway conservative about your brightness, you should easily be able to get through your day with moderate use. The Warp Charge feature is what I have been missing in my life. Undoubtedly the best feature of this phone. I can get a full charge inside of 80 minutes. If you get home after work with a near-dead battery, Warp Charge will give you enough juice with 20 minutes of wired charging to make it the rest of the night until you plug in before bed. The real MVP. The speakers are a massive improvement from the garbage speakers I've had on previous flagships. As good as you can get with a phone--they're immersive, deep, and fairly loud at max setting. No tinny or static sounds. My list of cons is pretty short, and I'm historically a very particular individual, so take these with a grain of salt. Con 1: Earpiece could definitely be louder. I find myself using the speaker when on calls. I usually hold my device just far enough away from my ear to keep my disgusting face grease from mucking up the display. However, on previous devices, the loudest earpiece setting was usually barely sufficient to hear at that distance, so I could easily get away with it. Con 2: The placement of the volume rocker across from the power button can pose issues for most users. When I go to adjust the volume while watching something, I almost always inadvertently take a screenshot because I pushed the power button with my thumb, or likewise, my pointer finger. (This will vary based on dominant hand, as well as device orientation.) Con 3: The camera. Well, coming from a phone with a single-lens camera rated best-in-class, I will say that the quality is definitely a bit underwhelming. At the end of the day, it gets the job done. I'm hoping OnePlus pushes some firmware updates that favor improving the camera software. Conclusion: This is a perfectionist phone for the perfectionist. Well worth the money. This phone easily trumps most, if not all, phones in the flagship class. The best part: you're most likely to have the only one in your group of people. In a cellular world polluted with cookie cutter Galaxy phones and other devices commonly found in copy-and-paste cellular stores, The OnePlus 7 Pro is the masterpiece sitting in the back--reserved for those who refuse to fall short.",20,"OnePlus"

The phone is nice and all that but I did not buy it for the niceties - just for the camera. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I took it for a test and for reference I used my existing Galaxy S9+. The difference in the quality of the pictures was so blatant that initially I thought that I must be doing something wrong: cleaned the lens, tried different settings - the results were the same. OnePlus produced constantly softer images comparing with S9+ that is rated only 99 at DXOMark (vs. 111 for OnePlus) As other users of OnePlus Forum pointed out, it is quite possible the copy of the phone that OnePlus submitted to DXOMark was tweaked specially for the test. Maybe they asked for a piece of advice from Volkswagen emission engineers? UPDATE Jun. 10: OnePlus has just released their new update Oxygen OS 9.5.7.

But to gain the extra performance and bezzless 90hz beautiful display with a pop out camera. It's all worth it 100000%.

"243","B07S4755CM",5,"false","I bought my OnePlus 7 Pro direct from OnePlus, so I can't attest to this particular seller. The phone though, is unbelievable, and easily the best Phone I've ever used. This is my first OnePlus, and I'm coming from a Pixel XL. The first thing I noticed was the huge display and heavy weight. The screen is gorgeous obviously, and I'd never be able to go back to anything with a bezel or less than 90 hz. Since I've always been a Nexus/Pixel fan, I place a premium on user experience and vanilla Android. The 7 Pro is a perfect combination of pure Android with some minor customizations, which are actually quite useful. The camera is surprisingly good, not a 10/10 and not on par with the Pixel or iPhone, but it's a lot better than I anticipated, especially the main camera and video stabilization. I also bought the Tech 21 case, which is the best one available IMO (available at TMobile retail locations or direct from Tech 21 website). I ordered several cases on Amazon and returned them since they didn't offer much protection. Anyway, I looked at the S10+ and iPhone Xs Max and strongly considered the Galaxy, but thrilled I went with OnePlus. The curved display is subtle and I haven't had any issues with accidental clicks or light distorting the view. Finally, the on-screen fingerprint scanner has been extremely quick and reliable. I think a lot of reviews made 2 months ago were done prior to OnePlus rolling out several software updates, cause the problems some people claimed to experience (battery life, camera) haven't been an issue for me. Great phone, thrilled I purchased it and would recommend to anyone that enjoys larger displays and vanilla Android.",17,"OnePlus"

"256","B07V3TL48P",4,"true","This is a great phone, and a truly excellent value for money: I got mine for $300, which for a flagship-quality phone with flagship specs that rival most mainstream brands at $900+, is amazing. It has a version of Android that is about as close to ""stock"" as you get without getting a pixel phone, but there is one minor issue that happens to be a deal-breaker for me: It breaks some of the seamless integration of Google Assistant. You can still say ""okay google"" out loud, and hold the home or power button to start it up, but none of that helps when your phone is in your pocket. The problem is how it works with bluetooth headphones: many allow you to push a button and speak directly to Assistant, no need to even say ""Okay Google"". It doesn't work with this phone, and no combination of settings fixes that. Researching on OnePlus forums revealed it's an issue with all OnePlus phones. Such integration only works when the phone is on & unlocked. I make extensive use of this feature while driving, getting directions, etc., so this was a deal breaker for me. Using this is ingrained in my daily routine, and digging in my pocket and turning on the phone is a big step down in convenience and not just dangerous but generally illegal while driving. If this isn't an issue for you, you'll love this phone. If it is, you may want to check out either the Asus Zenfone 6 or Xiaomi Mi 9t Pro. They're a little more expensive, but generally still very cheap phones fairly equivalent to expensive flagships from Samsung etc. the 9t Pro goes for about $400, Zenfone 6 $500 as of this writing, but both are also slight hardware upgrades using the fastest (as of this writing) Snapdragon 855 chipset. That's still a very small difference from the OnePlus 6t Pro which uses the 845 chipset, but both of these phones also get rid of the annoying ""notch"" in the screen in favor of popup cameras for front-facing use. Honestly, Assistant issue aside though, you can't go wrong with this phone.",1,"OnePlus"

Fortunately there are VERY easy and straightforward instructions to complete the unlock process on the xda developers forum. So while I was able to complete the unlock process myself, I was very frustrated that the phone came locked when it was very clearly advertised as unlocked. As for the phone itself, it is absolutely PHENOMENAL! This is easily the best bang for your buck currently available. It outpaces any of the ""mid-range"" phones with 600-series snapdragon processors, but at roughly the same cost.

Thankfully, downloading a Gcam port will have you snapping Google Pixel-quality photos in no time.",3,"OnePlus"
"284","B07V3TL48P",5,"true","This purchase turned out to be a no-brainer. Although this phone came in the wrong box, without a headphone dongle, no clear plastic case, no owners manual, and the cheapest power supply there is, the acquisition was a smart decision. I bought a case for $8 and proper quick-charging power supply for $27 which adds $35 to the price. (Real total = $325) Other than the above, this phone appears and works as well as a brand-new one. There isn't a single scratch anywhere and everything about the phone works just like it should. Occasionally, one does get a reconditioned dud, but this phone isn't one of them. YMMV, but I'd definitely buy this phone again and recommend buying it to a friend.",1,"OnePlus"
"285","B07V3TL48P",1,"true","Not sure why this is a common problem among the reviewers, but I too received a model without a sim tray. I purchased from MobileDealz, though I can't say the same for others. I suppose I should be grateful it doesn't appear a sim card has been lodged in without the tray, rendering it next to useless. I trusted maybe foolishly, but I don't feel I should have had to anticipate an additional purchase of a required part when I bought this. I'm in a crummy position with a prepaid sim card ready, but no functionable phone. Now I must wait longer for the part and hope my sim's activation period doesn't expire in the meanwhile. Such a letdown. My other complaints would be minor if not for the disconcerting inability to use my phone for work or family medical needs. Oddly it came in some generic, unbranded box with decorative greetings in many languages, which isn't an issue. Just simply peculiar. The next big letdown came after inspection of every crevice. Absolutely no instructional manual or inserts for quick ease of use. Excellent. This is my first smartphone. More disappointment over the missing protective case that comes standard with the original. No earbud dongle, or much of anything else. Just the 50% useful phone and a charging ater is a Lenovo of sorts. I wouldn't say the phone is valueless as it is quite beautiful, and appears to turn on. I'm just feeling a bit salty.",1,"OnePlus"

The cable that came in my package felt like it was going to break off or destroy my charger port, and there isn't a charger brick included.

"311","B07V3TL48P",5,"true","Advertising: The description mentioned that there would be no visible scratches from within 12"" away, and I can safely say that is a true statement. The phone was, indeed, T-Mobile branded when I received it as stated. Overall, the phone is as advertised. Shipping & Item condition: Arrived on time in a nice box (not OnePlus branded, however). Packaging was adequate to prevent damaging. Unfortunately it did not come with an official Oneplus Dash Charger. I simply received an Amazon charger that wasn't even USB-C. Thankfully I already had one on the way, so it was a non-issue for me, but something you should be prepared to purchase. Price: $346.95 - At the time I purchaced this (August 2019), this was about the best bang for your buck you could get in an Android phone. Oneplus was selling the 6T on their website still for about $600 new. I suspect this price to continue to drop once the 8 and 8 Pro are announced/Released. The 7T was already released, but unfortately not being sold in the US. Build Quality/Durability: This was my major concern with buying an Amazon renewed phone. I was very worried that I'd see scratches, have software issues, poor battery, or some other unknown problem. Thankfully, it didn't have a single scratch on it and looked/performed as a brand new phone. The battery health was over 90%. Simply put, I was very surprised to get what seems like a brand new phone for so cheap. Performance: I did a ton of research before purchasing a new phone. I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, and that thing was super sluggish and terribly slow after 5 years of use. I learned that Oneplus phones don't typically slow down as much as Samsungs, or other brands, and I really liked Oxygen OS. It seems very snappy and quick to load apps. The in-display fingerprint sensor can be hit or miss at times, but I seem to average an 80% success rate when I try to unlock my phone. I know the newer 7 Pro has an even better fingerprint sensor, but in my book the difference is negligible when considering the price of the Pro. I never liked playing games on my Samsung because of how sluggish everything was, but I've been finding myself playing more on this one. It's very quick and doesn't seem to overheat like my last phone. Design/Features: - I really like OxygenOS. It is quick, clean, and simple. I did not like, however, that it was T-Mobile branded. A quick youtube search led me to a video that helped me quickly (and I'm talking only 30mins here) convert it to the international unlocked version. Now I don't have to worry about delayed OS updates or lack of support from T-Mobile. I would recommend installing an App called Oxygen Updater, as it seems the international version won't automatically push updates to your phone. You would have to seek them out and manually install them. The App does that for you and works very well. - The teardrop notch is hardly noticeable. Almost all apps and games will simply reduce the screen size, so it looks like a black bar instead of a notch. I feel like this is a better solution than the pop-up camera on the 7 Pro. Moving parts on a cell phone simply don't give me confidence. - Honestly, my favorite feature is a dedicated slider for the ring-modes. Slide up once for vibrate mode, once again for silent, and all the way down for ring. It doesn't mess with the alarm volume, which is nice, and I now no longer need to go into the settings to change my modes. - I do not like, however, that there is no longer a dedicated notification LED. I've gotten used to it, however, as there is a setting to flash the screen briefly when there is a new notification. It's just not as ideal, IMO. Overall: I can't say enough how happy I am that I was able to get a practically brand new phone for so cheap. Yes, you'll have to spend a little more for an official charger, case, etc., but you'd likely be buying many of those things anyway, right? If not, you're in even better shape. Amazon renewed products also have a 90-day return window, which is a nice piece of mind. Overall I can safely say that I'm happy with this purchase and would definitely consider Amazon renewed products again in the future.",43,"OnePlus"
"312","B07V3TL48P",4,"true","For normal users: Couple of small scratches on the screen. For privacy caring users: Installation of privacy protecting software requires unlocked bootloader (not GSM unlock). It my phone the bootloader is locked. I applied for an unlock code. It takes up to 2 weeks to get it.",16,"OnePlus"
"313","B07V3TL48P",5,"true","The phone was just as described. The screen, back and camera lenses were like new (no scratches). The phone was a T-mobile unit and it was unlocked and doesn't have a lot of bloat-ware apps. The unit did have 8GB Ram and 128GB Flash which makes it a top performer. The AMOLED screen is top-quality. The battery life is very good for me (~48 hrs+) right now. Most importantly this is one of the few phones that DOES support WiFi-calling/text when used with a T-Mobile sim-card. This feature can't be added to generic ""international"" android phones that are unlocked. The camera works well, but is not as good as some of the newer 3+1 cameras found on other top-end phones. There is no ""ultra-wide"" angle mode. My only nit-pick was that this unit did not come with the factory charger, which is rated for 20Watts (5V/4A), instead an Amazon charger was included rated at only 9Watts (5V/1.8A) which will result in much longer recharge times. It did come with a simple USB type C cable, but no earphone adapter.",9,"OnePlus"
"314","B07V3TL48P",4,"true","Excelente teléfono, su condición es casi nueva, no se ve ninguna raya. Solo mencionar ningún accesorio original. Viene desbloqueado, al parecer viene instalada ROM de versión internacional que elimina lo relacionado a T-Mobile.

"315","B07V3TL48P",5,"true","The fingerprint reader might be slow at sometimes, but unlocking it with my face typically makes up for it. I had no problems with the device that was shipped, and it worked just as I expected. It runs smoothly, has a specific gaming mode, and charges really fast with the dash charger. One thing I will mention is that the Dash Charger is NOT included, so I had to buy that separately.",NA,"OnePlus"

"320","B07XVNDQMR",1,"true","It doesn't work. It came with a single sim tray, so when I put in my sim it gave the error ""Sim 2 not allowed"".

Go to oneplus.com/support/softwareupgrade to pull it down manually and install locally, then use Oxygen OS Updater from Play store to pull down Android 10/Oxygen OS 10.0.1 and it works great. A few micro-scratches near the USB C port, wear is barely noticeable. Excellent buy, very impressed and surprised by quality. Product is as advertised global dual SIM not carrier locked. Buy one",2,"OnePlus"
"322","B07XVNDQMR",5,"true","I try to be budget minded when it comes to today's highly replaceable tech. This phone replaced my Poco F1 which I enjoyed, but die to it's spotty North American signal coverage it was time to upgrade. Always been interested in the OnePlus brand. Good specs for good price (refurbished). Came with an Amazon 9W power block, cable, and USB C headphone adapter. Charged quick out of the box. The OnePlus UI is snappy, with no studder. Phone is quick, and battery lasts most of the day with moderate/heavy use. Definitely pleased with the purchase. My only complaints are: -no memory expansion. 128 GB isn't enough space for some of us -the main camera auto focus is temperamental, especially on close ups -the fingerprint reader is hit & miss. Sometimes it's quick, other times it fusses regardless which registered finger is used. Complaints that are easily lived with. Compromises for a great, fast, reliable smartphone for well less than the $1000+ flagships that are out there.",NA,"OnePlus"

"330","B07XVNDQMR",5,"true","I just picked up last year's model phone for less than half the original price. Yes, I could tell it was used. The back of the phone had small scratches. Do I care? No because I use a phone case. The front of the phone and screen looks new. The battery seems new. I was able to update to Android 10 without any problems. OnePlus 6T A6013 phone works perfect on T-Mobile without the bloatware. voice over Wi-Fi, voice over LTE, hotspot, Google pay all work normally.",1,"OnePlus"
"331","B07XVNDQMR",4,"true","Only had phone for a day but so far, so good. Little uncertain if new or refurb but it looks/operates as new. It is factory unlocked, no T-Mobile bloatware and OnePlus keeps it lean and mean. It is GSM only which is fine - my carrier is Consumer Cellular which uses AT&T and T-Mobile. Ran some diagnostic apps on it and it came through 100%. Reviews of the 6t are very good and the customer service at OnePlus was awesome answering questions even when I was just phone shopping. Set-up was painless. Still a few settings to work out but it's a computer that makes phone calls and we know all computers have their quirks. Overall though, the reviews are on spot - 4 out of 5 or better, kudos from GSM Arena, Android Police, PC Mag, Cnet, etc. and, yes, it is as fast as they say. Do have a case ready, it's a slippery little rascal. Unless something horrible happens, I'm a OnePlus convert - no more Samsung for me! My only concern was the way it was packed - it was secure inside its own box but that box was loose inside the shipping box. No harm done but made for some trepidation opening the box. The charger is a generic Amazon charger so if you want Dash charging (it's FAST), you need to buy one.",5,"OnePlus"

"333","B07XVNDQMR",5,"true","I just got the phone the other day, so far loving it. It was an Amazon ""Renewed"" product, I just received the phone in a plain white box that included the phone, an Amazon branded charging brick and an Amazon USB C cable. For the price, I guess that's Ok. The phone looked brand new with a protective plastic sheet over the screen and no scratches at all. Getting it activated on Simple Mobile was easy, had issues trying to transfer my number, which failed, but that's a different review. The phone is pretty fast with the Snapdragon 845 processor and 8 gigs of ram. This is the fastest phone I've ever owned, definitely worth $350. Everything worked like new. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone. I'ts a little on the heavy side, and a little large to use with one hand but I knew that when I bought it. Battery life is great compared to my last phone. I took it off the charger at 5:30 this morning, it's now 4pm and my phone is still at 81%, although I don't use my phone as much as some people do. It's a great option if you're looking to buy a phone outright.",3,"OnePlus"
"334","B07XVNDQMR",4,"true","Actual rating is 4.5 stars! Excellent performance in its price range. Purchased an Amazon Renewed model from Edge Cellular. Quick and easy transaction. Item received appears to be new, no scratches or imperfections at all. This model is capable of using all of TMobile's channels in the US and so far Data/Internet performance has been outstanding. There is no 3.5 mm headphone jack and no SD card storage but with 128 gb there should be enough storage. The real test for me will be voice/data/internet performance on my upcoming business trip. Update: Happy to report that this phone works well in Dominican Republic. Call quality is good and internet performance is adequate considering network situation. Summary: Best value for TMobile customer requiring international voice/data coverage. Camera performance is adequate but not great...but you're spending less than half the cost of similar models.",3,"OnePlus"

I can't even look at things on chrome for over a minute without it freezing. The camera isnt that great. 48 mega Pixel should be good but it's pretty bad. I like the super macro but I mean how am I supposed to take picture of a beautiful snow mountain with that? I like the fact you can customize the colors of the fonts and stuff but it's not really worth $600. The fingerprint reader hardly works. It detects my right thumbprint 4/5 times and left thumbprint 1/5 no matter how often I retain it. I have 500/500 Mbps internet speed and it can't keep up with it, takes awhile to open a website. Idk why people compare this phone to the Pixel because the Pixel is 100x better. You can have all the best hardware but if your software sucks then it's pointless.
