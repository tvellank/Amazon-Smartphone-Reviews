"14","B07FM9913M",1,"true","I LOVED this phone!!! I hope those who have it already never experience this issue. I had it for 8 months with no problems. It woked really well and I love the large screen. However, I like a lot of people, have experienced it going into a bootloop that is impossible to get out of. I'm very sad! This is my 2nd xiaomi purchase (no issues with the a1, I just wanted an upgrade). I guess this is the risk of no warranty. I would say save your money on this particular model. Xiaomi A1 is awesome and I've heard good things about the Redmi note 7. Also look on YouTube for ""top budget phones"". Lots of great options without the flagship prices.",NA,"Xiaomi"

"24","B07FM9913M",4,"true","The phone did not come with a charger so I was using several of my chargers from past phones. This phone requires a beefy charger. I spent around $20 on a QC 4.0 30W with USB C on both ends of the fast charging cable. The phone now charges, and charges super quick. But the right charger, and you'll be happy with the phone.

"28","B07FM9913M",5,"true","I've only had this phone for a couple weeks. So far it has performed well above expectation. It is fairly responsive, and I was happy to get all of the android updates right away. There are not many bells and whistles in the interface, which I really appreciate. I was glad I was able to customize the feeds, and remove sources I don't trust. The fingerprint scanner is very responsive. The InfaRed was a nice little bonus, because I tend to lose remotes, but rarely my phone. It came with a usbC to headphone jack. It was noticeably missing NFC, but I am able to use my hardware keys with a male usbC to female usbA adapter (probably more secure anyways). Since this is the ""International Global Version"" it came with a European plug, and an adapter for use in the US. It's kinda a clumsy plug. I plug directly into my USB wall outlet, so it wasn't a big deal for me. All in all, I think it was a very good deal, as long as it holds up over time.",NA,"Xiaomi"
"29","B07FM9913M",3,"true","Seems like alot or phone for the money. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it seems to have random issues with not receiving calls or delayed text sending (in the us in mint / TMobile) didn't seem to have these issues on my lg g6 . Camera is not bad. Not as good as my few yrs older lg G6 but not really the same price range phone. Still trying to figure out what it works with in America . Supposedly it doesn't get lte or 3g on mint but it does . Maybe not call bands lte? If it worked %100 reliable on this carrier it would be a crazy good deal",NA,"Xiaomi"

"38","B07FM9913M",2,"true","I've only been using this phone for less than 5 months and it was working perfectly fine. I would even say it was my favorite phone up until it got ""corrupted"" and won't turn on. I'm assuming it's a manufacturer defect considering there's no physical damage and the corruption came out of nowhere. On another note, I did buy the same phone for my boyfriend a month after I purchased mine and his is holding up fine, hence why I'm thinking it's a defect rather than the phone itself. It's been a few days now and the seller hasn't responded. I'm really hoping I get a refund or replacement for this issue.",1,"Xiaomi"

It does not have a headphone jack, WiFi calling, or a slot for a SD Card and the battery can't be removed. Couple months of owning this phone and it's alright. It will stop data or go into 3G. Never ever had that happen with any other phone. The screen gets stuck for a few seconds numerous times a week. Overall its still good for the price.

"66","B07FM9913M",1,"true","Had the phone for 3 months, worked fine UNTIL AN AUTOMATIC FIRMWARE UPDATE BRICKED THE PHONE. Xiaomi pushed a bad update that bricked a lot of people's phone and will do nothing to help anyone who bought their phone from unauthorized sellers (US sellers Amazon, etc.) Xiaomi as a company DOES NOT PROVIDE INTERNATIONAL WARRANTY meaning that they WILL NOT DO ANYTHING unless you bought it in china or from an authorized seller. So unless you've enabled OEM unlock bootloader and USB debugging on your phone beforehand you can't flash the bad update. You'll have do jump hurdles to undo it and sometimes you'll be SOL. SO BE CAREFUL BEFORE BUYING XIAOMI PHONES. YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE A $200 PAPER WEIGHT",1,"Xiaomi"

It runs really well even with games that generally take longer to load. There is virtually no waiting time. There are some features that I am in love with, especially the feature that tells you what apps you never use and suggests you delete them. Occasionally the fingerprint reader needs a second try, but it is very fast and is generally quite accurate. Much better than Apple phones, which can't even read my fingerprint.

I didn't even have the fingerprint sensor issue that most users reported to have. As much as i loved the phone i could not stand the battery and as such had to let this phone go but for the price its still big value and if battery matters to you check out the A2 lite with a not so slower processor and worse camera or the A3 with a 720p screen and not so faster processor.",1,"Xiaomi"

"91","B07FM9913M",5,"true","Very dood deal. There are 3 poits which you have to set right before writing a review about this smartphone; 1) It is a 170 usd smartphone. 2) Smartphones are technology devices and you need to have a minimum of experience about it to set a standard configuration or manage some issues with it. 3) The smartphone comes with Android one. Read about it. Positive and negative things which brings you this OS. Some times, what is bad for others is good for you and reverse. For me, the only negative about this smartphone is the battery, but I can't complain about it. Before ordering it, I had the information about the low capacity the battery have. Yes it have a little 3000 mhh battery which last only a day, like most of 500 or 800 usd smartphones. Very good material, Acceptable camera, excellent fingerprint, good screen and cheap.",NA,"Xiaomi"

"105","B07FM9913M",3,"true","This phone seemed like the perfect budget smartphone. Great feeling build quality, decent processor and pretty good camera. But unfortunately it didn't turn out to be a pleasant experience for me. First of, I understood that it was a Global phone with only limited bands that worked in the U.S. from my research it supported 2 of the lte bands for TMobile so I figured that was alright, especially for the price, but reception was horrible. I was getting extremely terrible signal and when I did have full bars of signal, the speeds were horrid. Obviously ymmv with that one depending on your area and your daily environment. Battery life was another downfall, I would only get about 3 hours of on screen time on a good day. Disabling digital well being in Android pie did help a bit however. And my last big negative was the storage. No, my issue was not the size and the fact that there's no sd card, but that the emmc memory they used had some issues which caused maybe slowdowns during everyday use. Apps would constantly freeze and lag. Sorting files and transferring files from and to a PC was frustrating. But now for some pros. The camera was fantastic, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the picture taken from this phone. I've read that using a Gcam port would improve the quality of images significantly but there sick camera was pleasant enough. Build quality of this phone felt amazing for the price. Felt very solid to hold, didn't feel cheaply made. And 2 last pros were the ir blaster which was a pleasant surprise and that it runs clean, stock Android. In the end, I really wanted to love the phone, but had to return it for it's short comings, maybe your experience will differ but that's my take on the phone",NA,"Xiaomi"

"107","B07FM9913M",5,"true","As my title say, this phone is a beast. I have never regretted buying this at all. Coming from an s5 I must say storage capacity is better from 16 to 64, value for money is amazing it's so thin and lovely, I also hate lite phones but this is just right. Battery life is extremely powerful, it last roughly 24 to 33 hours, yes it's the truth. Well the camera speaks for itself. Vivid, sharp in every shots you won't regret. I won't hesitate to recommend this product, the snappyness is off the chain likewise the ram management. Enjoy",NA,"Xiaomi"
"108","B07FM9913M",5,"true","I broke the screen on my Galaxy S9, and the Mi A2 was cheaper than a screen replacement. I figured it would be a temporary phone until I figured out what to do, but this thing is awesome. It is stock Android, which is a much better interface and cleaner, easier apps than Samsung's preinstalled junk. It's fast, looks great, has a great camera, and has good battery life (but all new phones do, so we'll see how it is in a year...). My wife has a Pixel 3, and they look very similar, especially when the screens are on and the stock Android is showing. The A2 is a little thinner than the Pixel 3. Camera quality is comparable, but the selfie camera automatically applies mild filters and it looks like the video stabillization isn't as good. Low light is as good as or better than the S9, but I hesitate to say it's better than the Pixel because the Pixel is so good at low light images. No SD card :( The screen looks great, but it definitely looks different than the Samsung OLED. It lists a slower processor than the Pixel or S9, but I've had no problems running lots of background apps and switching between intensive apps like nav and games. I haven't noticed any performance difference from the S9. All in all, a shockingly good phone for less than the cost to replace the screen on most flagships. I really hope AndroidOne keeps going, and Mi keeps selling phones in the US.",NA,"Xiaomi"

"132","B07FM9913M",5,"true","This is, without a doubt, the best budget phone in the market - at least for the late 2018 and early 2019. I'm not saying that this device can or should be equated to an Apple iPhone X or similar; but for a small fraction of the price, it works wonders. It features many of the flagship phone characteristics such as 20 MP double camera and dual flash, 20MP front camera and flash, fingerprint scanner, 4GB of ram, 8-core processor, and USB type C. The main advantage of the phone, however, is Android One with all that it implies: a crisp, easy-to-use interface, native Google apps, and early access to OS upgrades and the latest security patches. The only downsides, which for the price shouldn't be so relevant, are its 3000mAh battery, which can last up to a day, and the lack of a headphone jack. Still, that shouldn't restrain a phone user who's looking to acquire an inexpensive-but-quality phone from buying it. There are affordable Bluetooth headsets to make up for the lack of a headphone jack and cheap power banks to charge up the phone on the go, in case you need it. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this device to someone who needs to work from their phone, or use social media, someone who wants to have the stock Android experience, and is acquainted with the Google ecosystem. For such a ridiculously low price, you can't ask for more.",NA,"Xiaomi"

I wish they would ferm up the on-off button or move it up above the sound buttons as it is soft touch and too easy to turn off while grabbing up the phone and answering a call. suggest using supplied case that comes with it that improves the situation but does not completely solve it. would like like to see a larger battery as this phone deserves it.my wife gets about 6 hours of heavy use out of it between charges .charger is fast.about 2 hours. overall it is a very good phone and supplier shipping was fast.",1,"Xiaomi"

I thought the phone was awesome at first, and it has great performance for the price, but this issue makes the phone unusable.

"153","B07FM9913M",5,"true","When I bought this phone I did not have high expectations. The idea was to use it during my overseas vacation and if I did not like it, no big loss because it was so inexpensive (1/4 of the price of the cheapest iPhone). From the moment I tore the seal and opened the box, however, I realized that I may have been wrong. The phone came with a factory case, the build looked superb and the body was thin and light. The first impression turned into a total surprise when I set it up and put a Metro PCS SIM in it. The experience was flawless. In my opinion, Android One is the finest operating system around without exceptions (my work phone is an iPhone 8 Plus). There is no bloatware and it receives all updates from Google, not Xiaomi. Soon after I bought it, the operating system was upgraded to Android 9, again directly by Google. I am yet to see a single app whose Android version is different or inferior to the iOS version. The user experience is identical, which helped me switch seamlessly between the two operating systems on my two phones. One Android feature that I was not aware of but liked very much is the unlimited backup of the phone by Google (no iCloud like space limitations and no need to do the backup through a computer program like iTunes). The Mi A2 is fast, the phone reception and data speeds are excellent, the screen is sharp and bright, the video and games are smooth, the camera is better than my work phone, the speaker is clear, the fingerprint reader is logically placed in the back and very fast despite the claim in one of the negative reviews (at least as fast as my work phone), the battery lasts a full day of heavy usage (half of the time using video) and two days of normal usage, and charges faster than any smartphone that I have ever owned (Android or iPhone). The phone does not have a notch at the top, which is a big plus. Knowing what I know now I would buy it again without hesitation.",2,"Xiaomi"

"155","B07FM9913M",1,"true","At a glance, the Xiaomi A2 seems like an excellent choice for a budget phone with really good features. The phone has a decent CPU, its Bluetooth stack supports LDAC, the camera is decent. However, it has one MAJOR flaw: It's primary function which is making/receiving calls is VERY UNRELIABLE. I use T-Mobile, on a single day the phone entered into ""Invalid Sim Inserted"" state, I almost missed a work call, and then missed a VERY important call. I need a phone that is reliable 24/7. This can happen at any given time, and the only solution is to reboot the phone. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone that needs their phone for work, or relies upon it. Otherwise, the phone has decent features. I give it one star.",3,"Xiaomi"

So to give some backstory, this phone was great with Android 9 and a great camera and strong haptic engine, and this phone also gets monthly security updates, which were fine until this month's update. FOLLOWING THE UPDATE, THE PHONE IS BRICKED AND IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE. As you may have seen other users complain about this issue, it IS TRUE and WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR DEVICE AT SOME POINT. Anyway, if you still want to waste your money with this device, then ALWAYS KEEP DEVELOPER OPTIONS ON AND HAVE THE BOOTLOADER UNLOCKED WITH USB DEBUGGING ON so that if this brick happens, then you can reinstall a stock ROM or MIUI to this device. Still, there are better options out there like the Honor 8X(great value, check it out) or the BOLD N1(flagship specs for only $200) which will give you a better experience(based on the reviews) with less risk of bricking. Even if you are still ignoring the bad reviews like I did, now there are a numerous amount of people with this issue and do not buy the device.

I notice that when I disconnect it on wifi it wouldn't drop anymore. Restarting helps when I was having an issue with a bluetooth connection. Love having easy access to grayscale and invert colors on the dropdown menu. When out on a sunny day, the screen is not as bright as I'd like. Rear camera is nice! Lovely shots in dark places.

"205","B07FM9913M",4,"false","My original review is below, but I wanted to update it by saying as of June, the ads that were infesting my phone (for more than 3 months) are gone. I can't explain how or why, but they suddenly disappeared. Maybe it wasn't the phone... maybe it was an app or a glitch that an update fixed? I really don't know. I'm updating my review from 2 stars to 4. I can't quite bring myself to give it 5 due to the rough patch I went through with it, the camera can be slow at times on the video or portrait setting, and that I still can't trust it to deliver my text messages in a timely manner, but mostly, I love my phone. The battery seems to be just fine, too. (Probably because it's not popping up ads as a constant hobby) ORIGINAL REVIEW: I want to love my phone. I really do. But I can't get the pop-up ads to go away. While I'm writing a text message. While I'm checking my calendar....etc. I've gotten 3 ads in under a minute at times. It was the perfect phone for the first 30 days, then--it turned. I believe the pop-up ads are what they use to recoup the cost of the this great phone at the great, low price. It has a fantastic camera, but it's no good if an ad pops up while I'm trying to use it. The battery was great (for the first 30 days), but then it suddenly stopped performing as well. The days it couldn't make it all the way through without a charge, I checked my phone usage for the day and it was just under 2 hrs. I could live with the battery issue if I wasn't so frustrated by the ads popping up. I've searched the internet on how to stop them, but the methods I've found don't work. ALSO, many of the text messages I send or receive are delayed, sometimes by hours. Never had this issue with my old phone. Same sim card. Do I recommend this phone? No. Is my camera phone better than yours? Probably. But the beating I take from pop-up ads when using this phone... so. not worth. it.",1,"Xiaomi"

Pros: -It is a really nice looking phone and it is really thin. -It is super light and the design overall is very nice. -The screen is very colorful especially for a LCD screen. -The performance is great even after installing a few dozen apps. I never experienced any slow downs or hiccups. I was really impressed by how fast this phone was considering that it has a snapdragon 660. I am not a super heavy user but I do use my phone a lot for media and some games. -Fast charger is awesome! Cons: -The screen is dim in direct sunlight or outside on a cloudy day even at full brightness. -No LTE but it has 4G, which is still really fast but not as fast as LTE. -The phone had trouble staying connected to 4G networks and would often connect to H (HSDPA) instead, which is really 3.5G. I would have to restart the phone in order for it to connect to 4G networks, which got annoying quickly. This continued to happen even after I selected that I preferred 4G netowrks in the settings. I also tried this in 2 locations about 80 miles apart and the same issue occurred. -The battery life was pretty good but it could use a bit more juice. With my daily usage (5-6 hours with lower brightness) I would need to top off a bit later in the evening around 8pm.",10,"Xiaomi"

"222","B07FM9913M",1,"true","During the first two months of purchase the camera was working great, after two months on it's own the camera quality is extremely bad.

"223","B07FM9913M",3,"true","No headphone jack... which means you can not use a wired headphone or hook this to your car stereo without using the USB dongle. If you use the dongle, the phone can't be charging. That might be fine for some people but it does not meet my needs. When I plugged the phone in to charge and turned it on and connected it to my Wi-Fi and started downloading its update information, Google Drive kept crashing. There was nothing I could do to stop it. I would clear the pop-up notification and it would immediately reappear, making it very difficult to enter information for other apps that needed input. I have absolutely no doubt that if you deleted Google drive from the phone and reinstalled it from the Play Store it would have fixed the problem. However, I just did not have time to mess around with the phone to correct something that shouldn't have been a problem to begin with. The charger that came with the phone was European spec. Taped to the outside of the box was a US outlet adapter. An absolutely horrible setup for a a serious phone in the US. While the phone does come with 64 GB of of internal storage, as all of my apps were downloading from Google Play Store, the phone reported there was not enough internal storage space to install. Checking the phone's storage, it reported only 27% in use. To make matters worse, there is no ability to add a memory card. There is no external slot for memory. That was really the deal-breaker for me. If I couldn't install all the apps I had on my prior phone with less storage, then something was definitely wrong with this phone. As the headline suggests, this might be a really good phone for some people but it was too much of a hassle to get up and running for me so I returned it.",1,"Xiaomi"
"224","B07FM9913M",5,"true","This is an initial impression after a week of use. OK, I know that most people usually like an item they have just purchased. I know this review will be more useful and detailed after I've lived with the device for a month or two. However, one feature of this stands out so starkly, that I want to give anyone looking for a phone the an understanding of its benefits. Namely, this phone contains an unadulterated version of Android called ""Android One."" Android One is the Android O.S. as it was always meant to be. That means ABSOLUTELY ZERO ""CRAPWARE"" that only serves to bog down your device and add APPS or ""features"" that you would never have chosen yourself. Today's Android phones often resemble the old Packard Bell PC's that came with all kinds of ""special offers"" designed to provide the manufacturer with additional post-sales income, often by tricking you into purchasing software or subscriptions to things for which much better stand-alone alternatives exist. Android one is just Google Android. PERIOD! There are no offers to download audio books, no special shopping apps, no photo printing apps. NOTHING except the robust features of the Android Operating System. And because of this, you will receive the updates to the OS just as soon as Google releases them. You are not in any way at the mercy of your phone manufacturer who will inevitably need to make sure that the update works with the crapware they include with their ""customized"" (aka bastardized) version of Android. You even have the option of uninstalling parts of Android you don't care for. If you have spent hours trying to ""root"" your ""Android"" device, you can make sure you have a pre-rooted OS by simply buying a phone like this one with Android One!",1,"Xiaomi"

Fast forward to a week later and it just updated to 9 again OTA and I'm on Straight Talk. Pros: Great screen, awesome Android experience, very fast fingerprint reader, Update to Pie gives lots of great updates, USB Type C charging, Camera is awesome and nothing fancy Cons: Battery size is a little small but the software makes up for it, Definitely needs a case because of the camera hump, Speakers are a little soft but they work Overall: For the price you really can't beat this phone and with Android One on board it's definitely a steal.",10,"Xiaomi"

"303","B07FM9913M",4,"true","2 week review: I have been wanting to try Xiaomi for about over a year already because of all the great things I've heard about them. I'm a Samsung user since the Galaxy S2 but been a Note owner since since the Note 4. My Note 9 got stolen about a month ago and stupid Samsung Premium Care does NOT cover theft or loss. So I was stuck without my beautiful Note 9 and the hefty price tag that I still have to pay off. Anyways. . . about the Xiaomi Mi A2. I was very skeptical about getting this but the perfect time to get it after my phone was stolen.. Thought about it long and hard. I watched various YouTube review videos and it had nothing but great things about it. Debated between the Redmi Note 6 Pro and the Mi A2 Lite and everything pointed towards this. The set up was so easy and with the Android One UI, it felt very familiar. I love the Android One UI because it is so smooth and simple. The screen is actually very crisp and sharp. Colors look nice and touch screen is smooth and seamless. Only issue is that it can be a little difficult to see outdoors in direct sunlight but it's not to the point you can't see or read your screen. The Snapdragon 660 Chipset is very smooth. I have not had the phone glitch on me at all. I am a heavy PES (soccer game) user and it has been flawless while playing. The battery life is good when I'm not playing PES a lot but I do wish it had a larger capacity. It has rapid charging technology and charges so quickly that it doesn't really bother me. Battery from 5:30am until I get home around 6pm usually is around the 20%. The camera is good not great (comparing it to the Note 9 though). That is the one thing I would say I miss the most about my Note 9. Besides that, I really don't see myself missing the Note 9 that much. Especially at this price! If this phone continues to perform well and hold up nicely, I can see myself purchasing one of Xiaomi's higher end devices in the $400-$500 range with better camera's and processors and saying goodbye to overly priced Samsung Phones. I do recommend paying the extra $50 and getting the one with 128GB of memory and 6GB of RAM. I do find sometimes that my apps will refresh and reboot when I go back to them if I've opened a few apps. The 6GB RAM will help with keeping apps that you're going back and forth to open where you left off. So the only real cons about this phone is no wireless charging, no NFC and the battery capacity. Besides that, I highly recommend this phone to anyone and would not hesitate to buy it. Works great here in Phoenix, AZ on T-Mobile network by the way! I get 40+ Mbps at my house so it's very good.",3,"Xiaomi"

I have seen some people complaining about the picture quality, so I have attached pictures that I have taken with the front and back cameras on the phone. I love the cameras and I think they are amazing quality pictures. The front camera does have some type of skin blurring effect, which I really love because I have acne scars. The only complaint that I can see with this phone is that it does have somewhat of an issue staying connected to 4G, and it doesn't have LTE at all. Also, it has no MicroSD slot, which made me sad because I had to manually transfer all of my old pictures onto my new phone. Other then those issues, which are slight in my opinion, the phone is really exceptional. The sound quality is nice and loud and clear. Runs fast and can handle a lot of tasks at once.

"350","B07FM9913M",5,"true","FULL REVIEW ON PHONE - So look this phone is great. It cost me $215 and works great with T-Mobile. I live out in the country so I always look at cell providers service map and T- Mobiles map is highly detailed regarding the kind of service you will get. This phone actually gets better reception then what there map says I should. Xiaomi is eyeing up the US market in 2019 so they are gearing a lot of there phones to be fully compatible with US cell carriers and this phone is no exception. The LTE bands work great. I have Mint Mobile who is a MVNO through T-Mobile and I get up to 100mbps with them when I have full service with this phone. The phone has a GREAT Snapdragon 660 AI Processor. This is the cheapest phone you will find that comes with an authentic Snapdragon 660. Because it has such a great processor it is very quick and runs games like Players Unknown Battleground and Asphalt 9 on the highest settings without any frame rate loss. However, if you are a Fortnite player due to restrictions on the GPU card that is paired with the SnapDragon 660, it won't be able to run it at this time. That's on Fortnite's end not the phones end. If it can run PUBG fine on the highest settings it surely could run Fortnite. The finger print scanner is super fast. The phone is fully upgradable to Android Pie 9.0. A lot of phones come with bloatware however this phone does not. It comes with Android One which is the organic version of Android Pie not some companies overlays and skins. Basically Android One is the way Android was designed to run from Google. Because there is no bloatware it adds to the speed. This phone WILL 100% WORK WITH TMOBILE & ATT. It will also work with all there MVNO's like Cricket, Metro PCS, Mint Mobile. This phone WILL NOT WORK with CDMA carriers like Verizon or Sprint If you want cheap cell service I HIGHLY recommend Mint Mobile. It's like $24 a month if you pay for a few months up front and works great with this phone. The only downside I see is there is no expandible memory in this phone however it comes in 64gb and 128gb models so that should be plenty. If you take lots of pictures you can always keep them on the Google cloud. The phone comes with unlimited picture storage on Google cloud, if you save the picture as ""standard"" quality. Some people complain about the battery size however they are not realizing that this phone comes with such a power efficient processor. So it works great. If you play graphic intensive games like me it will last 5-6 hours if your browsing the web 8-10 hours if your just texting and calling with mild web use it will last all day. Don't worry about the wording INTERNATIONAL OR GLOBAL VERSION. This phone rocks. If your on the edge then just buy it you won't be sorry. 30 DAY UPDATE: I've been really enjoying this phone. I've had zero issues regarding performance or battery power. This phone will run pretty much every single app on the app store unless the app developer chooses not to support this phone specific processor. I Dropped it once with just the stock silicone case that came with the phone and it held up great. Not even a dent. It is really well built. As stated above the fingerprint scanner is superb. I got the Xiaomi Mi A2 & she got the Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite. Both phones are amazing. If you want a bigger battery w/ expandible memory go with the Most A2 Lite it comes with Snapdragon 625. As long as Xiaomi doesn't pull a One Plus move and raise prices I will be a Xiaomi customer for life. My cell service Mint Mobile (via Tmobile) has been fantastic. I did some more research and the next cheapest phone with this processor is $425. So this phone is a STEAL at $215. UPDATE 90 Days: So I've had this phone for 3 months now and it is still in mint condition. I dropped it twice from high up in the stock silicone case that comes with it. I'm 6'4"" and not even a scratch. It still runs the newest apps like a champ. The battery lasts significantly longer the I originally anticipated. I'm moderate user and do use it as my primary internet device. I charge it maybe ever night to every day and a half. So there is no issues with the battery. Also the unlimted ""Standard"" pictures that you are allowed to save to Google cloud for free is awesome. I'm a Xiaomi believer now. This is by far one of the best brands you can get for the price. They have a USA customer for life!! 90 Days in & I STILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND",130,"Xiaomi"
"351","B07FM9913M",4,"true","Probably the most powerful (or close to) device you can find in this price range. Great processor, plenty of ram and storage space.

Other minor cons are no expandable storage (I don't need it), and no headphone jack (but you get a dongle). Call quality is good, data here in the Midwest is fine for me. Slim selection of cases.

"368","B07FM9913M",4,"true","My husband and I were looking to upgrade from our LG X Charge's from Cricket Wireless. The price had recently dropped to $215 and we jumped on it. Pros: CAMERA. Best camera I've seen on a budget phone. It takes incredible photos with great color accuracy and the selfies really pop. The 20 megapixel low light lens really helps get the extra detail in those low light conditions. IT'S FAST! This phone's 4 GB of RAM is plenty to do your daily tasks and gaming. We never saw any slow down during our use and it's even better since it has received the Android Pie update! ANDROID ONE. Pure stock Android makes this a very easy phone to use and the adaptive battery and display really helps on battery life. Not sure how I would be able to go back to non Android One phones after this. Cons: BATTERY LIFE. Not the worst battery life that I've seen, I'd say it's adequate for average users. I usually average about 6hr30mins of screen on time on an average day of use. SCREEN BRIGHTNESS. The screen itself is fine, but the actual overall brightness isn't the best. If you are going to do some extended outside use you may need to keep the brightness on max and cover the phone with your hand to see it. Overall great phone for the price.

"370","B07FM9913M",3,"true","MY EXPERIENCE Previously I owned a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro, I expected the same level of quality from Xiaomi as that phone had been a delight to use. Instead the phone is only passable. My suspicion is that the collaboration of android and Xiaomi in developing the phone was not so symbiotic. The result is a buggy and inconsiderate user experience. Do yourself a favour and dig through the many forums about this phone as I should have. MY MAJOR ISSUES Most notable in my experience is that after a day of use the fingerprint reader can take a literal counting 15 seconds to unlock the phone, restarting makes the reader snappy yet it only slows down with use. Secondly, in a recent update they modified the UI, yet neglected to accommodate for the taller aspect ratio creating a black bar at the top of the screen in the quick settings menu. CLOSING This phone is cheap, shipping from amazon.com to Canada the phone cost $200. Stock android means the integration with google apps is seamless, google photos instead of a gallery app is one of my favourite details. Every issue I've encountered with this phone is fixable in updates, and the android one program does promise to give this phone extra attention. If you can get your hands on a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro it is still my favourite phone ever and I would highly recommend it over this phone. However, as I said before this phone is passable and for the price every issue is pretty liveable. Its not a satisfying answer but its true.",NA,"Xiaomi"

"389","B07FM9913M",5,"true","I bought this phone for just over $200, and i have to say, i am not disappointed. The screen is great, the touch id works great, face recognition and battery life is kind of ''meh'', but im not complaining. The battery usually lasts the whole with medium usage (a few videos, lots of social media, and a few light games), and the facial recognition works pretty well, albeit not as reliably or as fast as a fingerprint, but its faster than a password, and if you're too lazy to move your finger a little, it works fine, even in surprisingly dark lighting. I upgraded from a dated iPhone SE, and i gotta say im loving it after a week and a half of usage. I gave my old phone away and i havent missed it whatsoever. For $200, i highly recommend this phone if you're on a budget. Now, my only complaint is, sadly, the camera's. Despite the front and rear cameras being 20mp and 12+20mp respectively, I learned that megapixels dont mean amazing cameras. They arent horrible, but they are a bit on the low-end side of things. The portrait mode on the rear cameras works pretty well most of the time, blurring out only the smallest of details in the fore ground (maybe a small branch or something like that). I can live with the lower end cameras on the phone, as i have a dedicated digital camera, but dont pick up this phone for exclusively taking pro-grade pictures, you'll have a bad time. all in all, great phone for the price, it's quick and hasn't lagged once so far, and i love it.

"406","B07FM9913M",2,"true","For a full review of the phone itself, scroll below. I'll start with a review of the seller Phone-Zone: Since my order is older than 3 months, I couldn't submit a seller review anymore (why Amazon?), so I'll do it here: I gave the second phone I bought as a gift to my nephew. He called a day later and said the phone is ""stuck"" (see below in my review) and I had to take it back. The phone was bricked (wouldn't get it to start even once). Asked Amazon for an extension on return, since I was out of the country. Shipped back to seller as soon as I got back. They charged **30% restocking fee** because I sent ""outside of return period"". And are they ""restocking"" it? Are they going to send this bricked phone to the next unlucky user? Amazon did the right thing and refunded the rest. Avoid Phone-Zone like the plague. Horrible seller. 1 star. I bought 2 of these (from 2 different sellers): one for myself, that works great. The screen is amazing, the battery life surprisingly good. It worked well in 4 different countries I traveled to. The fingerprint reader is iffy (50% of the time it didn't recognize any finger), but I can live with that. The lack of headphone jack can be corrected with a good set of Bluetooth buds, or by using the included USB-C to 3.5 connector. All in all, I'll give it 4 stars. BUT the second phone, bought from Phone-Zone (see above) was bricked right out of the box. It was stuck in a restarting loop - you see the logo, black screen, and then it restarts. And there's nothing you could do to stop it. Since you can't take out the battery in this phone, this loop ran for 2 weeks before dying. Searching the internet showed many people suffer from a restart loop, and had to resort to hacking the ROM to solve it. Due to these seeming QC issues, I have to give this phone 2 stars: 4 stars divided by my 2 experiences. If you get a working one, it's great. If not - send it back fast, and don't eat any ""restocking fees"" from unscrupulous sellers.",NA,"Xiaomi"

"408","B07FM9913M",3,"false","The wi-fi drops constantly. I know this is an issue with the phone and not my wi-fi as my Switch, 3DS, PS Vita, PS4, and Sony Xperia Z3 (phone I had prior to this one) can all connect to the same wi-fi from the same distance with 0 issues; no dropping at all. I pretty much exclusively use this phone at home for playing mobile games, but the wi-fi dropping every 2 minutes makes it a ridiculous hassle. Also, the only plug the phone came with was a European power adapter so I had to plug it into my PS Vita brick to actually charge the phone. Aside from that the phone is actually pretty nice, it looks sleek, it can run any game I throw at it perfectly, battery lasts about 5 hours when I'm constantly playing games on it, and takes really nice photos too, especially for the price; if it wasn't for the wi-fi issue I'd really love this phone.",3,"Xiaomi"

As long as you are not one of those people that have to be on social media 24/7 I think it would be fine for most people. I also believe the screen is taking up the majority of the juice.

"410","B07FM9913M",5,"true","I ordered this after several phone mishaps. My old Galaxy S7 had finally died in about December of last year, and I was shopping around for a new phone. I blew through two phones that I had bought for around this price point (in fact, I think a little more expensive) that had been really disappointing. Long story short, neither lasted much longer than a month before becoming completely unusable. I was shopping around a lot for a phone that could do the job for a low price point (as I'm sure you can imagine, going through two phones in a few months shreds your finances), and I found this. After using it everyday for the past two months or so, I can wholly recommend it. Keep in mind that it does sacrifice some bells and whistles. It does not have NFC, for example. But if that's something you can live without, then this is a great phone. It has a modern design with a clean, simple, and chic look. The camera is pretty good, and in my experience, the fingerprint sensor works really, really well. The microphone and speaker are decent quality and work well, all things considered. It doesn't really heat up unless you're really pushing it with some graphically-demanding games, as is the case for many phones. I have found that the battery life also is good. For casual use (texting semi-regularly, making some calls, some casual games and browsing the internet) it has consistently lasted a full day on a single charge for me. If I am doing more with it (playing more graphically-demanding games/ taking lots of pictures or video on top of what I mentioned before), then I might need to recharge it at some point during the mid-afternoon. It does charge pretty quickly. Couple things to note that aren't inherently negatives, but are maybe different from the mainstream phones you might be used to. - The light. It has a light that lights up for notifications and when charging (which is pretty standard) but this light is pretty bright compared to more mainstream phone lights. If you're a light-sensitive sleeper (like me) it's probably better to charge it away from your bed at night, or simply put it face-down. - The sounds. The sounds for notifications or getting a call are different and perhaps a bit more jarring. I don't really mind because I've always kept my phones on vibrate, but if you're a sound person that could take some getting used to. - The battery saver mode. The battery saver mode itself works well, but it does turn the interface where the home/back buttons are a bright, jarring red. This caught me by surprise the first time I turned it on. Luckily, the battery life is good enough where you won't need to turn on battery-saver often, but this is something to be aware of. Overall, this a good, sleek, modern phone that works well and can handle most of anything you have to throw at it, even if it is a bit quirky.",1,"Xiaomi"

"470","B07G8VPHG3",5,"true","Huge step up from the Mi A1, in a few ways. The most noticeable is absolutely the camera. I am a huge sucker for a good phone camera, but I am not looking to spend $900+ on a newer big name brand phone. This does the job and exceeds all expectations. The portrait mode is both front and back camera on this phone, and unlike the Mi A1, it does not zoom in on it's own for protrait mode which I found an annoying feature. The portrait mode is much cleaner and doesn't oddly smooth people's skin when you use portrait mode. Another thing I found annoying with the Mi A1 (I did however love that phone and used it for almost a year, until it sadly fell in the toilet. It didn't recover well.) This phone is sleek, responsive, includes updates and it is easy to restore everything from your previous phone. It came with a free clear phone case, and a charger. I bought this mostly because I loved the Mi A1 and I knew it delivered amazing photos, this however tops it. Camera is a huge deal for me, since I don't use any other way to photograph my children. And the Google photos app that comes with the phone is perfect for storing pictures. And printing out photos is crisp and holds true to the quality. My brother actually has a Samsung Galaxy s8 and I prefer this phone and it's camera to his. Sound is very good, loud and clear. If you buy this in hopes of a good camera, you won't be disap. It is easily comparable to the newer iPhone and the newer Galaxy phone, in function and in the camera.",21,"Xiaomi"

"484","B07G8VPHG3",5,"true","I watched a review of this phone on YouTube. I couldn't believe for the low price, all the features that came with this phone. For the price of this phone, it's loaded with features that a $500 Android phone would normally come with. The 4000ma battery last me two days. Amazing battery life. It comes with the Android one, Android 9 Pie OS. The minute I turned the phone on I got the latest update. It's a stock Android phone, but that's what I like about it. I don't need all the fancy bells and whistles that the high-end phones come with. And I'm sick of paying the high prices for phones that are outdated in a few years!. So it's nice to purchase a phone under $200, that has the processing speed, RAM and storage this phone has. Had this phone about 3 weeks and I'm very impressed. Feels and operates like a high-end phone. Very quick and responsive. 625 Qualcore Snapdragon processor. The only issue I may have with the phone, and it's a minor one to me, is the speaker. The speaker is very loud if you turned it up and extremely clear, so you can hear everything that's being said. But the quality of the speaker could be better for some people I'm sure. I do listen to a lot of music with the speaker, but when I plug the headphones in, a whole different story. Even has a built-in app to adjust the headphone features to great stereo sound. The Dual Camera's take great pictures! Xiaomi A2 Lite is sold all over China, India, and Asia, so that show's a demand for this phone. I read the owner of the MI company that makes the Xiaomi A2 Lite, wanted to make an affordable Android phone with high end features for everyone! He did!",1,"Xiaomi"

I agree that the fingerprint reader can be finicky and I am not sure if my IR scanner is working anymore. ON my 1st phone, IR worked for a couple months then seemed to stop. This new one, I cannot get it to work. I have to do some tests on other devices to verify. Other than that, I think this is a good phone with good battery life especially when you turn off the bluetooth, the wifi, and gps. The processor is plenty fast for most applications and it has good speakers. Hell it has a radio receiver although the receiver is not the strongest. It is not a perfect phone.

Bright, crisp screen, loud speaker, powerful processor to handle casual gaming, photo editing, and social media/browsing. Both cameras are great! Both front and back cameras do ‚Äúportrait mode‚Äù with high quality results, perfect for sharing online via FB/IG/etc. I also updated to Android Pie 9.0 and was happily surprised at the new gestures feature. It minimized the navigation bar to a flat bar and a small back button so you can swip up and get more screen realstate. I like to use Nova Launcher which helps hide the dock and the screen is just humongous now. So super happy with the phone! I use it with Mint Mobile and although the signal is not the best inside big buildings, it works just fine everywhere else. Thank you Amazon for always delivering so quickly!

Old review: After 4 years with a gs5, this was an incredible upgrade. So smooth and fast and every modern app runs flawlessly. The notch isn't as bad as you would think. The screen is plenty large between chin and notch. The one con worth mentioning is the Android one os. It's super smooth, very fast, no bloat, but omits tiny things I miss. For example, there's no way for battery percent to display instead of just the symbol. Little things are weird, but I still love it. The fingerprint sensor is fast and convenient, much more than facial recognition or a pin, but all those options are there. The battery is 2 days worth of use, easily.

People have complained about the rear mounted speaker and that the rear of the phone is made of plastic, but neither of these have proven to be troublesome just yet. It helps if you get a case, too. The screen is decent, nothing special but it won't be an eyesore for the vast majority of people. MIUI also allows you to set color temperature, which is a nice feature I wish was built in to more phones. This is so good. The only complaint I have in regards to the screen is that the aspect ratio does make the phone feel a little long and makes pressing buttons towards the top of the phone a bit of a chore. The camera is acceptable, nothing special but it gets the job done. I do recommend keeping the glass in front of the lenses clean, as there has been noticeable streaking in some pictures I've taken with it. Otherwise, it's not bad, but don't expect to win any photography awards with it, especially in low light. Overall, I can't find much wrong with this phone, especially for the price. One thing I will say is that you need to be careful when purchasing accessories for this phone, as I've already had one instance of ordering something that was listed as being for this phone that was actually made for another.

It stands up just fine and it even comes with a cool pen. The only issue with this is tat the pen is pink. I would have preferred it to match toe color of the case, but it is whatever. At the end of the day I believe it will get the job done and protect the phone. I just got it so I will have to see. It is only 10$ so I think it is worth it's price. Now I wonder what a more expensive case would look and feel like? Also these photos of the product does lie. It is simple. The numbers on the front was just a sticker, and the plus and minus signs on the sign are not even on the product. With all honesty they would probably be useless in the end so here was never a point of it being there anyways. The product is alright for it's pricing.

"543","B07G8VPHG3",5,"false","I will be reviewing this phone and making comparisons to the Samsung S5 which I am upgrading. I will also mention Mi A2 non-Lite version as well as LG phones. I usually upgrade when I feel like I can get a decent upgrade for $195 or less. This turned out to be a bit of an upgrade from the S5 with some notable trade-offs. This phone was recently introduced to Europe in July 2018, so I had to order it internationally to get one. My main reason for choosing this phone is that it had similar, but better specs than my old S5, and is one of the few phones around that retains my coveted IR Blaster AND sd card expansion. Requiring those features, significantly narrowed my options, however, in the end, I feel like this would have been a great choice either way. The price and features of this phone are AMAZING. I did buy a SquareTrade warranty to cover my back, just in case the phone turned out to be a problem. But after 2 months I have NO complaints. I chose the Lite over the non-Lite version, though I would have preferred the larger screen, it comes with a 20% SMALLER battery?? Very odd design choice. However, compared to the S5, I thought I was still getting a larger screen, I was somewhat incorrect. On the rare occasions where I am watching full screen video, it does seem to have a bigger picture than the S5. But in daily use, where the control bar and the notch are fully active, it is about the same size as the S5. Speaking of the screen, The display brightness of the S5 is much better, However having said that, I really do not have any complaint about the screen brightness or clarity of the Xiaomi unit. The battery life of the 4000mah battery seems to be amazing, I usually get 2 full days of use on a charge which includes listening to tuneIn 3hrs a day M-F. Loading antivirus caused a notable hit to battery life, otherwise I would have gotten 2.5 days. I am not a fan of disposable phones with non-removable batteries, so this was a huge leap out of my comfort zone to make this big purchase knowing it will be a paperweight in 2 years, but so far, it seems ok. Performance-wise the xiaomi Lite 64GB gave me double the RAM of my S5 and an octo-core CPU. The reason I prefer this Octo-core CPU to others is that it is a TRUE octo-core. Many phones try to Dupe you with the octo-core feature, actually providing you with 2 quad-core chips...a quad-core for hi-perf and a quad-core for lo-power usage. That whole idea just seems useless. This has an octo-core that RUNS AS AN octo-core at all times according to my research. Yeah, it uses more power, but I am all about more power when I still get 2 days of use on a charge...HURT ME! The SD/dual-sim combo slot is NOT an issue for me. When I want to change SIM, I just change the Sim and pop the alternate into the slot on my phone case for storage. No problemo. Another important aspect of any phone is its ruggedness. I do construction work. So far, I have managed to drop this phone twice on a tile floor (without a case) and not broken the gorilla glass. Also I have stored it in my pocket when my jeans were totally soaked with sweat and it still works. These were some of my biggest concerns, buying a brand that I didn't know, and a phone that is not promoted to be water resistant like the S5. I am thankful that the phone has shown itself to be quite resilient. This is where LG phones COMPLETELY FAIL and I'll never buy another LG, LG are garbage for rugged use. As far as the Vanilla Android, and the upgrade to Android 8.1, Ouch, that has been a 'Uge adjustment. Samsung included a lot of useful apps that I did not realize were Add-Ons! I had to download a flashlight, an alarm clock (samsung still has best Alarm clock IMHO), a photo gallery, a dialer, a keyboard! Gboard is USELESS. and a Texting app (Textra). This took about a week to try apps and get something usable. Lots of useless apps, as we all know. Then I had to load the LATEST version of the Apps from S5....BUMMER. Note, I always DISABLE UPDATES on my phones and PCs. I absolutely HATE opening a program where the interface and controls have TOTALLY changed from Yesterday! Ahhhhhg!...usually for the worse...""Change for the sake of change"" as they say. Just another exercise in frustration. ES explorer and TuneIn interfaces are now busy and cumbersome to use...that's progress?? At least Jota is the same. FYI, I don't even use the fingerprint scanner and don't care at all about facial recog and other unreliable bells and whistles that you pay $500+ for to be trendy. This phone has all the features I wanted and more for a pittance. Plus it seems to also be a high quality device. OVERALL, I HIGHLY recommend this phone, even though it's not perfect and not as large as I had hoped.",16,"Xiaomi"
"544","B07G8VPHG3",1,"false","We bought two of these phones directly from Xiaomi and had them shipped from China. We loved them while they worked. One phone developed a problem where the screen went blank whenever a call was answered and stayed blank for hours. The other one developed an intermittent problem with low volume on the microphones. Both phones became useless for these reasons. Then we discovered that Xiaomi tech support wasn't very helpful. They had us download a firmware update that was older than the one we already had. They asked us to use the phones built-in diagnostic software and make a video of the test. The test they asked us to run (""TOP MIC"") could not be found in the software on our phone, so we ran the two tests that we did find, each of which returned the ""FAILED"" response. But Xiaomi tech support declared that videos showed that the tests were successful! We asked if we could send them back at our expense to have them repaired, and they declined. They suggested we find a local phone repair shop and said that they might pay for the repairs if they found the charges reasonable.",2,"Xiaomi"

I live in California in the USA and while our earthquakes have never been anywhere near the worst in our world, the ever present flow of electromagnetic energy from our land has ALWAYS been a circuit killer of mass genocidal variety. That said... The battery maybe MUCH BETTER than how I have been experiencing it, and it is without question the best battery life I have currently ever experienced with a electrical device despite it's overheating issues for me. (Including some emergency equipment I have been comparing it to like my mother's breathing device's) Not to mention that just the other day we had another surge around here that this time was bad enough to take out the professional standard protector for my computer and any accompanying devices. Sadly while I did loose my Laptop alongside several other things I had recently gotten from Amazon here there was at least one currently attached device to said protector that is still working...

After several months of use, I can say I'm very satisfied with the performance of this unit. The battery life is excellent, it works with Android Auto in my car, the camera is decent, and the phone is fast thanks to the 4Gb of RAM and the mid-range 8-core processor. Best of all, it's Android One, so it has been receiving monthly security updates, and was automatically updated to Android P. Even under all-day use, it's rarely below 60% battery at the end of the day, thanks to the massive 4000mAh battery. The fingerprint reader works consistently and reliably. Oddly, even though this isn't an OLED screen, I have very little difficulty seeing it at any rotational angle when wearing polarized sunglasses, which is unusual for an IPS screen. If I have any quibble at all, it's that it doesn't support NFC. Overall, I'm very pleased with this phone, and would recommend it, especially at this price point.",3,"Xiaomi"

Reason being is that it doesn't support band 66 which in my area of Florida that's what is used near highways so I got dropped calls a lot as well as Pandora would stop constantly.

I have since rooted the device and run a custom ROM (Lineage OS) which is a much cleaner experience for me. I've seen reviewers complain about ads on this phone (as part of MIUI). I can verify that is the case. But it seems to be only in the settings screens and it's Xiomi advertising their products. Otherwise not actually intrusive. Just a little strange when you first notice it. Of course in my case this no longer matters since I changed the OS altogether. :) If you want a phone with great specs that'll run great and handle everyday use, runs games just fine etc., and don't want to break the bank... as long as you're not chasing the latest and greatest, this is a great option.",1,"Xiaomi"

The battery lasts for about 2 days with normal use, and for a few hours playing Ark online with the screen brightness up all the way. The quick charger has a European plug, but comes with a U.S. adapter, and it charges from zero to 100% in under an hour. Before I bought it, I read reviews that claimed there were full screen ads popping up. That's because when you do the initial new device setup, there is a check box that asks if you want to see ads.

Setup was so easy, all I had to do was touch my old phone and the new one together and everything automatically transferred to the new phone via NFC. If your old phone doesn't have NFC you can use the Google app called ""Files""and it will transfer everything from the old phone to the new one! Such an Easy process! After applying the easy update the phone operating system is now at the latest version of Android 9.0. I can not believe how good good the battery life is on this phone. Easily two work days of use on one charge. The phone arrived faster than what was promised and its everything I thought it would be. By the way. the camera is extremely fantastic with many many options such as portrait mode, Nighttime setting, Slow Motion video etc. If you have ever owned a Samsung phone, the theming options are very similar to what Samsung offers.

I'm not a big camera person but the photos do look pretty good even when zoomed in. Charging the phone did not take long at all when I used a quick charger 3.0, but the phone does support quick charging 4.0. The reception for me in my area is great, I'm on metro and get band 2 or 12 most of the time. The only time I have issues are at work but I am in an area that's basically a building inside a building. Also you can use the internet while on the phone with the 4g network.

I eould keek this phone IF it were truly unlocked. I agreed with the review, great hardware poor software. I want to add to this, the reason the software is poor is because it is NOT UNLOCKED. I am undeceided sbout returning it just for that reason. Maybe the definition of UNLOCKED has been redefined, unlocked not being tied to a carrier; but still locked into Mi where everything (all) information goes to Mi.

I have used the phone in the US and overseas (Asia), without issues and I found that with the same carrier, it was a bit more reliable than my daily driver in the US (Pixel 3).

"617","B07GPNGWNK",5,"true","First off, this phone feels amazing in the hand. The screen, though with a notch, is out of this world compared with older phones without OLED. Battery Life: Amazed me, my previous phone I needed to carry a battery band with me. But this phone lasted over 18 hours with lots of YouTube and Supercell games, along with general use. The quick charge capabilities are also very nice, but do note there is no wireless charging. Value: The value is out of this world when compared to other flagships from companies like LG, Samsung, or Google. It still lags just a little behind their own phone, the Pocophone F1, but as I am a T-Mobile user this phones band coverage worked for me. Notes: Make sure to check with your carrier to see what bands they support and compare with the bands this phone supports. Also the MIUI, though nice for simple users, is a kick in the face for power users. It is full of useless features that hinder the otherwise clean experience of the phone. I would recommend flashing a new version of android, something like Lineage OS, onto this thing. LinusTechTips made a great video on how to do this titled, ""The Ultimate Pixel 3 KILLER"".

It's very fast, the camera is really good (for a $300 phone), the battery lasts me the whole day, is has the latest version of Android (Android Pie), and it has a headphone jack and a micro sd slot!! Some of the things I didn't like were the stock launcher and the apps that came pre-installed on the phone. I had to download a third-party app to make my experience better, which is normally what I do with Android phones anyway, and had to manually disable/uninstall whatever pre-installed apps I didn't find useful. Another concern I had with the phone was the bands it had for LTE connectivity. I read online that it would really be hard to get LTE here in the US because it doesn't support the LTE bands that the USA uses.

The phone works even better than with the stock OS where that was even impressive. A special note on this phone - it uses specific bands for 3G and up so make sure that your wireless provider supports those specific bands - it's a bit unusual for the USA.

"692","B07H41NB46",5,"true","My comprehensive review: I do a lot of research before I buy a phone, mostly in the budget phone market. This phone has all the specs, speed and camera quality I could have asked for and with a 4000 mAh battery I rarely get to the end of the day with less than 20% battery life (as long as I don't leave the screen brightness cranked up) I have put this phone through a lot. I took it sledding and it bent a little but still works months later. I've dropped it countless times and though the screen cracked and a separate time I accidentally stepped on it face down on the cement, it still works - the screen is still sensitive and it's as fast as it was. If you are clumsy like me I do recommend a screen protector, case and one of those rings that attaches to the back. It has accidentally gotten a little wet a few times but with no negative consequences. The charging is fast with the Type C. The fingerprint sensor is quick. The speakers are average. It has a wild amount of space (128GB), I haven't had to delete any apps or pictures since I got it. I'm on Cricket and live in Omaha and don't get more than 4G most of the time (which honestly isn't that slow), but I traveled to the middle of South Dakota and had LTE. It occasionally struggles in the school I work at because of all the thick walls, but I've had that problem with my other phones.

The performance of the phone is great, picture quality, speed, display, storage etc is all great! DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE GETTING THIS PHONE. 4G LTE works only with AT&T. You cannot stream Amazon videos, Netflix, or Spotify on this device. None of those I do so it doesn't effect me.

The battery life is outstanding, especially compared to my last phone. Facial recognition works if you switch the region to India. I don't use it, but I did it to see if it worked. I had a S7 so the camera is an upgrade from that, I don't have a lot of other things to compare it to.

"701","B07H41NB46",5,"true","I'm always looking to do better than "" you get what you pay for "" and i usually end up disappointed. Not this time. This really is a $500 or $600 phone for only $300. I was never really happy with the performance of my LG V20 (snapdragon 820) in that it didn't open programs as quickly or play games as smoothly as i was expecting it to when i upgraded from a budget phone (snapdragon 430 4gb ram) about 8 months ago. I know, I know, the V20 came out in 2016 but i can't afford flagship phone prices so i waited for the price to drop heavily and found a brand now one for a little over $300. The jump in performance with this Poco f1 and its snapdragon 845 and 6gb ram is better than the improvement I got leaving my budget phone for the V20. If a game took 20 to 25 seconds to open and load on the V20 it takes 8 to 12 seconds on the Poco. Google Maps, Google Earth and any other processor demanding apps like VR happen pretty much instantly. Where as the V20 would stutter and freeze and get pretty warm and the battery would drain rapidly under heavy load the Poco doesn't even break a sweat. As for the OS that Xiaomi sticks on top of andriod that you read so many people complain about; just ignore them. The differences between it and stock android will require very little adjusting by the User and the added features are smartly thought out and welcome. I'll close with just one of many examples of the quality and performance of this phone by saying that I was sure that in terms of music quality I would be taking a step down because of the V20's highly cited 4 x DAC and all the hype that came with it. Wrong!!! The speaker phone is louder, and most importantly to me, the headphone performance is excellent. Its actually measurably better than the V 20 and 3 to 4 times the # of user adjust-ability options to make the most of it. I no longer even bother with connecting my headphone amp because its really that good all on its own. I was not expecting that at all!!! Of course if your phone company isn't using the radio bands this phone is made for then that is a major problem but in San Diego on the Cricket wireless network I get LTE and 4G nearly all the time and nothing less than 4G at anytime. If your area carrier supports this phone then I highly recommend it. Best Value to $$$ on the market by far and better than my highest hopes going in. I hope this review helps.",NA,"Xiaomi"

Did I mention the new Snapdragon 845 that this premium phones have is in this phone. Throwing My top games and this chip barely flinches. At this price like what else do u even need from a phone? Screen looks Crispy clear. Only Test I need to do is Signal Wize but that can't be fair since carriers are inconsistent with signal so I'll leave that to experts to rate. Anyways why wasn't so much money on a phone that's only going to last u like 2 years top. People have not realized that Battery lifespan is on average tops 2years. All phones cannot have the battery replaced by the user unless you have super phone powers and know what you are doing. So in two years you need a new phone so why pay 3 times what u already have. Until phones can have their batteries swapped by user don't care how long a phone is going to last since all phone now have a ticking time limit based on the battery. Quick math 1000$ at 2 years phones drop to about 450$ take in the insurance you are paying for an additional 360$ plus the deductible for having your phone serviced for a new battery u are left at this price point of the phone worth 350 or less.

Then a few day later an e-mail tell me the phone was fixed and on its way back to me. Then another e-mail asking me for password information which I did not have because I had set up a finger print scan when I set the phone up. I replied that I could not sent them the information they wanted. I talked to a SquarTrade individual again about this. He sent me an e-mail telling me I could speak with him just reply to his e-mail with a time and phone number for him to call. He did not return the call. I received another e-mail telling me the phone was repaired and on the way back to me. Yesterday the package arrived, my wife signed for it. Today I opened the box and looked at the phone and it was in the same condition as when I sent it to them. I called SquareTrade and they said it was a software issue and are refunding the cost of the SquareTrade policy. I'm furious and have no where to turn to.

After The puchased a T-Mobil direct plan, I was told by T-Mobil tech support that they no longer let phones with the numbers on both of my SIM cards connect to T-Mobil. (I presume the translates, if you buy a Pocophone F1 in the US, it can not be used for texting or for cellular data or voice.) This week, I have been into Target (where Consumer Cellular in person tech support is) five times and six times to the local T-Mobil store. Knew upfront that this would not work on either Verizon or Sprint, but apparently now, it also does not work on T-Mobil either. I also tried the AAT SIM card from my husband‚Äôs phone, with only very limited success. Did get a few minutes of 2G, but that too was fleeting. I have two-step verification on most of my on-line accounts. At this point in time, if a code arrived at all, it arrived 10 minutes late. THE POCOPHONE DOES NOT WORK ON ANY CELLULAR NETWORK IN THE USA. If you want a an updated Android version of an I-Pad Mini to use with Wi-Fi only, this is a very good deal: it just does not make or receive calls. Since we travel internationally I might just keep this. If I do kept the Pocophone F1, I will need to buy a second simple stupid cell phone to make and receive calls and send and receive texts.

"782","B07H41NB46",4,"true","The phone has outstanding features. Blazing fast, great screen, long-lasting battery, ample memory space. But it has an intrusive, hard to negotiate OS, many unsolicited apps which are hard, if not impossible, to uninstall or even stop, and needs some tweaks that will demand you go on google or specialized forums to find out about. One example is the face recognition system. I read about the feature prior to buying the phone, but when I got it out of the box, could not find it anywhere. After reading some blogs, it was said I had to change the country to India or Honk-Kong in order to use it. I did it, it works amazingly ( even in the dark ) So, a brief list of pros and cons: Pros * When it comes to hardware, this is easily the best deal in the market, and most sites in the world agree with it * Great screen * Unbelievably fast. I had a moto g5 prior to this one, and there is no way to even start to compare. Throw anything at it, open as many windows as you want, and it will handle it easily. * Lots of RAM memory, 128gb of space * Excellent sound ( i love music and have a senheiser PXC 550 as main bluetooth headphone ) * Crystall clear call quality * Finger ID and Face Recognition, but once the face recog is on, you will never need the finger again * Battery life is unbelievable. I use it through the day, heavily, and get to the end of it with 50-55% battery * 18W charger, so you get 25% charge in less than half an hour * The cable that comes with feels cheap ane is short, so I bought some 3 feet ankers Cons * Annoying, intrusive OS. I was used to the almost pure Androids on the moto G line, and the MUI that comes with this phone is full of stuff you don't need, so much stuff is hard to find the things you actually need Overall, the phone is so fantastic that is worth the weird software, but I have to take one star because of it",4,"Xiaomi"

"804","B07H41NB46",4,"true","Ahh, the Pocophone. A $300 masterfully crafted piece of hardware polished with minimal and functional software. True to it's Specs, it performs like a six cylinder turbo. Water-cooled Flagship processor, 6gb of RAM, and a massive 128gb of storage. This easily compares to a $700+ Flagship phone. Sometimes I like to download the most graphically intensive game and play, just too bast in 60fps on my phone. This thing can probably handle PS3 graphics. They're out of this world. The physical feel I grew to like. Some reviews pointed out, some even bitterly, that it doesn't have the feel of a flagship. It's a combination of hardened plastic and glass. For he price point, it's very workable; it feels solid. You're really holding a phone. The software I was a little nervous about. I had come from a Samsung, where they thought everything through meticulously and thoroughly. What I found was the Pocophone was just as well thought out, if not better. Everything runs butter smooth, and all the features that makes everything easier and enjoyable are quietly hidden in the corner. They did a fantastic job, and it shows. Sadly there are downsides. Not just sacrifices that have to be made, but what feels like engineering shortcuts. The facial recognition doesn't work in the United States. (The thumbprinter works fluidly, so that makes up for it.) And the largest is the phone lacks the capability to transmit and receive a very specific widespread 4G frequency. This is very noticeable, and it's sad that Xioami over-looked it. It's at times unusable, and at times slow to the point of frustrating. I don't really go any where, but it's definitely an issue. The final note is the quality of the ports, where there's a major issue. When I received the phone, it had trouble charging. The cord had to be plugged in delicately and be left untouched in order for it to charge. At first, I thought this was a quark of USB-C, but alas, it's just the quality of the port. After four months of use, there's now an issue with the audio jack. I pulled a plug out [with no more force then you would any other cord] and heard a small click. Now the headphone jack is having issue; it, too, much be delicately placed, which can be extremely frustrating and almost makes listening to headphones impossible. Over all, this phone is mind bending. Absolutely astonishing beyond its price point. If it weren't for the audio jacks, it'd be the perfect phone. I can't wait for Pocophones next iteration, and hope Xiaomi pays more attention to it's state-side customers. - Written on my Pocophone F1",4,"Xiaomi"
"805","B07H41NB46",5,"true","I bought this phone in early 2019, so I've had the phone for almost one year now. previously I had a Samsung galaxy s7 and really liked that phone. I didn't want to spend 800 on a new phone so after looking for a while I decided on this guy. So glad that I did. I live in Alaska so I was worried about getting a good signal. Not even a problem at all. On AT&T I get lte pretty much everywhere I go. I love some key features this phone has, like the lightning fast fingerprint scanner, the large display, the notch for the camera, the positioning of buttons, the dual sim capability, the 4000 mah battery, the liquid cooling, the 845 processor, and the build quality of the phone. It's a great phone and Ill take it over a Samsung any day, however there are a few things that knock off a few points, these include; issues with customization, (custom notifications and vibrations don't always work). Scanner can ""forget"" your finger. I have to re enter my print every few months, not too big a deal though. Peak brightness is a little lower than optimal in bright daylight. Flashlight is virtually non existent. Some missing features such as nfc. A weird awkward chin at the bottom of the screen. So there are a couple things that I would change but for the price this is amazing. I've dropped it several Times and it isn't cracked and still works perfect. It's not slowing down after a year of use. Stil over 90 gb available. Out of 128, plus a 128 gig SD card means I'll never run out of storage. The phone doesn't get hot either like my Samsung did. Even playing pubg mobile and similar games it stays at a good temp and the battery lasts forever. I've gone 4 days without charging before and I've never ever ran the phone to 0% battery. This phone feels great in The hand and isn't too bulky or heavy. Overall this is the phone to get. Absolutely happy with it. I recommend pairing it with a spigen case. I've tried several cases and I prefer this one. I give this phone 5 stars easy and recommend it to anyone looking for a new phone.",1,"Xiaomi"

The texting on the phone is kinda rough as I have misclicked so many letters which I never had a problem with older Samsung phones. Overall the phone is ok it works just wish I didn't lose connection so much and have so many misclicks. Hope this was helpful!! Ps. This is the first review Ive ever done.... I think lol",6,"Xiaomi"
"820","B07H41NB46",4,"true","Read and watched endless reviews on this one. My decision was between the F1 and One 6T. Awesome battery life. Fairly snappy even with the MUI bloatwear. It's an overall good phone... However, in the US cell signal is spotty (ATT is really your only choice for moderate coverage). It's rare that I get 4G/LTE inside a building, even my own home. I live in Indianapolis, and still have spotty signal. For $300+ its a great phone. But when you actually hold it side by side with a premium phone... You know it's not a flagship killer. Also the MUI has a really quarky way about itself. After a while, I begin to miss my Galaxy phone... Lesser screen, limited adjustments of features in used before, and obviously the uncertainty of having service when needed. I don't miss the $800 price of the premium phones tho. Probably should have spent a few extra hundred dollars and got the One 6T, which will probably be happening here in the next month or two. Very good phone... I just don't love it.",12,"Xiaomi"
"821","B07H41NB46",5,"true","This may very well be the first review I have ever written in eight years of using Amazon...I know. That's bad. This phone made me feel the need to write a five-star review. This is a massive upgrade from my iPhone 6s, and it's less than half the price. I nearly got a one plus 6t, which I'm sure is a great phone, but I'm glad I didn't. This came out to about $300 less than I would have spent even on the 6t, which is supposed to be a ""flagship killer."" The thing is, I think this phone is comparable. I just opened this up today and have been playing around with it for a few hours, so I will have to see how it holds up over time. I am definitely optimistic. It is astounding that this was only $334. Really glad I came across a review of this phone on youtube.",8,"Xiaomi"

Absolutely unacceptable. I can't tell you how many times I've nearly chucked this glorified paperweight across the room out of frustration. If you live anywhere in North America? DO. NOT. BUY. Even if you only want to make calls and the occasional text, there are MUCH more budget friendly options out there. Not to mention the dodgy quality. I've never actually thrown my phone, but the screen will just randomly decide it's not going to register touch, and has started to randomly close apps on me.

"841","B07H7SBBWQ",5,"true","This is a pretty darn good phone. As someone who lived with a $50 bottom of the line ATT smart phone for too long, I must say that the Redmi 6 exceeds all my requirements. Screen is just fine in a small format that the phone is. Front and back camera's are quite good. The 4gig ram and 64 gig storage is a supper delight. Processor is fast enough. It works just fine on ATT. It updated to pie MiMU 10 within an hour of turning it on and it's just a nice phone. I am using Nova Launcher as an overlay and I disabled and or deleted as much of the included apps as I could. I did not create a Mi account either. I do like all the opinions that settings has. Far more then a typical att phone. Developer mode does work as well. With all my typical apps loaded I have 52+ gig's left in on board memory. Mind you I'm not a gamer so not super memory intensive. Charger was the India / EU charger but a usa 115 adapter was included. ALL in ALL, this is a great phone for a reasonable price. Very happy with it.",9,"Xiaomi"
"842","B07H7SBBWQ",5,"true","I have bad luck with smartphones. Either the phone I purchase doesn't fit my needs for one reason or another, or it somehow breaks within months of purchasing it. So far, the Redmi 6 has yet to live up to this on either front. It supports all the LTE bands I need, and it is a surprisingly durable phone for its price. I have managed to get water in this phone twice since I've owned it. Both times the phone would get stuck in a boot loop, but after awhile it would shrug it off and continue to work like nothing ever happened. I've verified full functionality with benchmarks and diagnostics, too, so this isn't just perception. You can also look up the video of this phone cracking walnuts with its screen if you need any more reassurance that this is not a phone that reflects its price tag. Additionally, if you are worried about GPU performance being lackluster, don't be. While the GPU benchmarks on this phone don't exactly impress, in practice it is more than enough to handle most things you can throw at it. PUBG Mobile on low settings runs mostly fine, with only occasional hiccups. The CPU is ahead of the curve in this price range, so keep that in mind, as well. Emulated Sega Saturn games in Yaba Sanshiro actually run better than they do on my Moto G6. MIUI is a mixed bag, admittedly. Thankfully, you can run your own launcher on top of it with negligible impact on performance. I use Nova Launcher to retain a stock-ish Android feel for the home screen and app drawer, but use MIUI for its highly customizable theme engine. The result is a phone that looks quite unlike any other, a huge plus if you're like me and like things to look sleek and orderly. You will have to spend some time to find a good enough theme, but once you do, you won't ever want to go back. Aa far as form factor and features go, again, this phone is better than you'd be led to believe. People have complained about the rear mounted speaker and that the rear of the phone is made of plastic, but neither of these have proven to be troublesome just yet. It helps if you get a case, too. The screen is decent, nothing special but it won't be an eyesore for the vast majority of people. MIUI also allows you to set color temperature, which is a nice feature I wish was built in to more phones. The only complaint I have in regards to the screen is that the aspect ratio does make the phone feel a little long and makes pressing buttons towards the top of the phone a bit of a chore. The camera is acceptable, nothing special but it gets the job done. I do recommend keeping the glass in front of the lenses clean, as there has been noticeable streaking in some pictures I've taken with it. Otherwise, it's not bad, but don't expect to win any photography awards with it, especially in low light. Overall, I can't find much wrong with this phone, especially for the price. One thing I will say is that you need to be careful when purchasing accessories for this phone, as I've already had one instance of ordering something that was listed as being for this phone that was actually made for another. Past that, I can't recommend this phone enough. Xiaomi has won a loyal customer.",17,"Xiaomi"

"908","B07HK4JNV1",5,"true","For this price point, it is an amazing deal. Xiaomi really has done it again. Really fast midrange processor , paired with MIUI provides a almost iPhone level of smoothness. Battery life is amazing, with a monster 4000 mAh battery, this phone easily lasts for two days of charge. SOT (Screen on time) is about 7-8 hours of normal usage before the battery drains, meaning I could use this phone for hours and hours. Amazingly, T-Mobile LTE works perfectly on this device, and as well as 3G. Call quality is great, tons of memory, and a great screen makes this phone an amazing deal. There is even an option to ""disable"" the notch if you really wanted. For gaming performance, this phone is an absolute beast. PUBG Mobile, a very graphics intensive game runs smoothly at medium settings with no frame drops. This phone's chip is well cooled, and it won't fry your hand when playing intensive games. The snapdragon chip in here absolutely destroys other MediaTek equipped devices, and stomps on the older SD625. Good ROM support and a unlocked bootloader makes it very easy to ROOT and Mod to your liking if that is your thing. All in all, unbeatable value for a phone of this price. Is actually better that most phones twice, or even three times its price.",138,"Xiaomi"

"911","B07HK4JNV1",5,"true","I've been dying to write a review on this phone. I've never been this happy about a phone. Ever. First of all, my previous phone is a Huawei Honor 5x. It's a decent phone, but because I'm a heavy user of social media, various apps, etc., it began to lag terribly over time. It was time to find a new phone, and I did a LOT of research before deciding on this one. First, aesthetics: This phone is beautiful. Mine is black and it has a sleek, expensive look. I love the shape of it, and it fits well in my small hands. My old Huawei looks so clunky next to it. I like that the app widgets are small, too. The screen is large and gorgeous. The phone also comes with a silicone case. Second, overall performance: This thing is FAST. The phone is very responsive, and I don't have to wait for a page to load, or to open apps. I'm in love with how streamlined it is, and how easy it is to figure out. I was looking at my mom's new Samsung J7 Crown the other day, and I didn't like its setup at all. It made me appreciate my Xiaomi even more. The battery life is awesome. With modest use throughout the day, I've often had more than 50%, even 70% at the end of the day. I also like that on the battery indicator it shows an actual number indicating the percentage of charge left. Third, camera: I haven't used the camera much, yet, but I love it so far. I love the time-lapse and slow-motion features, and was giddy when I discovered it even has tilt-shift! I'm an amateur photographer, and I've done many tilt-shift images by editing them in Photoshop. So this was a bonus. It also has a Portrait mode. I will tell you that the Portrait mode does not create a true portrait photo. It blurs the background of your subject, and it does a very good job of it. You may see a little blurring around the edge of your subject, which would not be present in a photo done with an actual camera. It is much the same as doing it in post-production in Photoshop or another program. Still, it's pretty cool. The overall photo and video quality is beautiful and sharp. I suggest to anyone who wants to use the zoom feature...don't. As with any phone with digital zoom, you will lose the sharpness of your photo any time you use digital zoom. If at all possible, take the photo of a far-off subject without the zoom, then crop it. This phone does a nice job of getting great detail from a distance, so once the photo is cropped, it will look much sharper than if it had been taken using the zoom feature. I also discovered, accidentally, that I can use the volume button to snap a photo, which is nice. The video quality, as well, is very nice. And you can snap photos while shooting video. It shoots in 1080p, and I've read that the Note 7 Pro that is coming out will shoot in 4K, but 1080p is nothing to sneeze at. I'll still be able to produce some nice videos for Instagram, etc. This phone has a gyroscope, so you can play Pokemon Go and other similar games with it very smoothly. However, I just started playing Jurassic World Alive, which is much like Pokemon Go, and I can't use the AR function within the game. The phone is not supported at this time. It may work with Pokemon Go, though I haven't tried it yet. It may be dependent on the app itself. The sound quality on this phone is great, too. I often use my Soul Emotion Bluetooth earbuds with it, and it's loud and clear. Even without them, the volume is really good and not at all tinny. I also discovered that this phone has an IR blaster, so I'm able to control my Roku smart tv and Samsung blueray player with it. I lost my blueray remote forever ago, so I was stoked to be able to use my phone to use all the functions. It was super easy to set up. I also can cast whatever I'm doing on my phone to my tv, so I've had some fun with that. I talk to my granddaughter via Facebook Messenger video chat, and sometimes I'll cast our session to the tv. If you don't know how to do it, just go to Settings, then More, then Wireless display, turn it on, and if your tv is connected to your wifi network, it will show up below. Just click on it and in a few seconds you'll have your phone's display on your tv. You can watch Facebook videos, look at photos on your phone, etc., if you want to. It's pretty neat. I haven't tried the Face Recognition or Fingerprint features yet, so I can't speak to how well they work. Oh, another nice little feature about this phone I love is the volume control. When you click on the button, the controls pop out from the right side of the phone and there are two separate buttons. The top one is to operate the volume for videos and such. The bottom button turns off the volume for notifications and ringtones. I love this because I can immediately silence them without having to go into another menu to turn down what I need to, one by one. This is great when I'm at work and forget to turn off notifications. I can do it at a touch of a button, and turn it on just as easily. Finally, I use Straight Talk, with a T-Mobile sim card. I've had no issues with calls or texting. However, I never talk on the phone, so I can't touch on whether there are issues with dropped calls or problems receiving or making calls. I've tested it a few times, and it worked just fine. As for texting, it works perfectly, and I can easily send photos and videos. I did have to get a new sim card because my old phone used a micro sim, whereas this phone uses a nano sim. I also was able to transfer all my apps that were stored on my 32gb SD card flawlessly to this phone. I think I've covered everything. At this price point, you can't beat the features and functionality of this phone. I needed more internal storage and ram, and with 64gb of internal storage and 4gb of ram, I know I won't have to worry about the lag I experienced with my previous phone. It only had 16gb of storage and 2gb of ram. That's fine for a casual user, but for me, it wasn't enough. I'm super happy with this phone. There are more expensive phones out there that don't offer all the features packed into this one. Get. This. Phone.",43,"Xiaomi"

"917","B07HK4JNV1",1,"false","When it come to comparing the RedMi, I use my old 2015 Moto X Pure as the standard. Jumping from that I found many things that do not get noted. 1. Screen Size - 19:9 6.2 in screen vs 16:9 5.7 in screen - one of the biggest disappointment and reason I bought the RedMi is that it said it had a larger screen size, but in regards to ppi the Moto X Pure has 117 more ppi which is 403 ppi vs 520 ppi. This means that the Moto X Pure an older phone had a higher resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels vs the 1080 x 2280 pixels. Because of the longer height, it is deceptive in saying it is a half inch longer in screen size, but you are losing out 3 mm in width. Also the notch is included which makes it deceptive. 2. App Issues - Not compatible with Google Fit and YouTube. The pedometer does not work with google fit and it doesn't record steps, you can you other apps like Nike Fit, but this is a no-no if you are planning to use adventure sync. YouTube mostly supports 16 X 9, meaning that videos you view will get black bars. It does have pinch zoom which fixes this issue a bit for some videos, but this means you might have difficulties with subtitles. 3. Spotty LTE Connection with T-Mobile. Going in I knew that the bands were limited, but there were times the connection would disconnect when driving and I could not get coverage. The fact that the Moto X Pure has both GSM and CDMA and I never had an issue with it's connection make it way better in coverage. 4. It run on the MIUI. Going from stock android to MIUI, you will have issues. These can be nitpick but a fair warning of user planning to buy, as it uses MIUI instead of stock android. This is big if you used to an OS with no bloatware. 5. Camera, yes it dual camera, but it is a 12 mp camera compared to the 21 mp camera for Moto X. My conclusion is that there are better budget flagships. If screen size is important to you I would consider another phone. If you want a phone that serves as a good mini computer, this works well with it's 4000 amp battery and large ram size.In regards to the camera, it does have intelligent AI and dual camera, but it skims and scrapes on certain places that make it show less value for the money.",15,"Xiaomi"

"922","B07HK4JNV1",5,"true","I live in the Seattle area and have Cricket (AT&T) unlimited service, that fact comes into play further on in the review. As a long-time iPhone user, I was ready to mix-it up a little and so was interested in this phone (4gb/64gb) model when I came across a review of it on Youtube. Bluntly, for the $, the phone is amazing. It puts my iPhone 6 to shame. I'm thrilled with the purchase, but point out my approvals / concerns in the following. * Storage: Get the 64gb model. Though there is an SD card, you will soon use the 32gb version on apps etc. The SD card option can be used for camera video, movies, and music, but not for installing apps. That 32gb goes pretty quickly. * Connectivity: Be aware that the wireless bands supported may limit your data speed - or kill it. For example, on my iPhone, with full US LTE channel support and Crickets Unlimited plan, I was getting 3mbps/6mbps (down/up). Using the Redmi Note 6, with only a single LTE channel support, I am getting 3mbps/0.5 (down/up). Which is fine as Netflix etc don't show a difference in quality. For video chat, I would imagine the 0.5mbps ""up"" could be an issue. Note: I've only had the phone a few days and so not tested it while driving to other areas etc. where it may improve/lessen my connectivity. * Camera: Before purchase, I watched videos on YouTube where the 6 Pro camera was recording in slo-mo at 720p and 120fps. Out the box, this is not accurate. The official slo-mo on this camera has no fps options and seems to be locked at 720p at 30fps - so not very good, my iPhone is much better. Perhaps the Youtubers knew of a 3rd party app as the camera seems like it can perform better fps. However, other camera functionality is good. The phone takes great photos overall, 1080p video (max 30fps), and the ""selfie"" mode has the cool feature where the background is blurred. The camera also has an ""AI"" mode, intended to be a one-stop setting where the camera switches scene settings, depending on its environment. Still not fully tested by me. * Battery: My iPhone 6 had great battery life, but the Redmi is even better. I played around installing apps, setting up my options, and testing Netflix etc, and still had 60% after hours of geeking around. * Other points: Seems to be working with my Fitbit Versa - which is very particular about ""supported phones"". Notifications work too on the Versa, but after some setting changes. All in all, a great value for money. Fast device with a ton of storage. I have all my apps installed, and the luxury of many that I don't really ""need"", and still have 40gb remaining. But the fly in the ointment is that cellular LTE support. What will happen when visiting other States or even towns? Will I keep acceptable coverage? To find out, watch this space. 2 WEEK UPDATE: No issues with connectivity after driving 30 mile radius of my home. School, airport, work, visiting trips all kept connectivity. Slower in places, but faster in others. More than enough for my needs of music streaming, maps, email, and calling. All worked great on ATT/Cricket.",10,"Xiaomi"

"927","B07HK4JNV1",4,"false","I have this phone for a few months now and I like it very much. The screen is big (my wife says it's a bit big for her, I can handle a bigger one), the capacity of the battery is fenomenal (4000mAh), the phone can be charged once every 2 days, but I don't like playing with my luck so i just charge it when it's about at 30% and I'm good for the next day (I don't charge over night to save the battery), the screen looks sharp (haven't used in VR yet, I will definitely try and update this review). Now for the bad ones: One of the most annoying things a phone company can do is mass with the audio levels, this is the exact case with the redmi note 6 pro, the audio is far too low! And it's unbearable at times. I use an Aux cable and at some cars I'm having difficulty hearing podcasts and the music volume is limited which ruins it completey, I tried to use apps to have a higher sound but didn't made it so far. The camera loading time is just terribly long beyond imagination, I'm trying to catch moments of my kids and I find myself exhaling of desperation at the phone waiting for it to load the camera already, I'm trying to use different apps, it may solve the problem.

"936","B07HK4JNV1",5,"true","The cost of smartphones in the US is absurd. When the family needed new smartphones I decided I wasn't paying 600 dollars or whatever for a phone from my carrier. I started looking online for refurbished phones and instead found the NEW Redmi Note plus 6 here on Amazon and it was cheaper than the refurbished samsung phones I found. I went to the T-Mobile store and the family got new phones with the exception of me. Since we were new to T-mobile they had to give me a new sim card so my banged up Galaxy S5 would work on their network. I found that I could make calls but get no data. Later I learned its probably because the Galaxy S5 doesnt use band 4. I did some research and found that the Redmi Note plus did support band 4 so I was becoming hopeful that I could use the Redmi on T-mobile. When my Redmi Note arrived I found that I needed a nano sim card as it wouldnt take the micro sim in the S5. I got my new nano sim from T-mobile, popped it in my Redmi Note 6 right in the T-mobile store and boom, it came right up, I got 4 bars and LTE! (see my screenshot). I was stoked! I've been using this for a few days now and so far I'm thrilled with this phone. I was a bit concerned about the display as the specs for this device would indicate that the display quality would not be as impressive as the flagship phones from samsung and motorola. Honestly though, I cant really tell the difference having seen these other phones. The display on the Redmi note 6 is bright and colors are vivid. It's also lightening fast and navigating the phone is buttery smooth. Battery life is phenomenal, however it doesn't charge as quickly as other phones but I honestly don't care about this. I work from home and if I go out for any length of time I expect a single charge will last me. The most notable difference I've found between this phone and comparable samsung or motorola phones is the firmware. MIUI is leaps and bounds better than any other Android ROM I've tried. It's super easy to use and extremely customizable. It doesnt have an app drawer though which was hard to get used to at first. I eventually just created a folder and started putting my apps in there. I realize you can use different launchers that use an app drawer but I didnt want to give up MIUI because honestly its that darn great. I won't go into much detail on why MIUI 10 is so impressive but there are plenty of videos on youtube that demonstrate it. This is also my first phone with a fingerprint scanner. My samsung galaxy 5 was supposed to be able to read fingerprints but it never worked very well and it was awkward to use. The fingerprint scanner on this phone however is amazing. I was really blown away at how fast and accurate it is. simply touching the scanner will unlock your phone. I realize that other phones have this feature but for a phone this big, with these specs to have a fingerprint scanner and at this price point is just amazing. Also, if you're on T-Mobile, you can get wi-fi calling to work. You just have to apply a dialer code (search for it on google). I have it enabled on my phone and it works fine. See the screenshot I added. On the downside, this phone doesnt have NFC which is that handy feature that lets you pay with things at the register with your phone. I don't really use that so its not that big of a deal to me but its something to think about if thats your thing. Also, the battery is non-removable. So if you need a new battery, you'll need a pro to have it replaced. EDIT: Well I loved this phone so much but unfortunately T-mobiles network is absolutely horrible and after numerous missed phone calls I was forced to switch back to Verizon. Unfortunately the Redmi note does not work on Verizon so I had to return the Redmi Note and it pained me to do so. Sure wish they made a dual band version of this terrific phone.",6,"Xiaomi"

They have sent me many eMails and were willing to take returns if needed, etc. So I can't say this enough, they're a very good company to purchase from. With that said, I mistakenly purchased this phone thinking it had Wi-Fi calling because someone put it in the comments. I have T-Mobile in the US and this does not have Wi-Fi calling for them. I even rooted the phone, altered the build.prop file, even had the toggle switch that normally isn't there, was only there because I altered file to make it appear. Long story short, after multiple hours of trouble shooting, doesn't work. Tested it with Airplane mode on, wifi on, no go. It's my fault. I listened to a Q&A answer, I should've contacted the seller. So if there is anything I can say about my experience.... Contact the seller about the phone before you purchase if there is any specific feature you're needing. So, this is an amazing phone for the price point. I got it for my Daughter because she had an old international Galaxy Note 5 that didn't support wifi calling. Someone wrote in the Q&A that this supports Wi-Fi Calling. I have T-Mobile and they absolutely support the feature, it's the phone that doesn't. In fact, there is a hidden menu in this phone and you can see the feature, but it won't let you click. You have to root the phone, change the code in build.prop and enable it that way..... too much work. It's going back.

Granted, everything has its pros and cons it is almost impossible to go wrong at this price point for what you get. Xiaomi has certainly won me over, even though I came from using the Samsung Galaxy Note series phones. This one just seems reasonable and you get more value for your money, compared to similar phones that want to mark up the price ridiculously. If you are on the fence wondering if this is a good option for you, I'd say it is for what you pay. Xiaomi just needs to focus on expanding into the US Market better and give more support for US cell bands. But other than that, this phone is superb.

Thank you 2019. üòÅ I use MetroPCS and this phone works great with the network after I called MetroPCS and swapped the esn. Miui doesn't have the best home screen because there is no app drawer. The themes are cool. But I ended up replacing it with Nova launcher. Other than that I feel like xiaomi's version of Android is nice and polished. However there's are ads in the built in apps and there is no way to easily disable them. I'm guessing that is what justifies xiaomi's low price on this phone. Budget or not, this is the phone to get.",2,"Xiaomi"

"992","B07HK4JNV1",4,"true","And it kicks ass! It's been a month now since I started using my RedMi Note 6 Pro. I'm a mere user so I cant say much about its specs except that this is my first cellphone with over 32gm ROM on board complemented with 4 gb of RAM. It feels dainty and luxurious for me, the color is not glaring but it is pretty (pink rose). The grip is firm and secure. It comes with a complimentary TPU casing with a mounted screen protector. With its about 4000mAmps of battery, it does not weigh as much. I have no intention of testing its resistance to shock, water or extreme temperature (I don't $200 to throw away), but I notice it is reasonably sturdy. As a phone it does not disappoint. The clarity is exceptional and the speaker phone is clear, delivering almost natural voice. The pre-installed apps can be annoying but as soon as I got a handle of them, I would say they work. If did not need them, I can turn them off. In the first weeks of use, I notice that it takes way more ads than my previous unit. But it also comes with an option in Settings to turn these ads off. So far, it's been quiet. The display is great to amazing and the cameras are good to very good. It increased my connectivity for portable hot-spot to less than a minute and the streaming have been way better than with my last phone. I'm new to cellphone gaming and I downloaded through its hot-spot capability some games like Shadow Fight 3, Modern Combat 5, Mobile Legends BangBang, Highway Sniper, Epic War, and Modern Warplanes. They all seem flow through seamlessly, even while running its portable hotspot and opened a couple of URLs at the background. To top all these, and other running apps, I am using the Total Launcher - Star Trek Interphase as theme for this phone, a rather beautiful but top-heavy mobile theme. Its battery life is good. I don't normally use my phone a lot at work, but when I need to log-in to my classes, I use Redmi's portable hotspot fairly through the day. I work on flexi-time as a counselor, and often, I get to work around 830 and be home around 8 or 9pm. I may be wiped out but the phone has at least 25-35% power remaining. I dont charge it straight instead intermittently, keen on keeping at least about 90% power available before I report to work. XiaoMi's RedM Note 6 pro is an excellent product. I'm planning to get my wife and my kids the same if not the more recently updated version of the phone. My Xiaolin is better than I thought it is going to be.",1,"Xiaomi"

"1007","B07HK4JNV1",1,"true","Recently broke my Moto G5 plus and replaced it with this, mostly pretty happy. Wish the LED indicator was colored. I find the notch a bit annoying because it limits the notification indicators. The battery display is great and the screen itself is really pretty. The battery lasts through my 12 hour shift just fine. I don't know if it's my new network or if the antenna is worse but I don't get service inside the warehouse like my old phone did. I recommend changing the launcher if you don't like a cluttered home screen since the default doesn't have an app drawer. Edit after a few weeks: The phone often ""forgets"" how to use mobile data. Turning off data and turning it back on doesn't even work. I have to fully restart the phone. It is a pain in the butt when I just wanna quickly look something up. Last week the audio randomly stopped working for no reason until a restart. It often has a second of two of delay before the screen turns on when you press the button. I do not recommend buying this phone. It is full of minor quirks and your money can be better spent elsewhere. update: After two months it completely broke and won't turn on.

"1021","B07HK4JNV1",5,"true","this review comes after six months of use. i like the dual selfie and rear cams. pic quality is great for this price point. dual SIMs is great for me as I need texts from offshore, as is the option to slot in a SD memory card. iam using it on T-mobile and i get bands 4 and 5. No band 12 which limits my coverage range esp. in outer or older suburbs, else I would have used this as my main phone. If Xiaomi phones have a drawback it is the limited LTE bands available. Get a sturdy case n screen protector for your Xiaomis coz it is what it is. It is less likely to survive everyday drops. The free stock case that comes with it is useless and protects from scratches only. a good feature of Xiaomi MIUI android layer is the Second Space function, which sets up a separate partition with its own login and apps, good if you are giving this phone to your kid to use. you may even grow to like the MIUI system apps and use them over Google apps There's an infra red on this phone so you can use it as a TV remote and a HEADPHONE JACK that delivers decent quality sound.",1,"Xiaomi"

"1086","B07HK4JNV1",3,"true","I bought this phone in April. I was very excited to receive this given the good specs about the phone. Initially it was a great phone. It was super fast, lightweight, great camera! But after using it for 6 months there is one big problem I must warn about: Screen Burn In. It's the annoying, just by booting up the logo gets burnt in on the screen. Anything with a remote bit of white in it gets burnt in after like 2-3 or so minutes of use. It's gotten much slower and that's at 1.9-2.4 gigs of 4 gigs of RAM. A majority of internal storage is left. I clean the junk with the built in cleaner but the phone speed goes back to being slow after like 10 minutes. The battery life has begun to decrease drastically. Initially it took like an hr to decrease by 10% now it takes 15 to 20 mins of use. The camera isn't too crisp or sharp, when I zoom in on images for details...not even all the way zoomed in at that, the pic is super fuzzy. It's a good phone but I think it would be great if these small issues were fixed.",NA,"Xiaomi"

"1107","B07HK4JNV1",3,"true","At this point, the Redmi Note 6 has been surpassed by the 7, and probably will be eclipsed before too much longer by the 8, but if anyone is thinking about going with this discount option, here are my thoughts. First, the pros - it's a decent phone for the price. Uh, that's about it, sadly... it's not going to win any awards for speediness or amazing display or features. It's acceptable, but not amazing. Honestly, I'm kind of disappointed in the experience from this phone. I wasn't expecting something top-of-the-line, just a modest upgrade from my previous phone (a Galaxy S5 - yes, you read that right, an S5 - I had that thing for-ev-er). In battery terms and processor, it's definitely a step up from the Galaxy - as you would expect a phone that is, what, three years younger? Four? And the battery certainly isn't anything to scoff at - 4000mAh is ridiculous. Or, at least, that's how it seemed to me, coming from a 3000mAh battery. After six months, though, I was not feeling the love as much - the battery has been losing performance since month 3, despite not doing MORE with the phone. Then there's the MIUI - can I just say how much I hate branded UIs? All the bloatware and custom circuits to get around the OS are obnoxious, and this is one of the more irritating experiences I've had on an Android phone. I *STILL* can't find some of the standard menu options that come with Android, and it's REALLY annoying having to tell MIUI Messaging every week or so that I DON'T want an MIUI account to take advantage of the in-community messaging system. Then there's the questionable security policy - after 72 hours, you HAVE to use your PIN to unlock the phone. Not a terrible idea, really, except when the phone gets it in its tiny mind that your PIN ISN'T what you think it is. Then you have to restart the entire phone and pray that the phone realizes it was mistaken (so far, it's happened several times and each time it's realized, ""OH, You meant THAT?! Sorry, my bad..."" but I worry that some day it will become obstinant). Finally, there's the biggest disappointment for me - durability. I don't abuse my phones (the fact that I had an S5 for YEARS should speak to that), but they fall out of pockets periodically when sitting down, or bump against things. I've had my RedMi in a case since day one, under a screen shield. And yet, within three months, the camera glass cover was seriously cracked, and within another three it was broken through so that the camera is next to useless (though it's a nice feature for those who benefit from generous ""soft focus"", like yours-truly). This is in part (in my estimation, at least) by the fact that the camera glass protrudes at least a millimeter beyond the back of the case. A millimeter isn't much, but when the entire phone is under 10mm thick... The screen hasn't been damaged, thankfully, but if it had managed to take a hit through a generous case AND a screen protector, I'd have serious doubts: either to my own grace, or to the quality of the glass, I'm not sure which. All of this said, it's not a horrible phone. I just had expected a little more - not as brittle, not as bloated with the on-brand UI. But hey - at least it still has an IR blaster (which is one of the key things I'd been looking for in a phone).",NA,"Xiaomi"
"1108","B07HK4JNV1",5,"true","The phone is just awesome. The wonders that MI has done with this phone is just awesome. But I've been facing a little issue with this phone. I bought this one for my wife and when I call her, 1/10 times the call just wouldn't go through (Carrier provider is T-MOBILE). It shows in my phone it's ringing but she doesn't receive it. So there are some network issues with MI and all other Xiaomi phones too. I had MI note 3 before and had this issue with that too. But overall, it's worth the price",4,"Xiaomi"

"1160","B07HK4JNV1",1,"true","Overall the build quality of the phone is cheap, not much of a surprise but some things to look out for; the glass scratches too easily, mine has marks from being dropped on a skateboard. The chassis is plastic and will flex in your hand. Even the vibration motor FEELS CHEAP. There are far better phones for the same amount of money. The camera quality is piss poor, having 4 cameras doesn't make for better pictures, especially when 2 of them are dormant and useless outside the camera app. selfies are blurry, and colors are off balance. unless the phone is completely still on a clear, sunny day, the picture quality is just garbage. They turn out blurry and unclear. and color reproduction is far off key. I can't express just how bad the camera is on this phone, among the worst I've used. Here comes the icing on the cake, after becoming extremely frustrated with the amount of ads in the UI I tried to unlock it to install my own ROM which would allow me to have control over the phone. Everytime you install an app, ADVERTISEMENT. everytime you open a system app, ADVERTISEMENT . They're EVERYWHERE in the UI and it's absolutely ABSURD and frankly OFFENSIVE. Rooting the phone would solve the problem of the Advertisements everywhere, however Xiaomi requires you to create an account on their forums, with your EMAIL and PHONE NUMBER, where you can ASK to unlock it. Absolutely unacceptable considering Android is open source software. If that isn't enough, you're required to be on a mobile network, not wifi, during the unlocking process. There's no reason for this as on all other non-Xiaomi devices can be unlocked without even being connected to the internet. THIS IS MY WORST GRIPE WITH THE PHONE AND IT CANNOT BE FIXED UNLESS XIAOMI DECIDES TO CHANGE THE UNLOCKING PROCESS OF THEIR PHONES. I can't express how frustrating this has become. I would never recommend this or any other Xiaomi device to anyone except my enemies.",9,"Xiaomi"

I've traveled around the city and I always have a 100% bars with my signal so far. My old phone rarely did. I believe I will be just fine with the service bands it uses here and across seas when I travel. When the phone was delivered it had a 66% charge so I immediately paired it with my old phone and left it on the table alone while it transferred everything over, apps, accounts, phone calls, and text. It took around 15 minutes or less. I had the phone ready to go minus personal setup preferences in no time. The camera is absolutely the best I have had and can be opened up to do more than intended at this price point. The battery will last all day! I left the house at 8am and used it constantly through out the day for work. It's 6pm with 62% charge with no additional charge and screen display brightness at about 70%. AUTO display brightness is always to dark for me, no matter the setting. The battery may never ever need charging again at that setting....... but I'll never test that out though. Fingerprint reader works great. It keeps excellent Wifi connections. The screen looks great and the camera notch revealed doesn't bother me like I thought it would. Nothing I do slows down the phone. It would have been an absolute waste for me to buy anything more. With the rubber black cover that came with the phone it feels solid in my hand. At $175 my bank account loves me and I love the phone. I feel like I really stuck it to the man when I bought this phone, and that's what matters to me when it comes to these over priced Cell Phones!!",3,"Xiaomi"
"1200","B07HK4JNV1",4,"false","This is a great phone. It's especially good for the price. It runs smoothly, takes good pictures, and works very well with my service provider (TMobile). It's better by leaps and bounds than my last phone, which was a Motorola g5 plus. The only complaint I have is that the headphone volume is quite low. I use my headphone jack a lot, because I prefer wired headphones. That's the only downfall I've seen so far, and I've had the phone for about 4-5 days. The processor seems good. It's faster than the snapdragon 625 in my last phone. I'm left with about 60% battery after an 8 hour day at work listening to Spotify the entire time. Thats entirely acceptable to me. Fingerprint sensor works as it should. If you set region to Hong Kong you can use the face recognition. I'm still getting used to the full screen gesture function, but it seems to work well. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase. It's a fairly new phone, so I'm hoping some different cases are available within the next couple months. If you're looking for a new phone in this price range, you won't be disappointed.",27,"Xiaomi"

The package came very nicely packed and in a timely manner, an usual forte of Amazon. The 2 pin converter for U.S. was a nice touch plus the TPU soft case was a pleasant surprise. Since Saturday after getting the handset, I fully charged the phone straight out of the box (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) and today (Monday) it is at 65% *touchwood* It has gone through all updates, app installations, couple of video chats, photos. For $200 odd, this is a very good handset. I have been caught in two minds - Huawei or Xiaomi. After paying attention to some rumors of Huawei, I decided to go for Xiaomi and boy was I surprised! Battery life is excellent; lovely display and colors; fast responding fingerprint sensor. Slight disappointment of no facial recognition but that's ok for me.

This phone needs to go back into the lab and be tested more before being released to the general public. If you're simply looking for a phone for text/call it will serve your purpose. I need to copy video files from my computer via USB cable to the phone for portable viewing; if I can't do that then I will stick with my Lumina 950 until all Windows Mobile support goes out and then will invest in a Surface Pro for portable viewing of my After Effects videos and simply buy a cheap $85 Android phone for text/call service as that is all it is good for if I can't put my videos on there via USB cable.. I've spent 2 solid days trying valiantly to get this device to be recognized by Windows 10 Home and it simply isn't happening. So back it goes for a full refund. I'm all out of patience here.

"1214","B07HK4JNV1",4,"true","I bought this phone based on reviews at Amazon. Yesterday phone prompted for a firmware update and I said ok to update. After the update phone does not turn on. Called amazon tech support and xiaomi with no luck to revive the phone. I remember the firmware upgrade showing about 52 % then suddenly phone went off by itself as if the firmware upgrade aborted or something. amazon will give a refund for phone. sending it back. Never used the phone. Did not even put a sim card in it. Was getting ready with latest software and then this happens. Shouldn't xiaomi do some check sum for they are pushing bug free version of firmware to playstore and shouldn't phone verify the firmware it downloaded is good before it is applying ? There were several warnings not to touch power button during firmware upgrade. But what to do if phone goes off by itself during upgrade and becomes a brick by itself. My first and last purchase of Xiaomi phone. Update 06/11/2019. I am changing my review from 2 star to 4 star because the hardware of phone really is good only the firmware upgrade over the air went bad and bricked it - however there is a way to fix it. I did some google searches and found good copy the firmware is available at https://en.miui.com/download.html downloaded Redmi Note 6 Pro Latest Global Stable Version Fastboot File Download to my computer. Also downloaded the MIUI ROM Flashing Tool to my computer and installed it. Installed winzip and uncompressed the firmware. Pressed power button and volume down button together on phone to get fast boot prompt on phone. Connected phone to computer, via USB cable, ran the flashing tool, selected the source directory where uncompressed firmware is located. Then clicked flash button. This tool flashed or replaced the damaged firmware on phone with a good copy of firmware. It took a several minutes. But phone booted fine and good since then. https://en.miui.com/ website has all these instructions how to manually flash the firmware but you need some back ground too for doing this. Anyways happy that phone case and screen protector that i bough for this phone does not go waste if I were to return the phone for a full refund. Told Amazon I am keeping the phone.

"1217","B07HK4JNV1",5,"true","A beautiful powerhouse of a phone. I've never been so spoiled rotten with such long battery life (I went out for my usual PoGo walk and wasn't even close to needing a charge - I was walking around with three external power packs with my old phone just in case and usually went through my biggest one or my two smaller ones). Split screen worked great, apps ran smoothly. Apps started up so fast I barely realized they were starting up. Nice, large screen. I LOVED this phone. Only downside is that I could not see the screen at all if I was wearing sunglasses. There was really no difference in the brightness settings. But hands down, this is the best phone I've ever used. (To be fair, I do usually stick with the ""cheaper"" brands. I used Blu Studio for a couple versions, downgraded to a cheap tracfone, and am currently using a Huawei - which has more of the features I want but is not as good of a phone.) One other thing that did bother me with the phone that appears to be a feature in many smartphones now is how the alarm starts quiet and slowly gains volume. I need an alarm that just immediately blares and shocks me awake or else I'll likely be late to work. I didn't see a setting to change that, so that is something I'd like to see, as well as some change in the screen. Guessing the screen might be led instead of oled or amoled. However, unfortunately likely due to the seller giving me a refurbished phone without properly checking it, the screen totally died two months into use... conveniently a mere two days after the return period ended. Could absolutely be a coincidence, but it's definitely suspect. Unfortunately, I took my phone to one of the two local repair shops that could even look at Redmi's and they said they could not get a hold of a screen for it. Other shop had bad reviews, so I checked out getting a screen for myself. Only option was to wait a month, as I'm in the US. A month is a long time to not have a phone these days, so fortunately amazon processed a return for me, and I switched over to a Huawei. I'd love to return to a Xiaomi, but I'm not sure it's worth it due to the lack of technical support available here.",6,"Xiaomi"

The wifi connection to my 2.4/5G router also works flawlessly. Also, the AI powered camera works pretty nicely although not close to those expensive phones from Huawei, Apple or Samsung, but they also have much higher price tags.

The screen is gorgeous, the UI is quick and snappy (but definitely lacks customization options), and overall very satisfying phone to use. However, the problem with the phone, possibly because of the global/international version, is it has very VERY POOR reception, unacceptably poor in fact. I have MetroPCS and in my area I see full 4GLTE signal on Metro's coverage maps, but even with my old phone this was never a reality so I know from experience what coverage I should be expecting, and this failed to even get close to that. I regularly have ZERO bars and no service, but have seen as much as up to full five bars but no mobile data networks available. This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that either through Xiaomi or Metro, this phone has NO WIFI CALLING support. This a deal breaker. I legitimately cannot maintain a solid cell phone reception and the phone lacks the tools to remedy this. Like I can't even try to make calls, and if I do happen to have enough signal strength to do so, most calls so far have ended in the other person not being able to hear or understand me, or I lose signal entirely. I realize that each network is different and covers different perks dependent on phone, but as phone advertised to be compatible with these networks Xiaomi needs to be specific in which network bands they support, or at least create a version of their OS to be able to enable this functionality one way or another.

The standard configuration (rightmost in the picture) with a SIM card in the far slot did not work me. The configuration with the SIM (I just have one) in the microSD slot (leftmost in the picture) works!! That's the only reason for subtracting a star. Also this phone, though it advertises a 6.26 screen, feels much smaller than my MI Max3 (6.9"") or my Zte ZBlaze Pro (6.0""). This is because of the longer aspect ratio.

Sometimes it stays black despite tapping the screen, using the fingerprint scanner, or pressing the power button. 2)I am unable to fully sync my smart watch (fossil) with the phone.

I doubted to buy this cell because It's a first time for me using another device not Samsung, but I can tell, for the price you can't get a better device. I ordered a global version which means that I didn't have to install Android system. The device it's original. Unblocked so at the moment I inserted a SIM card I didn't have a problem at all. RAM is fast, frontal camera it's amazing, real camera, well, it's ok. About the battery, I was expecting something better, but at the end, I can recommend to buy this device if you need a fast cellphone, good quality, the screen it's big wich for me it's an advantage. Light, great design, I love this cell because I will be able to use it every time I travel. Unlocked with facial recognition and fingerprint scanner it's great! But if you need a facial recognition you need to setup to Hong Kong area. Cons.: You need to buy an adapter to use earphones and change the cell at the same time.

The experience I had with this phone is very much similar to using an Iphone 10. it's smooth, the camera is solid especially if you know a thing or two about photography. The speaker is amazing. The screen is sharp rich and blacks are really black almost like a Oled. Battery life is great too also supports quick charging. No IR Blaster on this one. Also supports face-unlock but region must be set to a supporting region. Finger print reader very fast. Navigation gestures and recent app screen very similar to IPhone which is great. The UI is also to me pretty and well designed. The phone is glass black and front and feels just like any other premium device. Gaming is not a problem doesn't matter which game except fortnite which isn't supported due to gpu. Upgradeable to android 9 pie. Option available to map power button to google assistant which is awesome. No NFC thus cannot make mobile payments. Also no wireless charging. Uses a usb type C port. Records (4k 30fps) (1080p 30/60/120 fps) (720p 20/60/120/240 fps) video quality in 4K is solid but can be a bit shaky. 1080p stabilization is amazing. Sound recording is also pretty decent. Overall very good deal. No need to spend 700 - 1500 to experience a premium device. [UPDATE] This phone now has an additional camera mode called night mode which produces better night time photographs. 1080p 60fps also refined. unlock your apps with your face data also added",76,"Xiaomi"

"1402","B07JMPGNHK",5,"true","Great midrange phone, good mix of features with nice cameras. Fingerprint reader and facial recognition are blazing fast. U.S. customers set your local region to Singapore to enable facial recognition. I know, it's really weird but it works. *Warning* Do not use this phone until you apply a screen protector. I do not know what the glass is but it is not any kind of Gorilla Glass. Mine cracked fairly easily. The good news is that the screen only had one crack going across one side that was nearly invisible unless viewed at an angle. I have applied a screen protector and now it serves as a reminder to always keep my phone protected. It in no way detracts from my enjoyment of the phone or impairs function.",1,"Xiaomi"

And let me tell you I wish I'd do it sooner, this phone can handle any game I've thrown at it like PUBG,FORNITE,VAIN GLORY,DRAGON BALL Z DOKKEN,MOBILE LEGENDS,POKEMON GO AND RUNESCAPE! I'm 6'2 so my hands are farely large and the size and dimentions of this phone are a PERFECT fit. The front facing camera takes crystal clear pictures in both Day to mid-day night time pictures with flash are equally clear without flash they look very pixaly, Selfie Camera is stunning I mean come in 24MP? super sharp and smooth are the pictures I'd I have to say so myself. BATTERY LIFE is excellent not huge but on a full charge whith normal use (web browsing,YouTube,social media,call,text) you can get almost 2 whole days with this phone. And when on heavy-pretty heavy use (gaming,streaming service Netflix etc, music) I would get at least a day and a half of battery. Very well rounded phone. It is USB-C and does come with a thin flexable case. Note: using on METRO-PCS/T-MOBILE I get 4G LTE, I live in Los Angeles at 3 to 5 bars of signal strength. CONS: NO HEAD PHONE JACK",6,"Xiaomi"

Upon my return home, I picked up the phone, reinstalled the sim, and rebooted the phone. It showed I had service, but barely a bar. Couldn't make a phone call with it.

Even iPhone XR does allow dual-sim but one of the number has to be an eSim and that is not very helpful when I travel to overseas with an actual sim card. Here are my preferences about this phone: Pro: * Dual-sim cards (this was my main purpose for shopping my 2nd phone. * Easy to control which sim card (phone numbers) I want to use. Turn both on / off or Turn one on / off. * Screen is a little larger than my iPhone XR and resolution in Xiami Mi 8 lite looks sharper and brighter than iPhone XR. * Weight is lighter than iPhone XR * Front & Back Camera are 24 & 12+5MP and beats iPhone XR (7 & 12MP). * A phone case is included with the phone * Easy to set up and be able to easily sync my Google mail account to Android system. (Sync both info on my iOS and Android phones) Con: * TOO FRAGILE.... the phone slip out of my phone and fall onto the ground when I took out from the box. It is about knee height (2ft), and the back panel glass cracked. But since it comes with a phone case, it doesn't bother me on using this phone. * US plug is cheap made looks like been chewed up by a dog or cat. This probably the seller includes a cheap plug for Xiaomi's international version phone. Overall, the Xiaomi Mi 8 Lite phone meets my expectations of my personal usages.",2,"Xiaomi"

I was a bit nervous purchasing a global phone but like it was advertised, it is compatible with my AT&T carrier that uses the GSM communication.

"1506","B07JMPGNHK",5,"true","No problems at all I love it 2 month update: the camera lense cracked like a week after I got it but it's still very well functional, not even noticeable. But what is noticeable is the quality of the camera or should I say the lack of. If whatever you're trying to take a picture of make sure it's still. The performance is by far one of the best values in mobile. I'm a bit tech savvy so I can strain a device pretty fast with all the stuff I'm doing with it such as, gaming (every game I tried runs smooth), running different launchers, constantly checking my social media, etc. But without any hiccups. By the end of the day I'll still well above the 40% mark. The charge times are phenomenal getting a full charge around 1.5 hours. Not bad if I should say so. I'm not surprised but it would've been a lot nicer to have nfc but it's no deal breaker. The speaker at the bottom of the phone to the right of the charging port is what you'd expect from a phone at this price range. Now with one more issue, I'm worried that my sim might stop working, I'm running on metro for those who want to know. The reason of this being I've seen reviews where their phone stopped accepting their sims and my phone after a reboot shows a message (sometimes) like ""sim card not found"" but it's usually no problem because it works still. Lastly the phone is pretty sturdy after the first drop which wasnt a very big drop, was the only one to cause significant damage. I've dropped this phone multiple times doing every day things and it just fly out of the pocket due to it having practically no texture.

I have also research on Xiaomi and I impressed with their business plan. The fact that they do not profit from this phones. They built them to provide other services to their customers.

"1510","B07JMPGNHK",1,"true","I received my phone today from Amazon Warehouse because I wanted to save a little money. Overall condition is great, screen and body show very little use can't find a fault. First problem was the battery had no charge, wouldn't boot it off the box at all. I had to connect the charger for about 15min to get it to show 1% on the display but the whole time I was thinking it was a defect. Upon fully booting to my surprise the phone was not reset and had email notifications ect on the lock screen but luckily had a pin password. I tried to factory reset the phone but it had been registered to xaiomi and required an additional password even after a factory reset. I am hopeful Xaiomi will be able to remove the lock after being on chat support and giving them my Amazon proof of purchase, but they said it takes 2-3 days for them to do it over the air. 1 star for not sending me a useable phone with someone else information clearly visible. edit: Update was made over the air to my phone to remove the old lock out after proof of purchase was verified. I still had to find a way around logging into my own Google account to finally take control of the phone because it had been factory reset first. I can not recommend taking the risk but if you don't mind a taking a few days to get to a useable device I was luckily able to get mine to work.",2,"Xiaomi"

"1515","B07JMPGNHK",5,"true","I have been using this product for a good 3-4 months to give it a proper review. Well, ultimately I'm impressed with this phone and it's capabilities at such a low price, although for it's price it's not bulky or heavy in anyway and has a nice sleek design to give it that higher phone tier feeling. Runs android 8.0, smooth and fluid interface thanks to the 4GB RAM (games run great when using medium settings), a great 12MP camera along with a 5MP AI (dual camera) to increase some aspects of video/ photos, the fingerprint scanner is great and very responsive, and a 1080p resolution to get the most out of your video. The battery life is decent, but thankfully to the USB-C fast charging it will bring the battery back up to 100% in about an hour and a half. The only issue I had with the phone is that when attempting to use the face recognition, you have to change its region to Singapore? It took awhile but no biggie, I have no idea why, but overall the face recognition is great I've tested it with photos of me that could have potentially unlocked it and there doesn't to seem to be any problem. The Xiaomi Mi 8 lite is a great buy for those on a budget and it is quite the steal for the price. Thank you and have a good day. (My photos were all taken using the AI camera enabled)",1,"Xiaomi"

The big downfall to this phone is, (and honestly would be my favorite phone to date if not for) the battery life is atrocious. I can easily go through two full charges in a day.

The in screen fingerprint sensor is good but it's a little finicky, if the screen isn't super clean it struggles. The UI is actually pretty good, and the form factor of the phone is beautiful. camera quality is far superior to what I was expecting low-light image qualaity and video quality surprisingly good. the phone either seems to have issues connecting to the listed LTE bandwidth or doesn't connect at all. Certain areas it would say I have full LTE but would show no connection when trying to use it. I checked the listed LTE bandwidth against my cell provider, and location, and there should have been no issues. I always had cell service was always able to make phone calls send texts, but SMS was an issue using the maps which struggle sometimes. I can't give the phone a terrible review for that, but obviously we buy cell phone so that we can use them on the go.

It makes it extremely difficult to use while at work or at home, because I get no service with it at all whereas I had no issues with any of my other phones prior.

"1548","B07N6N7JP3",5,"false","Let me just say wow never left Samsung after I had HTC, LG, AND SONY. The carrier I have is AT&T and I've used this phone for 2days of normal use. BATTERY- it's more than ok for such a small battery on a big screen right now it's 515 pm and I have 73p of light use. My note 8 would be dead by 2. I had a note 8 and it couldn't last three hours of screen on time at alone not using it at all. Humm ya 1000 I paid haha. PRICE- I paid 590 with tax and it comes with some extra in the box as people have posted,nice touch. Although there is no app drawer I found it easy just to put all the apps u don't use for the phone in one folder. Last thing I wanna say love the features for the price as well, best finger print scanner and two faces is the best thing on this phone . U can use this to switch from the phone u use to a completely blank phone that u can use as a second phone. As far as I know no phone company in us has that. Ok back again 2 day later I dropped my phone cracked camera lens still works as is but yet no replacement. They have replacements for all there other phones BUT this one. I would recommend putting a camera cover on it not lens, COVER. Jut type in camera cover for ur phone in Google and u can get them on Ebay as well.

"1549","B07N6N7JP3",3,"true","Good phone but needed to download a couple older apps and adjust some settings to get everything to work on Verizon. Contacted the seller and he was awesome and told me how to get it to work within a day.",NA,"Xiaomi"
"1550","B07N6N7JP3",5,"true","This is easily the best Android phone I've ever owned and I'm on number 11. The nearly bezel free screen is something to behold. No matter what you think of the idea of the slider in general, having no notch is just awesome. It's difficult to not understate how great the screen looks without a notch or punch out obstructing without seeing it with your own eyes. I love that the slider can be customized to open whatever you like. Mine opens Hangouts because I use that more than I take selfies. It also answers and disconnects calls no matter how you've customized it. Hanging up via the slider is strangely satisfying. MIUI is significantly better than I expected and very smooth but that's probably owed to the 845's speed chip more than anything else. That said, I had an oddly strong reaction to MIUI's square buttons and quickly installed Rootless Pixel Launcher and love the look now. Quick Ball sounds neat, and actually is once open, but was a bust for me because I feel it is too difficult to envoke quickly. I fully planned to root and go to stock Android but I don't feel a strong need now that I've installed all the equivalent pure Google apps. MIUI is somewhat aggressive in suggesting their own equivalent which will surprise no one. If you also want to go down the Google path for things like contacts, photos, etc., you should install all the Google apps before doing anything with the phone. When it detects two of the same on the device, it will present a pop-up asking which app to use and includes a radio button to always use that app. Contacts was the only tricky selection choice as they use almost exactly the same icon and are both aptly named simply Contacts. Hint: Google Contacts is a slightly lighter shade of blue. I botched that on the first try with the always option selected. Correcting that took some searching. If you're in that boat, go to Settings > (counterintuitively Installed Apps, not System Apps) Defaults > Clear Defaults. After that just do some action where the choice would be called up anew and carefully select the Google analog. The facing left side button is mapped to Google Assistant out of the box. What's in the box impressed me as a US consumer: 10A wireless charging pad, USB-A to USB-C cable, European style outlet adaptor, plastic snap on case, sim ejector. I activated the handset on Google Fi with a sim card I pulled directly from a Fi Nexus device without issue. I live in suberbia on the south shore of Boston and haven't noticed that I no longer have access to Sprint's network as I did with a full Fi device. TMobile LTE has been strong and reliable. Obviously, your milage will vary by location. As a puppy owner, I would have liked to have the option to use a SD as storage as I've managed to snap over 3,000 pics in six months time. Amazon's free full resolution photo backup has helped with that concern. FYI - You cannot use the extra sim slot for a SD card. If I enjoyed international travel sim #2 would be a nice feature. But I don't enjoy it so someone else will have to review that. Hint: Install your sim in the slot that will be nearest the bezel once the tray is inserted into the phone. The phone will activate regardless of the slot selected, but Google Messages (sms app) really, really wants it in slot #1. I haven't found information on the tray anywhere convenient. Sim #2 is the tray option that will ultimately sitting deepest into the device. Rear camera setup takes great photos with AI and HDR turned on. Neither are on by default until you set them. The speed in opening the camera app could be better. It's not slow (vs. Nexus 6p), but nobody will ever say it's blazing fast either. Hopefully future software updates will address this. Selfie camera also takes nice pics. The field of view took some getting used to as it's superior to phones I've used in the past. It's well worth investing five minutes to play around with the settings to get what suits your needs. I also want to mention I had a fantastic experience with the seller, Mega Mobile. I was able to get ahold of the owner within 60 seconds to request special shipping considerations. He took the call in his car on the way to the store! They included a free US outlet converter which was a nice surprise considering I was not expecting that and it must come out of their own pocket. Absolutely great customer service and lighting fast communication.",20,"Xiaomi"
"1551","B07N6N7JP3",5,"true","Overall this is a great phone. Configured it fine out of the box. Inserted my SIM and no problem with AT&T. For half the price of the phone from the Major Suppliers like Apple and Samsung you have a great phone. I had just dropped and broke my Samsung phone and did not want to spend $800 to $1200 on a phone. I did some research and this phone kept sticking in my mind. Pro's: Snapdragon 845, 128GB Storage, 6 GB Ram, Great Display, no notch. Con's: Not water proof P.S.: I installed an app called Nova Launcher as I do with all my android based phones and that allows me to customize it exactly as I want it. (see the image)",3,"Xiaomi"
"1552","B07N6N7JP3",5,"false","As a Verizon user, I did a lot of work before purchasing this phone. I never use iPhone, that left me not too much choice on cell phones. I once was a Samsung user, you may know that Samsung phones are slow since day one, and deteriorate as you use it more and more. This Mix 3 covers all the bands Verizon using, you can use it even it is not on Verizon phone list. You must have an activated sim card to activate the device. Verizon 4G LTE works perfectly fine on this phone, but you can't have WiFi calling. Due to sliding design, this phone doesn't have large battery, which is typical for Chinese cell phone. However, it lasts at least 1 day for me, much much better than Samsung Galaxy 7 I used. Mix 3 is a super fast cell phone, not too many bloat apps and memory management is just excellent. The complain I have is the GPS, sometimes GPS doesn't work very well, the solution is to restart the device, but it does have dual GPS, Beidou works on this phone too.

"1554","B07N6N7JP3",4,"true","It's an alright phone. Kind of took a risk buying it since I'm currently on Verizon, which the band is supported but the carrier isn't. Having said everything works well as it should except images fail to send most of the time over messenger. Battery life on this phone is quite poor compared to my old one ( essential PH-1) I'm assuming this is due to the larger screen. The camera is a bit iffy, most of the time taking really really good images and sometimes taking mediocre ones. Compared to my females pixel 3a, the images are slightly less sharp and there's alot more noise on this camera. This is using the stock app, I'm not much a picture person so I don't care too much. The hinge has worm alright I suppose, there is horizontal play of about 1mm in either direction which is definitely unfortunate. Never dropped the phone so I'm not sure the cause.",NA,"Xiaomi"

"1556","B07N6N7JP3",5,"false","I purchased Mi Mix3 phone from a different store but wanted to leave a review in Amazon. I got a jade green color which looks beautiful on the ceramic back. Mi MIX 3 is the best android phone I have had so far and I went through all the versions of Samsung Galaxy and Google. I am using my global version with stock launcher on T-mobile LTE with no connection issues. There is no T-Mobile WiFi calling feature, but I have T-Mobile 4G LTE signal booster for use at home as my area has weak LTE signal. If you absolutely need WiFi calling at work, this phone won't work for you. 1. Display is just perfect, bright and beautiful with no ugly front camera cutouts. 2. Sliding the phone by default opens the selfie camera, but customizable to any other app. 3. There is a separate button on the side of the phone (like Bixby), which is completely customizable as well. 4. I love how fast the finger print scanner works in this phone. Overall phone operation speed and app launching/operation is faster than my Google Pixel 2 XL and Galaxy note 9. 5. Always on display (AOD) works as expected most of the time (it tends to move up on the screen and turns off in low light conditions). 6. There is a small message indicator light which flashes white light. 7. There is a Edge Glow (similar to Samsung Galaxy phones) feature which is supposed to only work when you receive notifications and AOD is off. I noticed the glow on occasion with AOD on and now I am using a android app ""Always On Edge - Edge Lighting"" to further customize and use the feature. 8. The phone ships with a plastic phone case/10W wireless charger base/Type C-3.5 mm adapter cable. 9. Camera in this phone is one of the best in the business (especially in low light). 10. Battery appears to be on the smaller side but I have had no issues with moderate use (over 60% left from morning to bed time). 11. Ceramic back is beautiful but a fingerprint magnet ; I am still using the phone without a case, which makes it a bit slippery; I placed a back protector clear film which did not help with the fingerprints but a bit easy to hold. 12. Phone is ~10 grams heavy compared to the Samsung Galaxy note, but it has a great balance and well made feel. You will notice it in the front shirt pocket for few days after the initial use (especially with a case). 13. There is a small movement of the screen in the top left corner (when you tap), due to the slider mechanism, which is barely noticeable. 14. MIUI launcher/ software is very smooth and I never felt the need to root the phone and install vanilla android version. I just changed the defaults for the browser/text apps to google. There is a drop down menu similar to any android with a screenshot toggle. 15. MIUI gives you only two sound options Regular (audible ring)/Silent. Silent mode can be programmed to vibrate; I wish Xiaomi makes it simple with sound/vibrate/silent modes with next SW update. There is a Do not disturb (DND) mode which can be programmed. 16. The stock ""vibration intensity"" is very low compared to Samsung or Google phones. It is easy to miss a notification or call when the phone is inside the pocket especially with a case. I don't know if any apps can let you change the vibration intensity without rooting. 17. So far, I love everything about the phone which is made better than any other android at any cost. If I drop the phone and break the display, I may not easily find a replacement screen in the local store. For ~$550 phone cost compared to ~$900 I spent on Samsung/Google phones, I am taking that risk. Update 8/19: I am using the phone with Google Fi without any issues. When you sign up for Google Fi, choose any listed Xiaomi model and Google will send the SIM card free. Once you insert the SIM into Mi MIX3 it will prompt you for downloading the Google Fi app and activates the account. Google Fi works exclusively with T-mobile with MI MIX3 and while WiFi calling is not working, WiFi texting is working very well with the native android texting app. I am not even using the Google Hangouts.",77,"Xiaomi"
"1557","B07N6N7JP3",3,"false","I've owned the Mi Mix 3 for 5-6 months and I have developed a love hate relationship with this phone. I want so much to love it and except for one massive issue I do. The sad part is the massive issue is becoming a deal breaker and after i test it on other carriers and see no change it'll force me to purchase a different phone or reactivate my old phone. The issue is that cellular signal strength and connectivity wise this is the worst phone I've ever owned. I cannot maintain a signal for any period of time when stationary. Now this isn't entirely the phones fault as I am on t-mobile (metro) and almost equidistant from two towers. Given t-mobiles notoriously bad building penetration of their LTE signal and my rural location and the aforementioned tower locations I'm sure they share some blame. That having been said the problem is my other phones have been on the same network. As well as my daughter's phones. I've owned ZTE phones LG phones and the phone before this was a Huawei mate 9. My daughter has owned essentially the same devices except for when I bought the Mate 9 I bought her a pre-owned iPhone7. Since buying this phone I continually have to go in via the dialer code to set networks in order to stop the phone from constantly switching from LTE to 4g (3g but it's listed as 4g on this phone as 3g is outdated) which takes an eternity for it to finally grab a signal. It goes through every possible band several times before connecting to either the 3g signal or reconnecting to LTE. Neither myself or my daughter get even close to full bars but we can be sitting next to each other and I'll have a -118 - -127db signal strength and she will be at -100 - -110db. A prime example of how bad this phone is as far as signal goes is at the airport she had full bars of LTE and I had no service. That having been said I'll now delve in to the overall review. Build quality is amazing. And it is absolutely a stunner and conversion piece. You want your friends to lust after your phone this phone will do it. Not only because of the slider since other phones have more impressive solutions for hiding the camera (oneplus7 for instance) though it does turn heads. But the real attention grabber is the ceramic back. However I feel this beautiful part of the phone may be the causation of the connectivity issues (I could be wrong it could just be poor build quality in terms of antenna design but it's the first phone that isn't plastic or metal backed and it's the first with the issues as bad as this one has). The slider is rugged and I've no doubt that it will last as long if not longer than Xiaomi has stated. The screen is gorgeous and nearly 100% which is why I picked this phone. Performance is on par with flagships for the most part only falling slightly short but it's to be expected being priced at half the cost of the big guys. Miui is actually not a bad UI. I did root mine but haven't flashed a custom rom and I use Smart Launcher 5 in order to keep the screen clear of any icons widgets dots or any other items as I love a clean home screen. Overall I believe this is an amazing phone but probably best suited to someone in a city setting who doesn't venture out of the city very often if ever. Living in a rural area as I do makes this one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had. Obviously this phone is already outdated and will soon become obsolete once 5g is nationwide but if you want a quality built phone for a dang good price and live in a city or area with a strong cell signal, you'd be hard pressed to find a better option. For what it's worth I'd suggest the jade green it's absolutely beautiful though the ceramic back is slick and a fingerprint magnet. The includes case, while being cheap plastic, does a very good job of making it grippy. The wireless charger that is included is one of the best included accessories I've ever seen. Not super expensive but a nod to giving the customer the tools to fully utilize the phone as it is intended instead of creating a profit system built around having to buy peripherals and accessories to put the phone to proper use. I'm definitely impressed with Xiaomi and their dedication to building quality products at reasonable prices. I just wish I could give this a 5* but the signal issue is a massive problem. If I get it sorted and it turns out to be a network issue or operator error I'll happily bump it to 5*.",2,"Xiaomi"

"1560","B07N6N7JP3",5,"true","You may not have a technical background, so let me simplify things for you straight. This Xiomi phone model is as compatible with the ATT network as any other phone that ATT sells directly. You will not have any issues whatsoever. You can check third party websites like Kimovil for band compatibility and you will see that this phone runs on more ATT networks than even the high end iPhones and Samsung phones! Coming to the phone itself, its a beautiful device. The sliding mechanism is the highlight. The internal specifications of the phone easily competes against high end models in the market that would go for anywhere between $750-$1000. So unless you are a slave to iOS, just go head and enjoy this Android purchase. And, of course, remember the upside that with a phone this cheap upgrading phones every 2-3 years won't put you in a cycle of eternal debt as with iPhones. PS: I have used other Xiomi model phones before and have loved all of them.",NA,"Xiaomi"
"1561","B07N6N7JP3",5,"true","I went through a few phone until I landed on this one. It has all the band (no band 71 on TMobile) that you need for TMobile and AT&T. The build and feel of the phone is great. Signal is great in the area that I spent time the most, but should not be a problem anywhere with all the bands that it includes. The phone is fast, pictures are great, full screen and a slider that's very addictive. Miui is simple and fast , just no app drawer. battery life and charging speeds are great for my use. I always make it a full day with charge left over. I started with this phone on metro PC's for 2 months and the service was good with spotty coverage at my worksite. Then I recently switched to At&t prepaid $50 plan and the service is even better. With At&t this phone covers every band that they have. I have researched this phone working on Verizon but it takes a bit of work to get it up and running, although possible.",1,"Xiaomi"
"1562","B07N6N7JP3",5,"true","I have to knock it on battery solely because the Pocofone spoiled me, but the AMOLED screen and higher quality of the Mi Mix 3 is one of the best phones I've owned. After adjusting to MIUI and coming from the LG G6 and Samsung S7 to the Pocofone and now the Mix, I am going to stick around for a while. Now for the drawbacks. While it does have a smaller battery at 3300 mAh so you have to make use of the quick charge but that is amazing so it's not a big deal but you'll have to charge at some point at least for 30 minutes or so. There is no headphone jack which is disappointing but considering I just stream to my car is not that big of a deal and honestly I wouldn't know how they could get one in there anyway with the slider mechanics.",NA,"Xiaomi"

It looks like the seller opened the box and took out the original case that comes with the phone and included some bullsh*t case that does nothing for the phone. Do you think we, the consumer, is stupid? This is unforgivable and unacceptable and I want my original Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 case that is supposed to come with my phone. Look, if you're taking out the original case and selling it as a single item, that's dishonest, bro. I want my case. We all read the reviews on these phones and we all know what it's supposed to come with. DO THE RIGHT THING. I included a picture of the case that is supposed to come with the phone.

The case is only meant for scratch protection. I dropped the phone from 1 foot off the ground and the left bottom corner dented in and only the left bottom corner of the screen cracked.

"1567","B07N6N7JP3",5,"true","Even though this phone might already be considered ""old"" by some, its rich feature set and value price still made it the best option for me, even today. At time of writing this review, I found no other phone that had both of these features: complete bezel-less display (no notch or hole punch!), wireless charging, and a decent fingerprint reader. It's a simple feature list with only three requirements, but I found no other phone that had all of these features in one package --- certainly not for $450! As an added bonus, a wireless charger is even included. I really enjoy the sliding mechanism as well... Lei Jun (Xiaomi CEO) was right, this phone does double as a pretty rewarding ""fidget spinner."" It's even more fun if you have the sounds turned on. Personally, I try to keep my sliding to a minimum however so as not to disturb my coworkers. One of my favorite features however is actually the fingerprint reader. It's extremely fast and has been very reliable, and I love the feel of the ceramic. That said, the ceramic back is an extreme fingerprint magnet so I would definitely recommend using the included case (which is quite nice) if that bothers you. My favorite case however is the DAYJOY Textile Silicone Bumper, which I compared to many other aftermarket cases. You can find it on Amazon if you find the included case not quite to your liking. I haven't had any issues with battery life or signal strength, but if the phone dies within 3 months as some other reviewers have unfortunately experienced I will definitely come back to update this review. Overall, for $450 this is a great buy, even as of 2019.",NA,"Xiaomi"

Once I used the dial code to activate Voice over LTE (Google it) then used Vzn messages as my default messaging app, it worked brilliantly. The keyboard strokes are effortless for texting, the camera feature is really fun, and the software interface is a pleasure. The wireless charging actually works very well too, which surprised me.",1,"Xiaomi"

"1572","B07N6N7JP3",4,"true","After having multiple Samsung Galaxys and Iphones I've gotten tired of paying $800 or more for a phone. At this stage in the game all the phones are able to do the basics....and Im not looking to play AAA quality games on my phone (though it will). The phone is hefty in the hand, which I actually like. Having a slightly heavier phone actually causes me to grip it better....less chance of dropping it. But that is a personal preference. The screen is crisp and clear....I dont need 4k on my phone, I wouldnt be able to tell the difference anyways. It responds quickly and there do not appear to be any hiccups while moving about on the phone. I was disappointed that it does not have a headphone jack. I don't own a pair of usb c headphones and 90% of what I have in my house uses the jack style. There is an included adapter, but...I still prefer just to have the jack. I can easily get a day and a half from this phone without charging it....and it charges way faster than my galaxy s9+ did. The camera....is far from perfect. It takes still shots fine. The quality is good...not great. There is not a front facing camera...and with android it appears to always have that option, so when I tried to take a selfie with family a black screen appeared. Not a big deal, but different from other phones. The MI UI is quite different from what Im used to with the standard android on the galaxy phones. I would consider it a downgrade...not as intuitive.....and the appearance of ads while installing software which appears to be part of the UI just doesnt sit well with me. I suppose I could root the phone and swap the UI, but its close enough that I wont bother. Either way, this phone is a great value if you dont want to spend a grand on a phone that will do pretty much everything this phone does.",1,"Xiaomi"

The build quality is top notch. This is an excellent phone but it does have some cons. Cons: No LTE band 71 for T-Mobile (It does have band 66 though!) No WiFi calling and I don't think it has VoLTE either with T-Mobile. When I make a call the symbol goes from LTE to 4g. I'm not sure what that means. MIUI is overwhelming and could be confusing for a lot of people. You can get used to it just like I did but it'll take a good week, especially if you're using their gestures. The vibration motor isn't the best but it's not terrible. The bottom firing speaker isn't very good. It doesn't get very loud but it gets the job done. No water resistance.",1,"Xiaomi"
"1577","B07N6N7JP3",4,"true","Really liking this device, very fast and responsive I'm upgrading from a Mi 8 and I can tell the difference between the 2 devices. Even though it has a SD 845, last year chipset, it's still really good in 2019. Having 6GB RAM makes every app runs very smooth. Didn't have any issues with connective using US carrier (T-MOBILE) whether receiving calls/texts/notifications, I like that it has NFC specially for using multiple headphones/ear buds it made it easy to pair. No issues on running any apps runs smooth. Yeah it has a ceramic back, which attracts fingerprints but that's normal with the new cell phones now a days, whether it's ceramic, glass or even high gloss plastic back. It will leave fingerprints. I know that most of Xiaomi phones doesn't have a app drawer but that's an easy fix. Download a free app launcher from Google Play store. The MIUI OS is easy to get used too. The gesture navigation is amazing. The slider is built solid, no issues on using it whether taking selfies or just sliding it up & down. Probably want to get a case for the phone, it a slippery phone. I don't have a case because I'm using a pop socket. Definitely worth it. Loving the bezel less display, colors are nice and vibrant.",NA,"Xiaomi"
"1578","B07N6N7JP3",5,"true","amazing phone. Great price. I plan to keep this one for a while. Some quick notes: -Slightly larger and heavier than most other similarly spec'd phones, due to the slider mechanism. I don't mind the extra weight, its just more noticeable when you first get the phone. -Build quality and materials are top notch. Phone feels really nice. -This phone has near flagship level specs, even at the end of 2019. For a bargain of a price. -MIUI 11 is fast and responsive. Not a fan of the launcher though. so I'm using Nova instead. -Get a screen protector. Quite sure this thing doesnt have gorilla glass. -Get a case, checkout ebay or banggood.com for the 2 piece cases so the phone can still slide with a case on, and its not exposed like the one piece case that came with the phone. banggood has $5 cases that are pretty nice. -------- Just for your awareness, there's a way to enable both VoLTE and VoWIFI on MIUI V10+ Use these codes in the dialer: VoLTE *#*#86583#*#* VoWIFI *#*#869434#*#*",NA,"Xiaomi"
"1579","B07N6N7JP3",5,"true","I don't like leaving long novels for product reviews so I'll try to be brief: This phone has ALL of the features of phones like the iPhone X, Galaxy S10, or any other ""flagship"" device at less than 1/2 the price. The OLED screen is stunning and very nearly bezel-less thanks to the slide-out selfie camera. I use my phone camera all of the time so this is a very important feature to me and the Mi Mix 3 has one of, if not THE best smartphone cameras on the market. I've attached a few sample shots but the photos this phone produces never fail to impress; The built-in ""Night Mode"" is at least as good as the version on the Pixel phones if not better and it handles even the most challenging lighting situations without needing to fiddle with settings. The phone looks and feels amazing in the hand, though a word of warning - while the ceramic body is nearly impossible to scratch, it WILL crack if dropped. And it's probably the slipperiest phone I've ever owned. This thing will slide off of flat surfaces you set it on if they're not completely level. Finally, the other main reason I bought this phone: The network support. This will work on virtually every major network, whether in the U.S. or abroad. Check sites like willmyphonework.net for your specific carrier before ordering but I can confirm that it works on Verizon based networks like Total Wireless and Page Plus. *You will need a Verizon-approved device to activate your SIM card but after that you can switch it to this phone.* You may need to manually enter your APN settings to get data working but this is something you should only have to do once. And with the Dual-Sim support, I was even able to stick a U.K. SIM card in when I traveled abroad without any issues. This comes unopened in the original packaging. The seller was kind enough to include a U.S. style power adapter in the box so that the original charger could be used. 5 stars for the phone and 5 for the seller.",NA,"Xiaomi"

As somebody who never uses the front camera(s), this is an ideal device. Enabling gesture navigation allows, from edge-to-edge, a truly unimpeded (and stunningly gorgeous) OLED viewing experience. I usually am not a fan of custom Android versions from Samsung's God-awful TouchWiz days, but MIUI is surprisingly robust, fluid, and pretty good looking to boot. It's theme-able, but if you're like me and it's still not entirely to your style, this device can be bootloader unlocked and flashed with custom images. The phone does unfortunately come with a few Xiaomi apps pre-installed, but most of them are unobtrusive and one or two are, admittedly, actually useful.

"1664","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","This is one of my first phones, and it is as far as i can tell, perfectly functional. Performs very well in games, takes okay pictures (has no problems with detail, but edges give it trouble). The battery has lasted me up to 3 days before, but my normal usage currently gets about 2 days. The one annoyance I've had to adapt to is constant loss of WiFi signal. And not even that, really. It just randomly disconnects and doesn't automatically reconnect. You have to enter the Wifi menu and reselect your Wifi network. Sometimes if you have a lot of things open and haven't cleared the cache in a while, the phone will start to noticeably bog down, mostly on lock/unlock phone commands and responsiveness of the on-screen home/return/assistant buttons. A quick clear cache or restart fixes this. Otherwise, a very solid phone and you won't be hurting much in the wallet department if you bust it up.

"1669","B07PY52GVP",3,"true","I've had this phone for about a month and hav been using for about 3 weeks now. The picture quality and battery life are great! The phone came with a European type charger as these phones aren't designed to be sold in the US yet. Two days ago I made a call to my wife while we were both at the supermarket. I called her to find her in the store. I could hear he voice fine. Yesterday, I received two calls back-to-back and thought the sound in the earpiece was gone completely or that I may have accidentally set the phone to mute. Turns out there was sound but it was so faint that I couldn't possibly make a call. I tried the speaker function and it worked well. I haven't yet tried hooking up a headset/earbuds to try that function. Here is the kicker, I tried contacting support and the title in the chat window states US support yet they said they do not have technical support for the US. They gave me an email that I sent a message to and I'm now waiting for a response. So, basically, I'm saying that currently Mi (Xiaomi Redmi Note manufacturer) states they have no US support but can sell phones in the US and that I have no usable earpiece function after less than one month use.",1,"Xiaomi"

It works very well. It's missing a few of mint/T-Mobile's frequencies and indoor signal can be a little less than full lte like outdoors. The note 7 can't send and receive calls over WiFi which is a nice feature. Camera, phone, WiFi, finger print scanner all work well. The screen is clear and crisp with good color balance. Battery life is great and it charges quickly with the us/international adaptor. Really a great phone for $190usd. Replaced a 4 y/o Nexus 5X on Google Fi that boot looped.

"1682","B07PY52GVP",4,"true","I have the 64/4 gb version. The camera on this phone is simply amazing. For the price point, this phone is incredible. I have used it so far in the US, Canada, and Mexico with no connection issues. The phone has so many bands built in it should be no issue in most parts of the world. The Pros: The price point, It has Android 9, The camera is phenomenal, memory and the snapdragon 660 chip is sufficient and have had no lag issues for general web surfing and occasional low-intensity graphic game playing, bluetooth and gps works well, this phone is packed with all kinds of sensors, the phone is unlocked and is a true global phone, works with virtually any GSM carrier, the company will allow you to unlock the bootloader so you can customize this phone and add custom roms, there is software available to backup your phone, there is third party software available to remove the annoying ads and hard-coded apps, the MIUI 10 android interface is very user friendly and extremely customizable with all the bells and whistles, their free pocophone launcher is a better alternative than the preinstalled launcher, large phone that has a bright clear screen. The phone charges to 50% in 10-15 minutes. With normal internet browsing the phone lasts almost 2 days for me on a single charge. Cons: the spyware and ad apps that are hardcoded into the phone, this is stuff that connects to Chinese servers and uploads your contacts and photos to their servers. You can turn these off, but it makes it a bit harder to use the phone in a functional way. There is third party software to remove these apps located on the net. The ads are extremely annoying and are placed within some of the system menus. You can turn these off, but on every update, they seem to return. You have to wait days in order to unlock the bootloader. You get a version 3 qualcomm fast charger, even though version 4 is available and works with the phone. Once I hacked this phone (which voids any warranty), the phone is a gem in the rough. I have uploaded the official European MIUI system into the phone that is much better than what comes stock on the phone. I've removed all the bloatware and spyware and it is perfect. My fiance had an apple 7 and was getting ready to upgrade to an Apple X, I let her use my phone and she liked it so much she wanted this one instead of spending $1000 on the apple.",8,"Xiaomi"

"1690","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","I just wanted to clarify that LTE does exist. People may be believe it doesn't because they don't see the LTE words. It seems when WiFi is activated the words don't show. Turn off WiFi and you see them just fine. Wireless charging can work if you purchase an adapter. So if it is a must have just get one. Note the standard charging cable for Android phones doesn't work with this phone as it uses a USB Type C cord for quick charging. You will need an adapter or just purchase a new cord if you desire a longer cord. From owning the 5, I suggest not signing up for MUI account. This can have annoying pop up ads on your phone. I found once I closed that account, I had no more issues. If you find you still want to use it, I suggest downloading Blockada to aid with that. Those ads occur simply because that is how Xiaomi is able to keep the phone price low. If you desire a more true to Android experience then take a look at the Mi series. Otherwise, this phone, its features and its camera are perfect! If one more person that uses an Apple phone tells me I need to get one ... I will be giving the side eye for the rest of my life. I have never desired one. I like the fact that if I want to upgrade features or just change phones in 2 years I'm not spending a gazillion dollars for a slight change of features or design. With the way technology evolves, why does that make sense? Compared to the 5 the body is slightly thicker and there is also a slight weight difference. It is not bad just different. Lastly, there was a water submerge test done YouTube on this phone. I suggest watching it. Pretty great results. If you want to save some more money, purchase open box. I have found that sometimes it is a return due to wrong color being sent or someone thought LTE doesn't work, when it does.",1,"Xiaomi"
"1691","B07PY52GVP",4,"true","Over all this is a great phone for $200.

I don't mind this, but I notice when taking photos with friends, they get a little irritated with how slow it is to take a photos. (But once you get a photo it looks nice and is really crisp!) Touch screen: The screen on this phone looks great, really crisp and colorful. It is dim for out door use though. But it's just bright enough for me to use as a GPS in my car just fine. The touch sensitivity on the screen could be better. When my wife uses my phone she always comment on how big and beautiful the screen is, but also how the touch sensitivity could be better. I am still very happy with my purchase. This phone is beautiful, takes good photos and is plenty powerful enough to use all the apps I need for work and play, including some mobile gaming. The battery always lasts me through the whole day even with heavy usage. The finger print scanner is crazy fast. I get good coverage with my At&t provider.

"1705","B07PY52GVP",4,"true","This phone is really incredible for the money, and it puts Apple and Samsung to shame. It absolutely holds it's own against more expensive phones. The biggest thing you are going to be losing is the software. The software consists of the necessary and basic features of an Android phone. There aren't many of the special features that Samsung offers in their phones. For me this is actually another bonus. I didn't have to go through the settings for 30 minutes turning off features that I was never going to use. It's just a simple usable phone with great hardware and an eye-pleasing 6.3 inch display. There are two reasons that this phone does not get 5 starts. The first being that the back is made of glass. It is a well built phone but there is no reason that any phone should have a glass back. All this does is weaken the structure of the phone and make it considerably slippery (increasing the chance of drops and breaks). My last phone has a glass back and it was the only phone I ever broke because of it. In Xiaomi's defense, the phone does come with a free case to protect it and I really appreciate that. The second reason is the Mi UI. It's very basic. So much so, that it seems to lack some things. For example, I haven't quite figured out how to do a group text with the Mi texting app. After some research it seems like it might not even be possible, which is a little frustrating. Bottom line: If you are thinking about this phone because your current one is busted or you want a good upgrade for a great value, then just buy it.",2,"Xiaomi"

Captures all my wrong notes perfectly. LOL. Pianos are notoriously hard to record, but the playback was perfect. No distortion, no issues like the sound being unbalanced, sound muffled, excess echo. My friend's Huawei Pro 30 does that but it is 5 times the price. I'll be anxious to compare.",2,"Xiaomi"

It's as if though I took the pic from close up. 4 those who had an issue with the screen timing out after 1 min all u have to do is go into ur settings. Then go to the category that says system & device. Then click on option that says screen lock & password. Then click on sleep & there u go. I have straight talk service & as some of u may know with a GSM device u can choose between T-Mobile or att compatible sim cards from straight talk. Well where I live there is no T-Mobile or att wireless coverage in my area. So this is what I did. I ordered a Verizon compatible sim card from straight talk. When I got the card I stuck it in my friends Verizon prepaid phone. Then I called straight talk from a different phone & had my sim card activated.

"1710","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","A $200 dollar phone with gorilla glass 5 front and back pannels? For once, glass body phones make sense. I always thought glass front and back pannels were expensive gimmicks that Apple and Samsung pioneered to ensure their built-to-break products would aways need replacing. In this case, glass on back really does feel like a luxury. This phone is supposed to be $150. So much for that miracle. I got the 64gb global version for $230. Four years ago motorolla's g4 could be had for this price. And it was mostly a plastic phone with a gorilla glass 3 screen. The cheap phone industry is so awesome these days! I feel like I got a good deal based on specs even at $230. If you are serious about buying this phone, you have probably done your research, as all the honor, Huawei, redmi, and xiaomi phone basically look the same right now. Coming from the outstanding Galaxy S7, I felt unsure about the whole Chinese brand and MiUI. My fears are dashed. Even though my s7 benched better, this phone is fast. It's not even the ""pro"" version. Screen is so good. I don't care about cameras, but it's supposed to be good with the pixel 3 camera app loaded. So yeah. Get the phone. Especially if it ever sells for $150.",9,"Xiaomi"

"1712","B07PY52GVP",4,"true","-El RN7 es un excelente celular a un muy buen precio. La bater√≠a que tiene es casi infinita, te da para un d√≠a completo f√°cilmente. Incluso si se cuida bien las aplicaciones que se usan y dem√°s lleg√°s a las 48 horas sin cargarlo y con un 25-20% de bater√≠a. O sea, es un tel√©fono con muy buena autonom√≠a. -Otra a cosa a destacar es la pantalla, la resoluci√≥n es excelente, se ve muy muy bien. -Es un celular grande, as√≠ que tal vez no sea para todo el mundo porque hay gente que le gustan de dimensiones m√°s modestas. A veces es medio inc√≥modo para usar a una mano por su tama√±o (y eso que tengo las manos m√°s o menos grandes) pero hay un modo a una mano que se puede activar en opciones, as√≠ que no es ning√∫n problema. - El audio es bueno, suena fuerte y n√≠tido, aunque no llega obviamente a un nivel de sonido de un parlante, pero para lo que es cumple perfectamente. - La verdad que los 64 GB de memoria interna son bastante ya de por s√≠, de todas formas le pod√©s ampliar la memoria mediante una SD, as√≠ que es imposible quedarte sin espacio. - El desbloqueo con huella anda impecable, es muy r√°pido. El desbloqueo facial, lo mismo, es rapid√≠simo, aunque tal vez no sea lo m√°s seguro. - Por el precio que tiene la c√°mara es muy buena, aunque es imprescindible descargar la GCAM, la mejora en las fotos es muy notable. Lo negativo: - Es fundamental comprarle un vidrio templado porque ya se me cay√≥ unas 2 o 3 veces y se ven rayones, no a simple vista, ten√©s que buscarlos bien, no molestan, no se ven salvo que te pongas muy quisquilloso, pero igual. Es lamentable que se te caiga un par de veces y ya hayan rayones por la pantalla del cel. La funda y el vidrio templado son obligatorios. - Otra cosa, cuando vas a escuchar audios por wpp por ejemplo, tenes que poner el tel√©fono en horizontal por la ubicaci√≥n de los parlantes, sino se corta el audio por el sensor. Esto es inc√≥modo. De todas formas, estas 2 cosas pasan en casi cualquier tel√©fono, as√≠ que no es tan reprochable. Por lo dem√°s, no tengo quejas. Lo recomiendo rotundamente.",8,"Xiaomi"

"1726","B07PY52GVP",1,"true","Update 10/24/19: Ok the screen on this phone is horrible. First of all you cannot take pictures in full sun because of the horrible glare on the screen. Secondly, i dropped the phone (in its case) from a short distance to the floor and the bottom lefthand corner broke. It costs $150 to replace screen, which looking at the cost of the phone, I really don't see the point. Seller says too bad. I used an Iphone 6s for 5 years without screen ever breaking and there was no glare. Unfortunately battery life was awful and from what I have heard, I would need to get at least a 10 to get decent battery life. Guess I'll just try to live with a busted phone. Bummer. Original review: I have always had Iphones but got tired of the cost and the short battery life. This phone holds a charge when you're playing games I charge it every other day even with heavy usage.

"1727","B07PY52GVP",4,"true","We have replaced older Android phones (Huawei and Samsung) with a pair of Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 phones. So far, so good, and it's clear that this is a very good budget cellphone. I've never been one to have to own the latest, greatest cellphone, but prefer something reliable and affordable. Set up was easier than expected, and these phones perform fine on our carrier, Ting. Call quality is good, connectivity has not been an issue 90% of the time, and the user interface overall good save for two very irritating issues. First, the installed MI text message application proved a bit of a disaster. Group texts are received as individual text messages, which created much frustration and consternation. I installed a 3rd-party texting app with better features and made that my default. (I have not checked to see if the system updates have fixed this nuisance.) Second the operating system is set to push ads and offers. Clear the cache, and you might get an ad for a technical college. Scan for viruses, and you get ads for games or products that could possibly contain viruses. Photo, video, recorder, and other functions are good enough for our daily uses. The FM radio app is so so. Not a perfect phone, but for the price point, quite acceptable.",2,"Xiaomi"

"1760","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","I was torn for days about buying this because people on reddit and other forums talked about how difficult it was to get it working in the US, but it ended up being surprisingly easy to setup. I ordered a Straight Talk AT&T Sim Card and a service plan, received the sim in a few days via free Fed Ex shipping, and then inserted it into the Redmi Note in sim slot #2. I read online if you set up a data or phone service in sim slot #1, you can no longer use any other card on #2. I followed the instructions Straight Talk sent along with the sim and my phone service and LTE data was working right after a restart. It was very easy, it definitely works with Straight Talk in Denver, CO USA. No problems with data or LTE bands, or making/receiving phone calls as of 9/17/2019. As for the phone itself - it's probably the best phone I've ever owned personally. I've only had fairly cheap phones so I can't tell you how it compares to the current flagship iPhone or Samsung. It's very fast, responsive and intuitive to setup. I immediately installed Nova Launcher, Adguard for ads/trackers, and none of these slowed the phone down in the slightest. The battery lasted all day and evening, through an 8 hour work shift where I had bluetooth, Wifi, and was playing HD video. I think when I went to finally plug it in before being up with it for around 18 hours, it was still at 40%. I can't comment on whether or not fast charge works as I don't believe the charger they sent is capable of doing that. It charges quickly enough though. There were a few bugs with scrolling/picking up my fingers sometimes that alarmed me but went away after a restart. I assume it's just Miui updating or other apps updating. The screen is beautiful and clear. The phone comes with a back cover which is fine, I guess - I probably will get something different. I plan on setting up a mod from XDA forums, and that will be a process in itself because I've read unlocking the bootloader on this phone is a days/weeks long process. I will update this later when I get into using the camera or other features. Still testing everything out! I feel at this point, you cannot go wrong with buying this phone. At it's price point you get a phone that looks and feels expensive, has a big screen, the same processor as things 3x it's price, plenty of ram, and a great camera (this requires tweaking), and can pretty much run most things you throw at it. If you don't like MIUI, you can change that later on. Don't be intimidated about setup for a prepaid service! Lots of information out there says you can't do it, but it completely works.

"1809","B07PY52GVP",2,"true","At first sight and use, phone seems great but after a couple days and usage, with apps, memory and trying to multitask, phone has many glicthes, from apps and system performance that either causes it to lag severly or in certain circumstances not work at all. Also cell service was very week compared to every other phone I have had using the same service in the same arwas, which caused the lag to seem torturously slow.

The screen is nice and bright.the phone is quick and snappy. And the camera is great. I looked at so many phones in this price range and this appeared to be the best value. So glad I went with it.

"1856","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","This is a fantastic phone and has exceeded all of my expectations. It works great on Cricket/ATT and I get LTE all the way up in Western Upstate New York. The sides are plastic but they are very tough and with a case you won't even notice. And as far as cases go, the one in the box doesn't really cover much of the camera bump and it's kinda meh quality overall so I bought the matte black Anccer style case for $10 and am super pleased with how it makes the phone feel/look. The phone is fast, no real lag to speak of, and is only just a hair slower than my One plus 6t. The camera is crisp and takes great photos, also on par with my 6t, but if you install GCam the photos are even better. Yes, there are ads. But you can turn them off, despite what the other reviewer said. There's an option to do so as you're setting up the phone and you can turn them off within the apps own settings as well if you missed that option. There are some ads in the theme store but they're an inch tall, only show up once, and you can X out of them immediately or just not use the xiaomi theme store. Seriously, for $150-$250 this is a device that's really hard to beat",39,"Xiaomi"
"1857","B07PY52GVP",2,"true","My device happened to be defective, namely in that plugging it into my computer never worked. I'd have to manually alter files and settings from my PC in order to be able to view the device's folders and upload files to it. Installing drivers and Xiaomi's applications did not help this problem. It might be a exception, but it still warranted a return. For $200 the build quality is good, glass screen and back with noticeable weight and a good overall shape. The sides are plastic, but sturdy. Only the buttons really stood out to me as ""cheap,"" but again, for $200 it's nothing terrible. The vibration unit built into the phone is probably the cheapest feeling part, and I ultimately disabled it because it just felt... off. It's quite a chunky, bulky vibration, not a smooth and constant shake from more expensive devices like Apple of Samsung. The operating system is smooth, responsive, and intuitive. There's no dark mode however. It's also crammed with bloatware from both Xiaomi and Google, some of which is more useful than others. Battery life is solid from my time using it, and the camera was good, again, for a $200 phone. I keep mentioning ""for $200"" because that's what you should be keeping in mind with this device. It's a budget phone, not a flagship or flagship killer. And for $200, it's a VERY good phone. Had mine not had the issues it did, it would easily be a 4.5/5 or even 5/5 for the money. I was impressed with the features, build quality, and performance of it.",18,"Xiaomi"

"1865","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","A serious upgrade from my Honor 7X in every way. The speaker is louder and better than the speaker on the Honor 7X and the iPhone 6x. We did direct comparisons. The cameras are great. The vibrater motor is something I really didn't even think about appreciating until I got thie one. The only thing I will say isn't perfect but not enough to call a minus is the included TPU case.. it's serviceable but it doesn't consider the camera bump like most aftermarket cases available on amazon. The camera bump sticks out with no protection leaving it exposed to get scratched on surfaces. It's a good tool to keep your phone temporarily protected until your actual case comes in. Make sure to look for the recessed camera opening that leaves the back completely flat. When you start looking through them,. You'll understand what I'm talking about. Anyway, amazing phone at just around $200.",4,"Xiaomi"
"1866","B07PY52GVP",3,"true","I expected very little of this $200 phone. I went to Best Buy and only phones over $400 felt like they would be any improvement over my dying HTC One. The specs on this looked fine and I really don't care about phones so the price was right. I was immediately impressed with the build quality, and once I navigated through the landmine of advertisement checkboxes during installation, I was impressed with how snappy it was. The battery charges super fast and holds out for two days of use for me. Fingerprint scanner works great and is in the perfect location. Came with a clear silicon cover, a US adapter, and USB-C cable (white). But, something just isn't right with the 'MIUI' implementation of Android. There is no indicator light, so you'd have to rely on the lock screen to know if you got a text or call. But, things only randomly appear on the lock screen, maybe 2% of the time. The notification bar doesn't display app icons consistently either. Sometimes they'll be there, sometimes they'll disappear as you stare at it, but most of the time it's empty. I've yet to get an app to successfully show a heads-up notification, so maybe that concept just doesn't exist in Xaomi world. I've also given up on getting it to send notifications to my Fitbit; I can send test notifications from the Fitbit app but that's it. This seems to be a known issue, which I didn't consider searching for before buying the phone. If this ever gets fixed in a software update I'll pop back over and update this review.",4,"Xiaomi"

The camera is great and the quality for the price is obscene, the phone is snappy and fast and makes me feel like I'm using an iPhone, it also has great security features and the first one that was stolen was easily tracked and locked down.

The ads are all disabled and I never see any... All who complain about the ads have no idea how to use the device properly. All that needs to be done is turn off recommendations in the mi apps and turn of certain app push notifications. It is a small tradeoff for the quality you get. Thank you for shipping it to me so fast.

"1928","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","Band 17 is supposed to be the main LTE band in my area, which this doesn't support. However, I've gotten around 30mbps on a few occasions.

About 20 minutes with tech support and I had the phone on LTE with my new SIM (old phone didn't have nano SIM). I'm glad I took the risk and bought this phone. Overall I'm very impressed. Waiting for LineageOS official support.. I'm coming from an HTC One M7. I used to go MANY years between getting a new phone. Not anymore. Not at this price point.

"1931","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","I'm impressed with the Redmi Note 7. üôÇ I'm a true tech geek when it comes to mid-range smartphones. They are simply better and more worth your money for the price tag. Build quality: The Redmi note 7 is made of a ""plastic"" like material on the frame of the body and it is equipped with a glass back. It doesn't feel cheap by any means and it is a rather light phone compared to my old iPhone 8 plus, Moto e5 and lg v20. The front and rear cameras along with the finger print scanner and the main screen itself are all protected by gorilla glass 5. So you can be sure your car keys won't scratch or damage the phone. Performance: The phone is fast! The snapdragon 660 is smooth and impressive in many ways. I play multiple games (not pub g yet but I will test it and let you know if there is any game lagging). Without any lag and I run multiple applications simultaneously without any problems what so ever. Cameras: You won't be disappointed. üôÇ Just download gcam.apk through Google for the Redmi note 7 and it takes the cameras to new levels. I just use open camera for recording which it does beautifully in 4k@30 fps. The stock camera app isn't terrible, but it's also not the best especially with what these cameras can offer for such a low price. With a good update Xiaomi can fix minor problems, pictures come out more bland with the stock camera app compared to vibrant with the gcam app Battery Life: Is great, you will get a solid 2days with normal to heavy usage, including having GPS and cellular data on. Charging does not take long at all, I use a fast charging brick that supports 18w fast charge so it charges for me in a breeze. The charger it comes with is awful and I suggest you replace it/ have a new charging brick ready for when you order this phone. (Check Amazon). Connection: I haven't had any connection problems. I just downloaded Google messages from the play store because I used it with all of my phones and all of my messages were backed up and ready to go with ease. The phone connects to 5ghz wifi, NO WIFI CALLING that I know of right now, and no nfc but these are not deal breakers for me. The phone has a head phone jack and the single firing speaker on the bottom sounds pretty good. Also, by the USB type c charger there is a notification light right above it which I thought was a cool/neat feature. 4g LTE Network on the T-Mobile Network has been great with no dropped calls, call quality is crisp and clear. 05/21/19 Hey everybody üôÇ Just want to update on the use of the Xiaomi Redmi note 7 that I'm still using. It has still been a great phone! Battery life is great, and the fast charge feature to support fast charging up to 18w is an impressive and much needed feature. All apps run strong including Social media, YouTube, Netflix, and many others. I can scroll through the internet with multiple windows open and the phone just does it's job perfectly fine with no hesitation. Gaming: when it comes to gaming this phone does well, it does tend to stutter here and there playing PubG but that's expected from this phone. Connectivity: I still get really good service everywhere I go besides in large buildings like a warehouse, I lose service at almost every Walmart, Target, and Fry's, that I go to but connecting to their free WiFi with my VPN network I use allows me to still be able to use the phone if needed,but that can definitely be from the lack of Bands needed (even though the seller is saying this has band 4 and a couple other major bands needed for T-Mobile, don't believe it. It doesn't come with all necessary bands you need for the U.S. but it still gets the job done perfectly fine. Just Google your phones model number and you will see exactly what bands come with the phone. I have also been told by others that when they try to call me that SOMETIMES it forwards them straight to voicemail. I have done my research and it seems as the lack of Bands needed can cause your phone to not be able to receive calls or text messages in certain areas (maybe certain dead spots in your home or around town). This is not a deal breaker for ME by any means though, it doesn't happen often and when it does I receive a notification that I have a voicemail or I receive a text rather late (up to 10 min from what I calculated when my girlfriend text me to help her grab the groceries and she stormed in the apartment mad üòÇ). Could be that she has an iPhone though lol But all in all besides these small cons, the phone is still worth $200, compared to what else you can get at that price range. If you don't want to spend $1,000 on a phone then consider this one of your options. It's reliable,fast,great battery life,awesome cameras and 4k@30fps recording capabilities. You won't be disappointed folksüòÅ",264,"Xiaomi"

"1973","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","After a week's use Redmi Note 7 redefines what budget android phones can do. Once you can see what this phone can do, its really hard to imagine forking out $1k for a phone that some of the other known name brands make. Xiaomi is a very popular brand that makes really good phones and this one is great value for the money. GSM, two sim cards although you lose one for a micro-sd card, super nice and big display, blazing fast (Snapdragon 660 in a budget phone like thsi!!!) and great storage capacity. Several people have asked whether it works with T-Mobile. Certainly does and I get LTE as well. What's confusing is how T-Mobile labels their Bands and how Xiaomi labels their bands. If you do a side by side comparison of the actual frequencies this phone supports and what T-Mobile supports (see added pictures), only a couple bands are missing but all other frequencies are supported. I called T-Mobile support and they told me it will not work but I compared the frequencies, and bought the phone and it works like a charm. Battery capacity is great, left with about 50% after a full day's use* - your mileage may vary. I am not on the phone constantly. Call quality is great, takes great pictures and video. Note about setup. Follow XDA Developers posts on how to set it up with no ads, although if you choose your region as Europe or US, usuall ads are disabled. I use a different launcher and dont tend to use the system default apps and have permissions set to very light for system apps.

I thought this is the most worthy phone under $300 until I knew that Xiaomi launched the Pocophone F1 last year which uses Snapdragon 845 with 6GB RAM and only costs you $289! But F1 is ugly, and its camera can't compete with the GM1 camera in Redmi Note 7. So, if you are a phone game lover, just go for Pocophone F1, you will love it.

The phone UI is quick and responsive, some of the add ons can be a little annoying but with a few clicks that is all turned off. US Carriers - This will work great on AT&T and T-Mobile in the US. I personally have this running on Metro PCS (By T-Mobile) and it is running full voice service and LTE data. YOU WILL NEED TO CALL THE CARRIER TO HAVE THIS ACTIVATED. It even says so on the box. It was a fast 5 minute phone call, just ask them to add a phone through BYOD (bring your own device) they will know what to do!

The mi 10 UI is fine you can tweak the phone the way you want. Why pay hundreds of dollars for a flagship US phone, when these under dog phones are going unoticed. The camera is amazing as well. I would definitely recommend this phone to all my friends. It's a good phone at a good price not breaking the bank.

I can say, the Note 7 has an amazing camera and makes me wonder why i waited so long to get it. I love this phone. Its fast, has an amazing camera, and a battery that has lasted me for over a day, even with a lot of heavy use. I used to charge my phone a couple times for a 8 hour day at work, now I don't even have a charger at work. After an 8 hour day, including a lot of surfing, media streaming and watching videos at lunch, i come home with 60-70% battery life.",4,"Xiaomi"
"1990","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","If you‚Äôre looking to cut down on your phone bill or tired of iPhones, this is what you get. I went through the trouble of selling my iPhone X to switch to this and I have 0 regrets. Made a profit on top of buying this device. So far this phone has exceeded my expectations. It is a lot lighter than I expected from the size of the redmi. The plastic trim connecting the glass isn‚Äôt that much of a shocker considering the price but that shouldn‚Äôt be a deal breaker either. The fact the phone comes with a case gave me a little extra piece of mind because the glass surrounding it is gorgeous. The phone is snappy for the most part. The only time I come across a problem with the software is when I open the camera app. It kinda slows down the phone a bit especially when switching through apps. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs the transitions. Also, trying to connect to Bluetooth devices is a bit weird. I had trouble connecting to two different Bluetooth devices in the house(still managed to connect tho) but it wasn‚Äôt as quick as other phones. Took me a good 3 min to figure it out. The speaker should satisfy most people imo. And the screen is crisp and clean. YouTube premium has been a dream on this. I don‚Äôt think this phone has the HDR feature for Netflix like other flagships do tho. The UI gestures is pretty well done and the camera is pretty good. It‚Äôs no pixel but it takes some pretty decent shots. I‚Äôll keep updating as the time goes by. Be aware tho, I paid extra for 1 day shipping on June 1st and didn‚Äôt receive the phone until June 6th. Regardless of that giant mistake(as I was phoneless for a week and missed work opportunities) the phone is so good I‚Äôm not going to worry about it. You shouldn‚Äôt either.",4,"Xiaomi"

"1994","B07PY52GVP",3,"true","I've had the Note 7 for a couple weeks, and here are my observations thus far. Please note that this review was originally glowing, but was edited after some trouble. The Good: *The Camera - excellent. Probably the best camera I've used on a smartphone, especially a budget smartphone. *Battery Life - With very heavy use, this phone lasts all day with battery to spare. With minimal use, two days is no problem. *Overall Performance - This phone runs games apps very efficiently, and is very snappy. *Value - For the price paid, this phone is an incredible value. I find it to be one of the best phones I've owned overall. The Bad: *Bad SMS app - The default text messaging app is poor, in my opinion. Particularly if you engage in group texts... If you receive a 'group text', it gets divided out into individual messages, and you can't even see who all received the message unless they reply back. This is a limitation of MIUI from what I understand.... However, there is a workaround. I downloaded a free app called 'Textra' to replace the stock SMS app, and it works flawlessly so far. In fact, I like this app so much that I might start replacing my stock sms apps with it from now on. EDIT: This app, after a couple weeks, either becomes ad-supported or you can purchase it to keep it ad-free. *Cell reception problems - I've added this as an edit, and its a BIG deal. This phone is having some issues with cellular reception, particularly when its left sitting for a while (i.e. at night when I'm sleeping). I discovered this while on call for my work. I missed several important calls, and never knew anyone was trying to reach me. Upon finding out via email that people had been trying to reach me, I checked the phone... It showed a couple bars of service, but when I tried calling out it said 'no network available' or some equivalent of that. After a reboot, I could make (and receive) calls again... but not until the reboot. This happened multiple times during my on-call week, and caused me grief at work. I have to say... even with all the cool flagship level features of this phone (and there are many), I can't use it if the most basic part of a phone doesn't work right. This is affecting my livelihood, and it looks like I'll be trying to return it. It is a shame, because other than that it is a GREAT phone for the money :( Sadly, after finding that the most basic phone functionality is flawed, I'll be attempting to return this device. If anything changes, again I will update.",1,"Xiaomi"
"1995","B07PY52GVP",4,"true","So funny story... I ordered this item with 2 day shipping, hoping to get it before a flight out of the states... Of course it reached late so I had to get someone to pick it up and carry to me 2 weeks later... Amazon just told me the package was delayed and that's it... Sometimes paying extra and not getting what you pay for leaves a sour taste in your mouth .. I'm trying not to take that out on this review... The phone is great. A little heavy for most, but just right for me. Screen is vibrant, keyboard and Swype is smooth. Stereo speakers are awesome. Only hitch is the battery life on max brightness won't get me through the day. I bought this phone for work - which is loaded through Google Docs, Sheets, Drive...etc... So those functions well on the 4GB Ram, but won't last me the day. So still have to piggy back on my BLU Studio XL... Another reason for the purchase was the camera, which is just simply perfect for my floral shots. That's needs it's own review but posted some shots on Instagram @melvernpowell. So battery life and shipping are the only gripes, but all in all a good buy.",2,"Xiaomi"
"1996","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","Of course this phone isn't a Flagship device, but for the price range.. it is a flagship device. Very snappy, pictures look good, video is nice. I'm on Cricket in middle Tennessee (AT&T GSM) in a very rural part and on my other phone, it was struggling keeping at least a 4g signal and always backed down to 3g. The Redmi Note 7 is staying locked to LTE unless I go in the house and then drops to 4g. Not really a problem but this phone looks like it supports at least 2 of the LTE bands that cricket carries so this is an excellent sign. On my Son's Xiaomi A2, he has to go into the secret menu (*#*#4636#*#*) and change the band to LTE/GSM to get LTE to lock. Phone is way lighter than my Galaxy Note 2 and as soon as I got it, ran the updates and updated all the software. Phone sound quality is great. Phone calls are crisp and sounds great to other people. I've heard people complain about the brightness of the screen but that's not a problem. Coming from the Galaxy Note 2's AMOLED screen to this screen is def. different but you get used to considering you saved yourself a lot of dough. It's no wonder Xiaomi is on the come up, if they keep producing phones like this, they'll become a standard. --EDIT-- I see a few comments saying that they get a lot of ads. I haven't gotten a single ad yet. Still have the stock rom. I've considered unlocking the bootloader and putting LineageOS on it (XDA Devel) but why when the phone is buttery smooth, the OS is just right. Battery life on it is insanely great.",1,"Xiaomi"
"1997","B07PY52GVP",1,"true","*Update I DID like this phone. It streamed games and videos good. It's basically just a Chinese knock of Samsung A7. I can't stand the messaging. You can't group message as a separate thread. Really annoying you can't respond to them. And the recent phone calls doesn't show the time you made or received the call. Just the duration. Also annoying. And the ultimate deal breaker was the screen. Deep gouges from having my keys in the same pocket for a very short period of time. Then I tossed my phone and missed my bed. Landed on the carpet not badly. But shattered the screen making it unusable. Would not buy again",3,"Xiaomi"

"2021","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","I won't go too in-depth with this review, but I will say that after a few days of using this phone, I'm quite satisfied with it. It's fast, I've not experienced any lag. It's super smooth as well. Battery does drain a bit fast if you've got either data or wifi on, but I suppose that's every phone. To make up for that, it also charges super quickly. It's also got some pretty cool features. Only slight issue I have is that the charging lead for it isn't like that of other androids. What I loved about having android phones is being able to charge them with virtually any other android charger because charging lead is the same for all. This phone isn't like that, the charging lead is a bit wider. Strange though, my sister also has a Xiaomi brand and it uses the same charging lead as a typical android phone, so it's interesting why this one is different. This isn't a deal-breaker for me though, but it might be something to consider. Overall, great phone, a super great deal for such a cheap price and I definitely recommend it. If you want a fairly fast and good smartphone with a quality and expensive feel to it, but don't want to blow 600+ dollars on it, absolutely go for this one.",1,"Xiaomi"

"2113","B07PY52GVP",5,"true","07/29/19 My iPhone 6+ 64G smartphone, bought on Dec 29, 2014, began showing ""Touch Disease"" two years later. It got progressively worse and by the spring of this year was essentially unusable. It behaved like a daemon was randomly poking the display almost all the time. Only two things worked: it could still make calls, and after a few moments of flickering YT videos would usually play without problems. Apple refused to fix it and an independent repairman would have charged me $150 with no guarantees that it would work when he was done. I paid over $700 for that phone and was determined that I would never 1) buy another Apple phone and 2) never pay that much for a phone again. I would put that $150 into a new, better phone. Since last spring I've been checking around for more economical smart phones but while they were cheap they weren't getting good reports from users. A week ago I saw a YT video about the Remdi Note 7 and researched it. The reports and YT videos were raving over it. The AT&T rep said all I had to do was pull the SIM out of my iPhone and plug it into the Note 7. I purchased it and it arrived last week. I plugged my iPhone into my Kubuntu laptop and pulled off all of my photos and videos. I pulled the sim out of the iPhone and plugged it into the Note 7, and I had phone service. The ""LTE"" and signal bar appeared at the top of the screen. (Interestingly, even without the SIM my iPhone could send and receive text messages through the Internet.) The Note 7 had better connectivity in places where the iPhone signal strength was weak. I noticed that for certain features Xaiomi wanted me to sign up for a MUMI cloud in China, but those features are not important enough for me to do that. Instead, I put all the MI apps into folder and out of the way and relied on the Android 9.0 Pie interface, which is great. I've been using Linux for over 20 years and in many ways Android shows its Linux roots. Like Linux, I don't feel as handcuffed with the Note 7 as I did with the iPhone 6+ and IOS 12. I am currently perusing the Google Play Store for a good terminal that will give me a CLI. This Note 7 is considerably faster than my iPhone 6+. When I touch my finger to the sensor my fingerprint is read instantly and the display snaps open instantly. Apps appear almost instantly. Easily two or three times, or more, faster than my iPhone. My wife and I were watching a YT movie on the Note 7 and she mentioned that it would be nice if we could watch it on our 42"" smart TV. I turned on BlueTooth and it almost immediately listed our TV. I OK'd paring and there the video was, sound and all. That's going to happen a LOT more in the future! :D I was going to get a case for it but the silicone case that came with it is more than adequate and makes the phone easier and safer to hold on to. NOTE OF CAUTION about the charger: The wall charger is made for European electrical outlets. If you are in the United States you will need to get a USB charger rated at 5V and 2 amps. Note the amperage. TWO amps, not one. Most USB chargers are 5V=1A. So far I've used it less than a week and couldn't be happier about it. Money well spent. Sometime in the future I'll update this review to report how the phone is holding up. EDIT:. 8/15/29 I bought the Note 7 on 7/25/29, about 3 weeks ago. If I could give it 10 stars I would. I completely disabled AND stopped all MUMI apps, especially the ""peel"", when I discovered that it allowed remote control access. I replaced the MUMI cloud with Google's Drive, and it's browser with Firefox. The phone works great with Amazon's Echo dot and the Alexa app. All my smart devices and my Kubuntu laptop communicate easily with the phone. When the daemons start dancing on my wife's iPhone 6 it will get replaced with a Note 7. 8/8/19: Installed the Android SDK platform tools on my Linux Kubuntu 18.04 and enabled the developer mode, which allowed me to turn on USB debugging. That allowed me to use the Android debugging bridge (adb) to ""pull"" files from the phone and to ""push"" them onto the phone. After a month my amazement of the phone continues to grow",1,"Xiaomi"
"2114","B07PY52GVP",3,"true","This phone would connect to AT&T when first set up but as soon as you move to another location in a small city with AT&T service, it would disconnect over and over. People would tell me that my service was disconnected when they called me and data would simply stop working at any given moment. It was just not feasible to use this phone as a daily driver so I am returning it. DO NOT listen to ""top reviews"" that claim this phone ""works on AT&T"" because while it will connect to a couple of bands when you turn it on with an AT&T SIM, it will disconnect as soon as you go farther indoors, leave the house, go to work, etc. In other words, the statement ""works on AT&T"" just means ""it may connect from time to time, but won't work reliably on AT&T!"" These phone listings on Amazon should come with a disclaimer informing users that just because a phone is described as ""working with (insert carrier here)"" does not mean it will work most of the time. Overall, it's a good, solid phone with the best hardware you can find for under $200 , but it is NOT accurate to say it works with AT&T when it doesn't connect to AT&T most of the time. AT&T users should stick to getting AT&T branded phones if they want a working phone because phones like these, advertised as ""works with AT&T"" do not actually work as you would expect it to.

The back is plastic, you can hold it without fear of it slipping out of your hand like the 'fancy' BS glass backed phones. MiUi Gestures make the phone crazy easy to navigate. I've never used fingerprint sensors, or face recognition before, because it's always to slow, this phone is seamless and I have both options activated. The S10 was akin to waiting for my kids to do the dishes when using either, and a lot of butt texts of inappropriate pictures were sent to my wife on accident because the dang thing would unlock in my pocket. Best phone I've ever owned, and I highly recommend this for businesses that need a good phone, that doesn't break when you slip it in you pocket.

"2177","B07Q26V49K",4,"true","The phone is a great budget phone. I give it 4 stars because there is a feature that is lacking and that is WiFi Calling. I did research into this phone on battery, screen, speed all physical hardware things that one does research on and assumed that all phones can do WiFi calling, but certain phones like the Note 7 doesn't come with it. My office is in the basement of a building with WiFi access, that I used my previous phone with, but with the Note 7, I can't use WiFi calling in the basement, still can do texting but no cell calls. I'll have to try to use other options like Google Hangouts. I'll keep the Note 7 as it is a great budget phone but not having WiFi calling, I may have gone with my 2nd choice in a budget phone if it had WiFi calling.",1,"Xiaomi"
"2178","B07Q26V49K",4,"true","First of all, it was delivered really fast. It took only two days when it was supposed to take 5 days without paying extra or having prime. It came with a charger and the adapter for USA and also with a simple case which was great. The phone is amazing for the price, it has little details like VERY few times it crushes or an audio message couldn't be heard. But for the price is amazing, the camera is good specially if you use the 48mp pro function. The selfie camera is also good. The sound is amazing, loud and clear. It's also very fast and easy to use. I like how big it is and the screen is great. It works well with T Mobile. The battery is good, it last me the whole day and I use it like crazy since 7 am to 11 pm. I only have to charge it at night. I've been using it for 3 weeks and for the price it's outstanding. The only issue is that as I've already said, very few times it crashes in different aspects (can be screen, audio or system). Another detail is that when it's on full screen, sometimes it's difficult to touch the corners' buttons (like for example if you're watching something on YouTube, the options are hard to press).",2,"Xiaomi"

"2181","B07Q26V49K",4,"true","This is my first Xiaomi/Redmi phone and its a pretty sweet piece. Things that aren't as good as my previous phone (blade zmax) are touch sensitivity I mainly notice when typing so it could just be SwiftKey isn't a good match? Too early to tell. The battery and/or screen time is great. It's 9:40 pm and I've been driving with GPS on all day and I still have 20% left and well over 6 hours SOT. I was a little annoyed with the navigation keys but thankfully they can be replaced with gestures I.e. swipe left to go back, swipe up for home and swipe up and hold for recent apps...plus you get the added screen real estate with the buttons gone. I downloaded Google Camera and without getting super technical yet with settings it takes great pics, I'm anxious to try night mode. Fingerprint sensor is much better than my last phone, very accurate. Screen scrolling is buttery smooth, I'm sure all these new Xiaomi phones will have an edge but for me I'm not ready to plop down $3-500 on a phone. One other thing I like about this is the width, my previous phone in hindsight was a little too big. I can actually reach across the whole screen when typing without potentially/probably dropping it. Another negative is I do lose coverage and data in some locations and/or buildings. I'm on Metro in the northeast. Most of the time though there are no issues and lte is readily available. For the price it beats any Metro phone you'd get in the store imo. *edit* after more use I got it down to 11% and got just about 8.5 hours SOT that's pretty impressive and I haven't even unlocked/tweaked it yet.",5,"Xiaomi"

"2185","B07Q26V49K",2,"true","Almost every single app this phone comes with has ads. The music player (which has hardly any options by the way), the video player, and the file explorer all have ads. It also has a few quality of life issues such as the screen being WAY too sensitive. Somehow when I woke up this morning my phone was on and was playing a video, even though it was sitting with the screen face down on a table. Maybe my cat knocked it somehow, but it was out of my reach. Also several aps have compatibility issues, mostly with the lock screen. Audible and several music players I tried to replace the default with wont show on the lock screen. You cant change how long the screen is on until it goes off, making it incredibly annoying if you have to do something for 7 or 8 seconds and have to type in your password again. The performance doesn't have any noticeable improvements from my old G5, but I also dont ask for a lot performance wise, so I cant really test this. Also, most of the cases for this thing are pretty bad, at least at the time of this review.

"2210","B07Q26V49K",5,"true","Do you want a beautiful looking slim phone that won't break the bank, has great battery life, an amazing camera, can play pretty much any game you throw at it?? Look no further! Xioami redmi note line of phones offers what no other does, a balanced phone all around. Most companies when they produce phones you either get one or the other a great performing phone with a terrible battery, looks like a brick, or has a great battery but lacks performance and a terrible camera. Before this phone I had the xiaomi redmi note 3 which is quite outdated now but performed great for YEARS at a $200 price point offering just what this phone does but more up to date being 2019 xiaomi still meets my expectations this phone has just what you need a great long lasting battery that will go all day with heavy use, a good camera, and can run pretty much anything you throw at it no need to pay Samsung $1000 for the same thing. There is only one downside to buying these unlocked phones I have come across which is the lack of wifi calling using your normal cellphone number, this feature is only offered by phones you buy directly from carriers. I do have a work around though for people living in rural areas that absolutely need wifi calling, Google Fi. Google Fi let's you port your number to their service which gives you the capability of wifi calling, wifi texting, and also gives you the capability to make calls,text, view voicemail all from the hangout app on your phone or computer.

"2223","B07Q26V49K",4,"true","A couple of things about this phone that need to be kept in mind. This phone's hardware and software features are phenomenal. The camera works amazing with gcam, the speed at which the phone runs is amazing, you have about 50 gigs of storage after software, and battery will last you around 1 and a half days with regular use. Only issues I have is that the speaker isn't dual it's single, the bands of lte at which it can connect on in the US are minimal, and it doesn't have nfc. On the side note I'm connected with cricket wireless, and have had no issue with connection on mobile data. Tips with this phone for mobile data is to put the Sim card in the sd card slot until you change the IMEI number to the second port. That can be done on the phone. Second tip is that this phone takes around a day to lock a good connection with band 5 for 4g lte usage so if it doesn't work at first it's because it's establishing signal. You can also change preference to 3g which works just fine and is about as fast. I live in South Texas really close to the border of mexico, and cricket gives me a plan that allows free roaming in Mexico so I have that turned on so if your carrier plan allows free roaming I would turn it on just in case. Overall, ive had really good connection considering the limits. If you live in an area where band 5 isn't stable I would advise not buying this cellphone and getting something like a Nokia 5.1 which is just as good at a similar price point. I'm really happy with this cellphone however.",4,"Xiaomi"
"2224","B07Q26V49K",5,"true","This device offers flagship quality and features at a 'burner' price point. It has an excellent build quality. The back is made of Gorilla Glass 5, surrounded by a good quality plastic frame. The only issue I can see with the build is how slippery the device is - the glass back does not help with this. A grippy case will eliminate this issue. The hardware is great as well, I have not had any issues. The device runs as smooth as any high-end handset I've used. I do not play games on mobile devices, but based on benchmark scores, I'm sure this can play any mobile game you throw at it. The cameras are phenomenal - but held back by the stock camera app. Utilizing a third-party camera app like Open Camera or sideloading the Google Cam app will allow for 4K images and video that are not allowed by default for whatever reason. The battery life is one of my favorite features of this device - it has a huge 4000 mAH battery. This paired with good hardware and software optimization, allows the device to easily last all day. I go about 15 hours of regular use before plugging it in, usually having about 65 - 75% left. It should be said that the device does not come with a fast charge - compatible adapter, so expect average charging rates if you choose to stick with it. Overall, I love this device. I bought it to replace my relatively ancient 2014 Samsung Galaxy Note 4. At this price point I'll easily buy a new one every year.",1,"Xiaomi"

You will not be disappointed. I have MetroPC, which I joined after TMobile bought them. It works great with them. Go ahead and buy it.

Its my first Xiaomi phone! im a USA customer and im using it with TMOBILE in the USA (greater Los Angles Area). i have NOT had any noticable reception problems, despite missing a few frequency bands, it seems to work just as good as my tmobile note 4 and uocked Essential Phone. One thing though is that i am missing WiFi Calling (voice over wifi) but i knew that prior to buying the phone as it is a non tmobile phone. im loving this phone for $220 i think it is a super deal. the 48mp camera is on par with higher end phones, the picture quality is amazing. i came from a esential phone and note 4 and this screen/picture quality appears way better. i love the fact it has a IR Blaster and FM radio tuner! the blue outter shell case is very vibrant, it looks very nice but just a little too flashy for me, I wish i had bought the black one. The phone does come with a clear protective case but i upgraded it as the stock protective case it comes with isnt the best if your a person who drops your phone alot. The phone is fast, but i removed alot of bloatware as per instructions on XDA. I play a ton of newer phone games and they all run fine on the phone. ive gotten alot of complements on the phone as well from people and they ask what kind of phone it is! I tell them its a over seas china phone, which brings me to the fact that Xiaomi is a reputable company and i cant wait to unlock the bootloader and get on XDA!

It happened several times, so I kept having to have my charger nearby so as to not let it die. So I talked to Amazon and they did absolutely nothing because it was past the return window. They told me to reach out to Xiaomi US, and Xiaomi US told me they could not help because this phone IS NOT a US release. So I had to email Xiaomi China (because there is no phone number for them) and surprisingly they emailed back telling me how to fix it---the method was a headache. I ended up doing nothing and it just kind of fixed itself during one of the hard resets. They said this was possibly due to a bad phone update or something that was not installed right during an update. However, during all this I emailed the seller and.......crickets!.....never heard back from the seller. Oh but otherwise, the phone works fine.

"2365","B07Q26V49K",4,"true","So I did quite a bit of research before buying this phone because I had never used a phone from this company before. I pretty used samsung all my life but I didn't want to pay another $1000 for a new phone. First of all it is a great phone for the amount of money you spend. I looks good in this color, my friend felt the same way. Con The only con about this phone is the camera. It is not even close to what the review videos say or the company claims. Forget 48mp, which is hoax, pull up any youtube video and you'll see that in reality the camera is more like a 12mp if that. But I don't know for what reason it comes out worse than the 2nd phone I have which is a LG G5. The G5 came out in 2016 and it actually has a decent camera on it. So yeah to sum it up. If you want a nice smart phone for under $250 this is it. But if you are buying it because you like taking pictures then you'll disappointed.

"2427","B07Q26V49K",5,"true","I got this phone after having an LG V20 with replaceable batteries and it's been great. Have had this for a month and it's been great. Bought It for about 180$ Us dollars. My phone lasts all day fine. I usually go to work with 100% or 90% and it will be about 60% when I get back after an 8 hour day where I use my phone quite a good amount even with GPS or Bluetooth on. The camera is fantastic. Not like a pixel but for at this price it's great. It will def do the job if you're just taking casual photos for social media. I even take pictures for work and they come out great. Videos aren't as good but it's fine. The 48mp doesn't really do much. I don't use it much so I don't see a difference. Fingerprint scanner works like a charm and super fast unless ur fingers are watery/dirty. ONE CON I've had so far is that bc it's a xiaomi phone that's not that known it isn't fully supported by my cricket provider. It does work where I can call and text. But the find my phone doesnt find the Sim card since it's not fully protected. So u can't use that feature. And maybe some others. When I text people for the first time it doesn't show that I sent a text. It just ""dissapears"" and then later they will reply saying they got it but just later. But after the first text to someone new it works fine. Everything runs so smoothly and fast. I can scroll around and open apps so fast and smoothly. It's very beautiful. I got the blue/red one so the back looks beautiful but no my case covers it up. With the case people keep asking me if it's an IPhone tho. Everyone jokingly says it's a fake IPhone. But that can't be true or else my phone would have cracks on the screen and my battery would die within 2 hours. dropped it twice so far No damage.

Every time I would try to change the ringtone, it would give me an Error and does not play.

I have not used it a ton, but the camera seems amazingly sharp for a phone in this price range. Surfing the web has been seamless. Switching phones was a breeze since my carrier operates on a GSM network. While I can't give any specs, my experience as a user has been superior to what I expected from a phone in this price range. So far, I am thoroughly impressed and very pleased with this device.",6,"Xiaomi"
"2433","B07Q26V49K",5,"true","It is the best smartphone of the market.",NA,"Xiaomi"
"2434","B07Q26V49K",3,"true","So I've had this phone for about a month now. I think out the box, I would have jumped at the chance to review this phone a solid 5. There are days recently that, even at a great value, I want to chuck my phone halfway across the room. So I feel the phone is more solid than not hence my rating. Let's start with the positives: Value: This is what a solid 400-500 dollar phone should feel like. Fortunately you get it at 200. Most mainstream budget phones will not give you the amount of RAM that this phone provides. It's got a solid feel. Phone has been dropped 3 times already with no cracks to the screen. I'd invest in one of those gel foam type covers. It does one main thing. When your phone hits the pavement face down, it gives the edge enough of a buffer zone to minimize or prevent damage to your screen. Call Quality: This was the biggest drawback to my last phone Moto G and the single reason why i refused to buy a new one for this year. Call quality is solid. Pick up the phone in a noisy place and people can still here me without the use of a microphone type ear piece. Camera: The quality of the camera in my last budget phone (Moto G purchased 2 years ago) was absolute garbage especially in low light (to be expected from a budget phone). I don't know how this company did it, but they managed to pack a quality camera into this price range (maybe Privacy is the exchange for it all). I've been watching shows with the lights off and I've managed to capture quality snapshots of the shows i'm watching even zoomed in. Alright now to the drawbacks (and they may be dealbreakers for some of you) User Interface: Absolute Yuck. I've gone from an Amazon Firephone 4 years ago to a Moto G 2 years ago to this phone AND the last two phones took me about a week to get used to the Interface that is used. Such is not the case with this phone. Notoriously difficult to naturally navigate through programs. There are usually a step or two extra that you have to take to toggle between programs. There is a crap ton ofbloatware. The cleanup feature i do enjoy but I could do without everything else Default Web Browser: After about a month, I have ZERO clue how to make Firefox Mobile my default web browser. Everytime someone sends me a Twitter link or a link of any sort through text message and email, the phone will use its own web browser to open up the Link. Wouldn't be such a big deal except for the fact that I'm usually signed in to Twitter and Youtube through Firefox. I tried following directions online to no avail. No option to make Firefox my default web browser AND no option to uninstall this garbage of a web browser. Sound: Probably the single worst phone I've owned when it comes to sound quality. It's not even how well or unwell i hear someone on the other line or a video on Twitter. It's in the fact that the sound range is wildly inconsistent. One time I have to adjust the volume all the way to high to be barely able to hear someone....few minutes later that person's voice is piercing in my ear and now i have to adjust the sound volume down. Same with videos. Really you can forget about watching anything without a good set of headphones. Even then though, you constantly have to be adjusting the volume level up and down. Reception: Don't know what the band rating is but this phone's reception has been less impressive than with my last two phones. I am on the AT&T network. When this phone goes down to one bar, forget about it! You just lost a call. I've never looked down on my phone, seen one bar, and then go back to full bars without dropping the call. And yes this phone seems to go down to 1 bar plenty. There is a stretch of highway that i take every week. Just for the heck of it, I took my Motorola Phone and used it this past week. It held steady in that stretch of highway while on the phone. This phone will always drop my calls and lose reception there. Battery Life: Don't know if this is so much on the phone than it is on my programs so I add this to the negatives with a BIG CAVEAT. Brought most of my previously installed programs over from my other phone. This phone was holding charge for 2 days straight with consistent usage. Once these programs started updating, my battery life slowly strted to deteriorate. Now It's still a full day of solid usage before I charge BUT it's now half of what it used to be. Again BIG CAVEAT may be the programs i'm employing may be eating away at Battery Life because same problem existed in my Moto G a s new updates kept coming out. So there you have it. It's a 200 dollar phone. If Value and Call quality matter to you then this is the right choice. Bloatware and such an issue, stay away from this and defn get yourself a Motorola or wait until u can get a refurbished Pixel 3G for around the same price.",2,"Xiaomi"
"2435","B07Q26V49K",1,"true","I ended up returning this device. First, its connectivity on T-Mobile network isn't solid. It's missing the support for band 71, so LTE support is limited.

I loaded Google Messanger and Google Contacts and disabled the manufactures default software.

This model does not have NFC, which I don't need as I have a Samsung watch. If you do need NFC there are other Xiaomi models that have it at a slightly higher price.

The phone is also very fragile and slippery to hold. The case it comes with is ugly. It looks clear but as soon as you put it on your phone it turns murky and hides the phones beauty.

The camera setup is really solid, especially if you download the Google/Pixel camera app. Despite not being OLED, the screen is really great looking. I like the teardrop notch design, and hardly notice it when in full-screen. The speaker sound is pretty good, and acceptably loud for a single bottom-firing setup. Also, headphone jack and IR blaster included like a bonus. USB-C and quick charging need no further explanation. The 4k mAh battery lasts a full day easily even through heavy use and a lot of gaming. It's surprisingly zippy and responsive even when running multiple apps. I get good coverage on Cricket/AT&T and get LTE most of the time here in the U.S. (DFW). I don't love MIUI, but a third-party launcher solves most of my gripes, and I don't notice any lag running the launcher. Fingerprint reader on the back where I like it, and it works great and fast.

So I took it to both a repair shop and the T-Mobile store. Conclusion: the speaker is defective. So the phone is worthless because the cost to replace is more than the phone. The store suspects that there was a faulty run with a bad part on the factory assembly line with maybe 500 to 2000 phones that got packaged up and they can't sell to re-sellers like AT&T or T-Mobile or Vodafone.

"2501","B07Q26V49K",5,"true","Basically the best value phone you can buy. Front camera is bad and rear is pretty good. Fingerprint scanner is fast like all xiaomi. Speaker is nothing special. 4000mah battery gives insane battery life, at least 10hrs screen on which ends up lasting me over 2 full days average on a full charge using Bluetooth earbuds for music and YouTube videos and Twitter or web browsing etc. Notch is very pleasing imo. Camera protrudes a bit from frame but not too serious. MIUI is as good as ever. Getting LTE bands with T-Mobile northeast US. In terms of screen, slight backlight bleed on top edge nothing crazy, bottom bezel is a lot larger than I realized but still overall good screen to body ratio. Fairly bright quality display but it's not oled, budget phone for a reason. One of the big differences between mi9 is plastic sides, but the note 7 feels ""premium"" and other than the lower conductive properties of plastic vs metal you can't really tell the difference. Very satisfying feel in hand but it's a stretch to reach top corner even with larger hands. Not Thanos approved(slightly top heavy) Obviously structural integrity is weaker but you can see durability tests, so don't go hitting this with a hammer. Gorilla glass 5 is some serious stuff though, and mine's already survived multiple chest high drops without a scratch so far.

This phone delivers. The display is crisp and clear, and very responsive. It is a little on the heavy side, but i am fine with that as it feels like i'm holding something solid in my hand. The camera takes great pictures so far, but i haven't tried it in every condition, nor will i likely ever do that. Dual sim worked for my brief experiment, with a both US and CDN sim cards.

First things first this phone is 100% worth the price. The screen is nice, the camera is amazing and it's just as fast as your 2017-2018 flagships. The only problem I've found so far is the battery life. It's not terrible but it's also not the greatest. I'm a heavy user so I usually get about 4-6 hours on a full charge. The screen is big enough to watch whatever you want on it. Netflix, YT whatever. However it takes some getting used to with the corners being rounded. I'm in the Midwest and I get pretty good signal wherever I go so that's a plus. This phone runs on gsm (at&t) towers so make sure your sim is compatible before you purchase.

There's a really nice blue to purple gradient when it hits the light. I won't get into the specs etc since others have already done so and done well. Pic attached was taken with the phone in portrait mode after installing the Google/Pixel Cam APK. Pics taken outdoors are coming out very nice! Haven't had the great quality with photos taken indoors in low lighting but I'm still figuring out all the settings so could be user error. Battery life has impressed me- I am a pet sitter and needed a good battery as I'm taking well over a hundred pics a day and tracking walks with GPS. Battery lasts me all day easily. I use the quick charge cable that came with my Stylo 4 as it didn't come with one. My biggest concern when I bought this phone (global version) was that it only supports 2 or 3 bands on TMobile and I was worried I wouldn't get LTE but I've had no issues at allalthough I do live in a city that has good coverage from TMobile. I was initially on Metro PCS then switched to Mint Mobile and have had no issues from either MVNO. From what I understand issues may arise if you travel to or live in a rural location but I haven't yet tested out that claim therefore can't report on that. Finally- the dual SIM really came in handy when I was trying out a new carrier.

Function: It is Android 9 (Pi) with Xiaomi cumbersome skin. Had to delete out some useless apps. Screen: Excellent for its price and it is comparable to my wife's iPhone XS Max that costs 6 times more than this one. Speed: To start up an app like Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Walmart, Google News, YouTube, or others, each takes about 3-5 seconds. That is quite fast compared to my old LG phone (4-cores with 1.3ghz CPU), which takes about 6- 10 seconds to start up each app. Battery: From 8am to 5pm with 100% charge of moderate using of those mentioned apps, I got 52% left. It is great for the battery to hold out that long. Phone and speaker: Phone with Cricket service is adequate. I don't talk that much anyway.

"2525","B07Q26V49K",4,"true","I took a chance on this phone after reading great reviews. It lives up to the hype. I only deducted one star for 2 reasons. The software can use some enhancements - which will maybe happen over time. One small example is the method in which you delete your call history. It's not straight forward or easy if you want to select a couple of lines to delete. They got it right with text messages. And speaking of text messages, you have to long press and click on more details if you want to get the time stamp of a particular message. Also while using gorilla glass 5, I expected the screen to be more scratch resistant. I've acquired a couple of small scratches already in the first month. My last Huawei phone, I had for almost two years and didn't get a scratch. I'm not hard on phones - I dont even know how I got these scratches. Time will tell about the screen.

"2530","B07Q26V49K",5,"true","Got this phone a week ago and was hesitant to leave my review so fast. Wanted to take my time and see how it would be considering it's my first time using a Xiaomi device. Got it to replace my Honor 8 and old Note 4. Have to say all my expectations and time spent researching the device and how it was going to work on T-Mobile etc paid off. This phone is amazing. Speed wise... It's VERY FAST! Doesn't slow down or hiccup at all no matter what tasks you do. Snapdragon 660 surprised the heck out of me. Throught it was going to run slow.... Nope! This processor is awesome. The Redmi Note 7 runs like a flagship device. Period. Camera takes very nice picture but transforms into a BEAST camera taking breathtaking photos using the free GCam app from the Pixel 3! The fingerprint sensor is the fastest I've used on any phone even faster than the Honor 8 and THAT sensor was ridiculously fast. Not sure how Xiaomi got away charging 200ish for all you get for this phone. The battery life is the best of any cell phone I've used. I've gotten 2 days average use between charges as advertised. But I've also gotten something they did not advertise.... 10.5 hours screen time between charges.... Not 10.5 hours of light use.... No.. 10.5 hours of web browsing, YouTube videos, 2.5 hours of calls, some pictures in between, social media etc... Normal stuff most people don't with their phones... Things that would kill my other phones at about 5-6 hours screen time on their best days... This device chews through like nobody's business. Reception with T-Mobile is awesome in the Chicagoland area. No dropped calls at all. The screen quality is also very good as well. It's gets bright, can be viewed outside without problems, has nice color/contrast and great viewing angles The speakers are loud and have clear sound. I find the MIUI software okay compared to Samsung's One, EMUI and iOS. Coming from any of those devices (Samsung, Huawei or Apple), you should have no problems working your way around MIUI. Once you discover using gestures to navigate, you'll wonder how you got around using other phones off the past. My device updated to MIUI 10.3.5 when I took it out the box. There are some privacy settings you'll probably want to turn off. Take time to go through the permissions and settings. Most you can turn off for privacy sake without affecting the functionality of your apps. Once you have your phone dialed in to your liking... Watch out. It becomes a very fun device to use daily. Watch Flossy Carter's Frankie Tech and TechUtopia's review of the Redmi Note 7 on YouTube. They're probably the best and most accurate reviews you'll find. Once you see them, buy this phone with confidence! It gets 5 stars from me",112,"Xiaomi"

"2554","B07Q3T41M4",1,"true","When I first received this phone, it worked great: fast re-charge, good battery, beautiful display and great signal. However, after 6 weeks of use, it just suddenly stopped receiving signal. It was working, I set it down on my desk, then when I went to check again I had no signal. It's as if the radio hardware inside just ceased to function. Of course, I tried the myriad of things you can look at online to recover from such a situation: - check for updates - restart the phone - toggle airplane mode - remove and re-seat the SIM card (card works in another phone I checked) - try a different SIM port - toggle 2g only - reset to factory defaults Even emergency calls do not work. I've owned several phones over the decades and I've never had a phone just completely stop working as a phone, the PRIMARY job it has. The worst part is that there seems to be absolutely no ability to return this thing or get a replacement. Any support channels tell me I'm out of luck, so buyer beware. You're on your own and this phone has a lot of known issues around connectivity. Just search for ""Redmi note 7 no network"" and buy at your own risk.",1,"Xiaomi"

"2681","B07Q6ZZ4S1",2,"true","Where do I start.... I use straight talk plan. The last phone I had which was a moto g5 plus worked well with it. Not the case with this phone... the signal I get with this phone has drastically declined. Areas I used to get good signal I don't. And sometimes places I should have no problem getting signal at, I will sometimes randomly have nothing at all. Other times it shows I have signal but nothing will load. I have issues with Google maps working on this phone. Loses GPS signal frequently and randomly. Will put me in places I am not, or always ALWAYS thinks I turned or took whatever exit I was passing and had to constantly re calculate just to realize I was still on the same route I was supposed to be on (which on a number of occasions because of this, it has made me miss the actual road or exist I was supposed to take). If I want to post a picture on IG or send one in a message, the photos I just took are not at the top. I have to hunt through all of the photos on my phone to find them. Will place my picture all in random order at times too. The camera takes... Ok pictures. Not great. But if you want to take multiple pictures in a short amount of time? Forget it. You can get one picture taken, click the bottom to take another one and it won't. Have to wait (too long in my opinion) before it'll let you take another picture (which let's be honest, by that time most moments have already passed and you've missed it. So hopefully you get a good one the first time around) .. A lot of the apps I use will pretty often freeze and crash. I bought the phone because the price was good, and I liked the better camera then I had with my Moto g5 plus, but in the end I didn't notice much of a difference. I absolutely loved my first smart phone, the HTC oneM8. I used that thing for years until it just wouldn't hold a charge anymore. This phone I've have for 5 months and I regret buying .. unfortunately these things did not happen during my allotted return time or else I would have sent it back. It's a cheaper phone. It's pretty.

"2690","B07Q6ZZ4S1",5,"true","Just as good as I thought it would be. For those of you wondering, it does support LTE band 4. This phone has a premium glass feel, responsive, plenty of storage for my use, and 4 GB RAM is enough for all my uses. Unless there's a 4K screen, and you're doing 4K gaming on a phone, there's no need for more than 4 GB RAM. I haven't had any slow down when using the 48 MP camera. It also records videos at 60 fps, which is nicer than 30 fps. If someone's going to complain about the camera, then they shouldn't be taking pics with a phone, that's what a dedicated camera, such as a DSLR is for. The battery life seems typical, last me more than the whole day during my typical daily use. Since it support quick charge 4, I ordered a quick charge 4 wall charger the other day. In my opinion, this is the best bang for the buck. People around me recommended the Galaxy s10, but I guess they don't know that they're just paying $900-$1000 for a slightly better CPU, more RAM, slightly better camera, and a 4K Screen. I'm like Dude, ""I rather save the $1000 and fly to Hawaii""...lol...",42,"Xiaomi"

No 4K video Slow motion max at 120f/s Face unlocking is ok Fingerprint scanner is fast Using without any cover - less or no fingerprint in the back glass. Full screen (with notch) videos for Netflix, Prime videos and YouTube. FM signal is weak inside home outside is fine. You can record FM songs - great out-of-the-box feature. Multitasking is a little lagging, but not too bad so far. Good battery life with regular use (few videos, songs, picture, browsing) - not checked with any game.

"2692","B07Q6ZZ4S1",5,"true","I'm using this in place of a perfectly working Galaxy S9+, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. Most people don't like the MIUI interface, but I've always been a fan. I did have to take a few extra steps to remove the ads throughout the interface, but once that was done it has been a very pleasant experience. Make not mistake about it, it is definitely not on the same level as the Galaxy S9+ with regard to processing power, speed, and camera quality. However, with all of the perks provided by the MIUI 10 interface (with the still impressive ""sort of 48 MP"" camera), it as served me just fine on AT&T's network in the American Southeast.",21,"Xiaomi"

The phone is fast and the camera is unbelievable for quality and options at this price point, the finger print reader and facial recognition both word flawlessly. For the amount of memory and the options this phone should cost a lot more but it doesn't and thats a huge bonus over the Samsung and Apple products. I have owned an iPhone, Galaxy Note and currently use Samsung for work but i would gladly take this handset over any of the others just on performance and price.

"2701","B07Q6ZZ4S1",3,"true","For $186 this phone is fantastic. UPDATE REMOVING STARS After several months with this phone there is something so annoying because it cannot be avoided - Xiaomi sold ad space in their UI of Android. There are pop ups when you use the built in apps like browser, cleaner, file manager, et al. It is so very annoying. What a horrible idea to sell ad space within the UI.

"2703","B07Q6ZZ4S1",5,"true","I've had this phone for a couple of months now so far I love how easy it was to start the phone and use the phone.

I love that there is so much space on the phone and even though some of the in bread apps are annoying I have found quite a few of them useful and still use them. as far as reception I have not had an issue with getting a service I have straight talk I have traveled with in the continental US with no issues with service however I have not traveled outside of the US to tell you how the service is outside of the US. I recommend ordering a case if you are clumsy with your phone I've had this phone for a couple of months and just now ordering my first case. I haven't had any mishaps but I do have one scratch on my screen so there's that. overall for the price you get very good value you get a decent working phone without breaking your pockets it will definitely suffice if you need a newer version smartphone without the flagship price tag.

"2715","B07Q6ZZ4S1",5,"true","First, the good: This is an awesome phone for the price. The 48 MP camera is incredible, the fingerprint reader works nicely, and the speakerphone quality is the best I've ever heard. In addition, the MIUI version of Android (don't worry -- Google Play Store is installed and the phone runs all the normal apps) provides a level of visual customization simply unavailable in any other brand of phone. The bad: First, this phone does not receive GSM Band 12, which means you'll likely be limited to carrier speeds of 5 Mbps or so. Having said that, I can listen to music and watch YouTube videos without any problem. Second, the camera sticks out rather far from the back of the phone and the included cheap case doesn't extend out that far, which means you risk scratching that beautiful camera every time you set your phone down on a table. The first time I used this phone, I immediately bought a third-party case that protects the camera (they're available on Amazon for less than $10) and I suggest you do the same. For me, those two small drawbacks were not enough to lower the rating to four stars. This is an outstanding phone for the price and is highly recommended!",7,"Xiaomi"
"2716","B07Q6ZZ4S1",3,"true","A beautiful phone, super fast and great value for money. But while I love it, I also HATE it. It's hyper-sensitive. Even after attempted adjustments. I wish I were an agile fingered youth, who can whizz around any tech like lightning. But I'm older, I'm used to iPhones, and I'm generally in a hurry when I do things. If one accidentally touches the screen or even the very edge of the screen of this deice, it immediately DOES SOMETHING. It either dials someone, or changes a setting, but something you don't WANT it to do. Also, the ""On/Off"" button on the side is extremely trigger-happy (sensitive) and is placed in such an awkward spot, that if you don't specifically pay attention every moment during a phone call, it's natural to touch it and cut the call. I guess after some time and paying specific careful attention to everything one does, it's possible to get used to it.",3,"Xiaomi"

"2744","B07Q6ZZ4S1",5,"true","This phone is part of a wave of Chinese phones that will help end the crazy Samsung and Apple prices. I got the 4GBs of RAM and 128GBs of storage model. 1. I have a OnePlus 6T. Those phones are known for speed. This phone doesn't feel any slower -- despite having a definitely slower Snapdragon. I'm sure in gaming it makes a difference but in everything else this thing is SNAPPY. 2. The bad news is lacks an AMOLED screen. The good news is it almost doesn't matter. You have to have a discerning eye to see the difference. In other words -- GREAT screen for the price. 3. Basically everything is good on this phone, except for -- 4. -- the MI software. It desperately wants your information. It tries to trick you to use their messaging app, their mail app, their contacts app. Just like Samsung. Like when you go to install an app from Google Play, a Mi 'security' app inspects it first. I'd like this were it not that it tries to trick you to download a different app during the process. So you'll have to hit Google to make it stop doing this. And learn how to make Google apps default. This is a major nuisance for naive users, but doable for experienced types. 5. The camera is a surprise. See my attached photos for a comparison between my OnePlus 6T camera and this phone. I would say the 6T is better, but not by much. I properly shows a bedroom lantern without washing it out. It recreates details of my cat's hair better. But if you look at the picture of the shelves, the photos on the shelves are sharper and the wall color is more accurate. Considering that 6T was more than twice the Note 7's price, that's pretty good. And get this: the shutter speed is FASTER on the Note 7. 6. The case that comes with it is an empty gesture. It's way too thin. When you buy a case make sure it protects the camera bump. 7. My charger is Euro with an adapter. It's kinda crazy big. If you're going to keep this phone (which you likely will) I'd recommend finding a cheap alternative charger. Word online is it supports up to Quick Charge 4 but 3 is recommended, since it will put less 'stress' on the battery while charging. 8. I had Cheap Chinese Phone Anxiety in the sense of build quality. I finally found someone on YouTube dropping the phone without a case. Go to YouTube and search for this ""Redmi Note 7S | 7 (Global) Durability Test (DROP SCRATCH WATER BEND) | Gupta Information Systems."" He's not speaking English but it doesn't matter. Get about halfway through and wince like crazy as he starts dropping the phone... again... and again... and again... without a case. Spoiler: it did really well. Overall: a WOW for this price.

So unless you buy directly from them and are located in China, they do not honor the product warranty.

"2748","B07Q6ZZ4S1",4,"true","Had issues receiving texts when I first got the phone(didn't receive any at all) and incoming, and at times outgoing, calls were spotty at times, but after replacing the SIM card, waiting a day to see if it would work, and doing a hard factory reset, I am finally receiving texts. There's a catch though; if I change the phone's theme, it stops working and I have to restart the phone to fix the text issue again. Phone calls are also seeming to come in without an issue as well (though this issue had improved prior to the SIM card replacement). Aside from this snag, the phone is great! The camera is a dream come true, crisp display, and runs smoothly. If it weren't for the strange text/theme quirk, I'd rate it 5 stars. Additional information: I'm a Metro PCS customer located in South Florida. As far as bands go, it doesn't seem to leave band 4. In regards to speed, it falls short of 4 LG but it's still faster than 3 LG.",2,"Xiaomi"
"2749","B07Q6ZZ4S1",5,"true","I Love this phone and I would find it much easier to list the things I don't like about it... There are only 2 things I don't like about this phone 1) The Fingerprint Reader does not work, other than the fact that I don't keep it locked so it's not a deal-breaker. However, the Fingerprint reader can be used to wake it and open the lock screen. 2) is the fact that there is no app drawer in the OS, which I feel is the only downside to the MIUI OS. I purchased this phone after much research and finally decided to go with the majority of the reviews I had read, having this as a replacement for my budget Samsung J7 is like night and day.",1,"Xiaomi"

"2751","B07Q6ZZ4S1",5,"true","I was all set to buy the 64gb model of this phone new from Amazon but then noticed it was being offered in ""Used- Like New"" condition - but the 128gb model (so twice the space) from a third party but with fulfillment by Amazon (meaning it would still be eligible for Prime Shipping). Ever since I moved, I've had issues with products arriving, arriving on time or arriving without being damaged but alas, the pull of the free two day shipping is quite strong. The phone was shipped by the seller on Monday & I ended up receiving it the NEXT DAY! I've only had the phone since Tuesday and today is Monday but it's no exxaggeration if I describe myself as ELATED. First off the appearance: This phone is just undeniably gorgeous. I got the blue model and it's so lovely that I deeply regret having to cover it with a case! The manufacturer kindly includes a complimentary CLEAR, silicone case with your phone & I believe that is with the purpose of allowing the feel, lapis lazuli like Jewel tones to be visible. I appreciate the inclusion, and i may use the case as a back up but for someone like me who is clumsy and tends to drop their phone often, there are lots of durable, SHOCK PROOF case which I ordered ahead of time so I wouldn't be taking any chances. The specs on this phone are just out of this world for the price! 48 MP camera? Thats's like twice the MP's of my son's super nice DSLR he got for Christmas! The phone is also packed with a decent amount of RAM & it shows in the phone's performance. It's extremely responsive. The keyboard is a dramatic improvement over my previous phone just going by how well it picks up on what I want to type whereas my last phone was a nightmaren for typos since my finger would occasionally brush against the key next to the letter or # I was intending to type: Not so with this Redmk!With the amount of RAM in this phone you could play online games easily. Mobile games aren't exactly my jam but hey, if they're yours look no further Other than that, the screen is brilliant and the size is perfect. It is a substantial ""phablet-ey"" the phone. Videos are nice to watch because of the quality of the image/screen and as I mentioned above the size is substantial with a weight to match. You'll feel it when you take it out of the box that this isn't just some cheap plastic garbage but a well made, durable phone.",1,"Xiaomi"

With the volume to Max and the speakers on, I could hardly hear the person on the other end. I had to bring the phone to my ear to continue the conversation. On my old Moto G4 I had to keep the volume below 1/3 or it was way too loud. Maybe the sound would be better with a headset, but I don't like to use ear pieces, so this is a deal breaker for me.

"2761","B07Q6ZZ4S1",2,"true","Updated Review, 2 Stars: November 1, 2019 I am very sad to have to update this review with my new opinion of this phone, and so soon after having left a rave review no less. A week or so after I left my original review (which was after I had been using the phone for a few months), my phone suddenly started displaying the pesky ads that MIUI is now known for. They had never been an issue on my phone until just this recently. I have no idea what changed, but it seemed to happen after one of the most recent updates, so I assume it must have been a broad sweeping change made to all their phones. I followed tutorials online about how to disable the ads, but unfortunately even though I have unticked the respective boxes in the various apps and settings... the ads still show. What's worse is that they are often 5 second countdown ads ensuring that you cannot immediately exit the ad and must watch for at least 5 seconds until you have the option to exit out. You can read up on Xiaomi's excuses for why they've decided to take this route... but they are weak, and this phone WAS perfect. It could have been so much more, and they have effectively ruined it to the point that I would suggest the cheapest Android smartphone you can buy at WalMart before I would suggest this one. It is an absolute shame. Original Review, 5 Stars: October 15, 2019 This is the greatest phone I have ever had. I've had several iPhones over the years. This is my first Android type of smart phone, and I am absolutely blown away. I could not believe the stark contrast between the iPhone, and this phone. How incredibly boring the iPhone is compared to this, and now I would assume any other Android phone as well. It's just so much more fun to use. I was totally in love with the phone for the first month I had it, and now I've settled into it and gotten used to it. But I still feel that twinge of excitement sometimes when I pick it up and look at the gorgeous display. It's so sleek and this particular color is absolutely gorgeous. It's fast, has a great camera, works perfectly well with Straight Talk. Everything about it wins on every level... I will never use iPhone again.",NA,"Xiaomi"

Was not sure when opening the package, written ""global version"" on it :-( But I confirm it's really a ** M1901F7H ** version (not a *G like gearbest sells). So it should definitely be OK with France FreeMobile operator, for instance. I wasn't sure when ordering, but in this case the product is conform to Gotham cells' description. Nice ! By the way, the little paper stating ""international version, so no warranty"" is a bit surprising... Shipped in France, had to pay 200‚Ç¨ including a tax deposit, and a few weeks later, I was refunded 0.75‚Ç¨ (wow ! ). So at the end I paid around 10‚Ç¨ less than buying it through FreeMobile After some weeks of use, it's a really nice phone, fast, and nice screen.

It has an amazing camera! it takes excellent pictures in good light and pretty good ones in low light as well (compared to other phone cameras). The 960 fps slow motion video is so much fun to use. Also, the ultra wide angle lens is great to have when taking landscape photos. The main 48 mega pixel camera takes super sharp and detailed photos with great color accuracy! And the third telephoto lens lets you zoom up pretty close, although with some loss of detail. A smooth fast phone experience and an excellent camera were exactly what I was looking for, but I got so much more with this phone. An excellent screen, the perfect size, Bluetooth 5.0, and NFC!

The screen quality is great (comparable to OnePlus 6t and anything else with an AMOLED screen), the camera is great and improves majorly when/if you download the GCAM apk for it. The speaker is nice and loud, not very tinny, and had some decent mid-range sounds to it. Bluetooth works great, it charges up nice and fast, feels good in the hand, face unlock works great and I didn't even have to set my region to India to get that to work. It's just a really really good phone all around and for less than $300 you really can't beat it. I've had several phones from Xiaomi and this one is quickly becoming one of my favorites, for sure. Buy it - you won't regret it",24,"Xiaomi"

(2 X Xiaomi Mi 9 Lite 64GB + 6GB Aurora Blue, for my Wife and I) My Order arrived on time right at my doorstep here in Sunny South Africa. (Super!

"2924","B07QCCW5KB",4,"true","This phone had high ratings and was a huge bang for the buck. It works. My first Android but, only for travel. Apple OS is still a much more refined, simpler and customer-focused experience (easier to use). Way fewer key strokes to navigate to your destination. With a little practice, this phone worked great for my trip to Iceland and Scotland. Big screen. Also, they provide a black phone cover which is soft and fits well. i wouldn't bother paying for another 3rd party cover unless you want a brighter color.",NA,"Xiaomi"
"2925","B07QCCW5KB",5,"true","Pros: 1. Battery life is awesome. I used to plug my old phone to a power bank everyday just to get through the day but this baby lasts all day and I have a long host of apps running in the background and constantly make Skype calls overseas. 2. Big screen and bright! 3. space for two sim card and a separate slot for microsd card. You don't need to sacrifice slots. 4. Sturdy. I've dropped it a couple of times already prior to getting screen protector and good case and nothing happened to it Cons: 1. For some reason Viber and other phone apps like textme, textnow, etc dont work on this device but I think this might be an issue with my carrier. 2. Right out of the box it's got too much bloatware and if you are not careful you might end up installing an app by accident. If the phone came with just Android 9 this phone would be perfect. 3. Picture quality is good but I am not a photophile, which if I was I'd be buying a whole separate professional camera anyway.

I'm an iPhone user but I use this as my second device at home and when I'm traveling away from home (not every day commuting). How I use it: - Stream music using Spotify on to my Google Home speakers and Amazon Alexa. - Stream videos from Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video to my TV. - Keep a lot of stuff downloaded for when I fly. - Use the remote app to turn my TV on and off (using the built-in IR blaster) Pros: - Phone is great for the price, can't find anything better. - Expandable slot let me put a $20, 128GB micro SD card which let me make this a fully loaded media device. - Screen is big enough to watch stuff on when I'm traveling (e.g. on a plane) - Fingerprint sensor is great, fast, and easy to set up. - MIUI is nice and easy to use, doesn't get in your way - Android buttons for navigation can be removed and you can use gestures to make the phone feel like an iPhone X/XS! Cons (keep in mind this phone is less than $150!): - Some times a few apps will crash if you're trying to do too many things at the same time - Default launcher isn't great (I use Nova launcher) - Cameras are not the best but they are fine for video chatting, not awesome for photography.",15,"Xiaomi"
"2945","B07QCCW5KB",5,"true","Pros: Works as advertised, low cost, good price to performance. Excellent phone for the average users. Cons: No cons, it's a low end budget phone so don't expect high end features. If you want more, then you gotta pay more. Got this phone for my dad because I didn't want to spent much. This phone works just fine for him, he mostly goes on Youtube, makes calls, gets confused by emails and occasionally uses text. Review update: 9/15/2019. The 1st week of September my dad said the phone screen suddenly went black, the phone itself would not turn on. It was already over 30 days. I contacted Amazon and followed a few suggestions, but the phone still would not turn on. The Amazon reps via chat were helpful and sent a replacement. I received it Thursday 9/12/2019, prepped it, allowed the battery to fully drain to 0%, charged it to 100%, and now my dad is using it again.

This is a very nicely made phone with few drawbacks and many advantages. I was leery of the 720 pixels width, but text is sharp and nicely formed. Images are flawless. No, colors are not over saturated and the screen is not screaming at you. The MIUI version is nicer than my Loco Poco has; you not only can control the overall color balance, but you can also adjust the color of the text. And .... It sports a Dark Mode settings. Wow! Dark Mode has exactly the same contents, but it is in reverse. This is a regression really, but nicer on the eyes. Android is version 9, and OTA works: During initial setup, the system upgraded itself and one application updated too. The dreaded advertising is not there, either.

"3061","B07QK32C8M",4,"true","I love this phone *for the price* - you get a full 1080p screen, a whole lot of storage, a headphone jack (thank goodness.) But I take major issue with the camera, the way the camera is marketed, and its performance. Not to get too in depth here on technicalities, but we generally use a pattern in the world of imaging called a Bayer pattern. This alternated photosites between having a red, green, and blue filter over each, and the key is that no color next to each other is the same. That allows for processing called ""de-Bayering"" or ""demosaicing"" to resolve the image at one photosite per pixel. Well the ""48 megapixel camera"" camera may technically have 48 million photosites, but they're quadrupled up in color meaning you only get 12 megapixels of performance. In fact, due to spacing between photosites and how that limits light sensitivity, you actually get worse than the performance of a normal 12MP camera. This was clearly done mostly for marketing reasons which is really disappointing considering the image this makes isn't particularly great- and when you open up the camera app it looks like a joke to call it 48MP. A shame on an otherwise fantastic phone.",20,"Xiaomi"

"3066","B07QK32C8M",3,"true","After doing a bit of research I decided on this phone to replace an hold Honor 8 that I‚Äôve been using with Metro PCS. My first impression is that the hardware was excellent, especially at this price point and the proprietary operating system was a bit buggy, but that wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker for me. Pros: Excellent battery life Good cameras, especially at this price point Fast finger print reader Decent build quality Cons: Does not support many U.S. LTE bands (cross check with your carrier) Screen brightness is good, but the screen is very reflective making it difficult to see in bright light Screen appears to have a polarizing filter, meaning if you are wearing polarized sunglasses you will NOT be able to see the screen when holding the phone horizontally. This is very inconvenient, especially for taking horizontal photos on bright days. Audio quality when using headphones is not as good as other phones I have owned Intermittent issues with vibration alerts Proprietary MIUI works well enough but it can be buggy and inconsistent at times After using it for a few days I started to notice a few of the issues noted above that I unfortunately just can‚Äôt get past so I will be returning the phone. For me, the biggest issue is band compatibility for Metro PCS. I‚Äôm not very well versed in mobile lingo but I read many reviews that stated it worked well with Metro. I would say it works okay but I found that it did not work as well as my old Honor 8. After doing a bit more research I discovered that Metro operates it‚Äôs LTE service on six different bands. This phone only supports two of those six and the Honor supports three of the six. The one band that the Honor supports that this one doesn‚Äôt is band 12, which I understand helps with cell reception indoors and in some rural areas. I like the phone enough that I would be willing to accept the other flaws I mentioned but the poor reception compared to my old phone is a deal breaker for me.

I have only seen a couple of oddities. It doesn't use Android share for direct phone to phone file sharing, Redmi has its own app and it doesn't work on all Androids. However, I never in my life used that feature so I suppose I can live without it. I can't remember any other out of this right now, they were as unimportant to me as that one. Also, a couple of apps didn't work right after being transferred through the nearby phone thing when I first set it up. AIO for one, and color note. But all I had to do was uninstall and reinstall, and I don't think that was because of the xiomi phone I think it was just the way those apps are written. I was also hoping for an Android one phone and this one isn't; however there is little bloatware and I think it is pretty close to stock.

I do find some of the controls are a little harder to use at first, but I've mostly gotten used to them. Works with T-Mobile, which I currently have, though I have a bit of trouble with the network.

I actually returned another phone that was about the same price which couldn't even handle Elder Scrolls Legends. That phone was maybe 30$ less . The only bummer is the lack of headphone jack , but Xiaomi includes and adapter in the box. The case is a nice bonus too. Wireless charging using my old S8's charge paid works fine. Still have to test out NFC. Edit: NFC is fine Note : The only issue I've found is Chromecast volume control.

Xiaomi should just use pure Android. The default camera app leaves a water mark on all photos by default, but it can be turned off. The MIUI apps like the camera app can't be uninstalled. There seems no way to turn off charging sounds other than deleting the audio files. Not only that, but the charging notification sound plays even when you have sound off. If you using the phone while charging or have a weak charger it will constantly go off. There just these minor headaches because the customization are not thoroughly vetted as pure Android.

The Pixel 3A didn't have the same deal I got it under 2 months ago so I sort of defaulted to Motorola. Came across this on Amazon and was somewhat skeptic at first. Started reading up on it and saw some great reviews. It had more then what I needed and seemed a little big for what I like (I prefer the size of the iPhone, that's really my favorite feature of the iPhone) but then again so are all Android phones these days and seems like everyone likes those so figured let's give it a shot. Order it before lunch, arrived before dinner same day. I just set it up and it's a really nice looking device, like it even better then the OnePlus 7. I don't use covers with my phones but the cover that came with it I actually will be using that, it fits so seamlessly and doesn't seem cheap in anyway. Complements the device really well. The UI is not what I'm used to and will use a 3rd party launcher as a work around. It's a little hefty for people who care about that, but I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a device even if your budget is around the $500 mark I think you'll enjoy this device more then what's available in that range even. The only comp I can think of is the OnePlus 7 which is a great device but not the bargain value it used to be. Edit: the UI is easy to get used to if you've ever used an iPhone since it's just the missing app drawer that takes some getting used to.",14,"Xiaomi"

Premium build quality so pride was put into the build. Flat front screen so no curved display. If you don't like curved display you're good to go here.

This phone is fast, I installed Asphalt 9 and it runs smooth without any lag. The camera is very good, selfies are excellent (I still enjoy the popup camera effect), the big screen experience is marvelous while you are watching a video and the display colors are so vibrant. Battery life is amazing too, I've spent almost a whole day with one single charge surfing on web, using Whatsapp, Instagram, watching some Youtube videos and Netflix. My final score is 4.8/5 because the quick charge is not as fast as I experienced with my old OnePlus 5, however nothing in life is perfect! 100% recommend!

The main LTE band in my particular area around my house is 12. I also get band 2 and 4 but they are shotty at best. So with the phone only being able to support particular bands and not 12, I was not able to get full LTE. I really wanted this phone to work out for me. Like I said, the phone is beautiful. When I was outside the phone was fast and the picture quality was good. I hope that Xiaomi is able to make US compatible phones that support all LTE bands. I am a little jealous of the people that get to use their phones without issue. Hope this review helps the people that don't really understand what all that techy stuff means.

Super amoled screen brightness and colors Fast charging Andorid one software and fast updates Cons Screen. Yes - the response was very here and there. Sometime it wont response no matter where u click. Plus the screen is 720p HD, why a step back MI ?

"3388","B07VB9MMMW",5,"true","Canadian buyer here: I'm using it on Public Mobile (Telus network) and it started working as soon as I inserted the SIM. Here are some thing I was worried about before purchasing: 1. Screen resolution. I read a lot of reviews complaining about the 720p display, but I honestly can't see any individual pixels. I'm coming from a MotoG4 Plus with ove 400ppi, but I can't tell a difference in the screens because of the lower resolution. So, if you are worried about the smaller screen resolution you can remove that item from your list of to-worry-about items. 2. Finger print reader. Yes, It seems a bit slow. And by that I mean it take about 1 second to read the fingerprint and display the unlock screen. In the first days it also felt like it was not recognizing my fingerprint about 1/2 the times. However, after a few more days, that percentage has gone up to more than 90%. I think this is just me getting used to place the finger in the right spot on the screen. 3. Amoled screen It's nice that you can get an AMOLED screen for this price, however I am disappointed that it lacks the most important functionality (from my point of view). That is: display at least the clock, and possibly notifications when the screen is off, ESPECIALLY when you move the phone. (take it out of pocket or just move it if it sits on the table). I got used to that feature in my old phone and it's a shame this one doesn't do that. It does display the fingerprint sign when the screen is off and you move the phone, so putting at least the clock on the screen as well would have been super nice. Other than that, the camera is amazing, call quality very good and battery life is also impressive! I think you get a lot of feature for the money with very few compromises. So far I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",18,"Xiaomi"

The phone itself has a lot of good features like great battery life and a nice rear camera. The 720p resolution doesn't bother me at all but the fingerprint scanner can be wonky at times.

But there is an easy remedy that I provided in the comment to the previous review: Try this to fix the problem: 1) Settings - Network & internet - Mobile network - /Your SIM card/ - Advanced - Preferred network type - Select there 4G/3G/2G 2) Settings - Network & internet - Mobile network - /Your SIM card/ - Advanced - Automatically select network - OFF 3) Settings - Network & internet - Mobile network - /Your SIM card/ - Advanced - Network - /Select your provider best network (4G?)/ 4) Settings - Network & internet - Mobile network - /Your SIM card/ - Advanced - Network - Access Point Names - Try by yourself or call your provider to find out which one to use. For T-Mobile ""fast"" works OK. Once this was done - no dropped calls. There are usually three main complaints: a) low screen resolution - not an issue unless you use a magnifying glass b) Weak CPU - really? I find it satisfactory and I do not use the phone to play games, strictly business. c) Slow fingerprint sensor. Yes it is not the fastest, but speed is OK and it is always on, even if motion sensing is disabled. There is no NFC and no OIS. But I compare picture quality to Mate 10 Pro and I like realistic colors more. Sharpness is on par, except for the very edges of the picture. And it does not lie with selfies - just clean and sharp picture. I have an impression that it fixes wide angle distortion for selfies too. What I really like is the OS - Android One is a pure joy, absolutely no bloatware, and first update that I received upon first power-on wiped out two custom apps from Xiaomi, this is such a rarity to have a clean android from the start. Battery life is exceptional. During night time it uses ~3% and battery can last for 2-3 days with ~40 apps that I have installed. Then why is it 4 stars? Because there are better phones at 3-4X higher price and with this phone you still need to change some settings to guarantee no dropped calls and repeat these settings after each OS update. So you choose.",21,"Xiaomi"

"3402","B07VB9MMMW",5,"true","First this phone has the bands for AT&T and T-Mobile and sound quality is crystal clear and speaking of sound quality the external speaker sounds amazing plus it has a headphone jack! Honestly, I can't find anything to complain about, this phone is not only gorgeous, it feels extremely premium with its rounded edges, and beautiful design. Absolutely this has the same level of quality as much more expensive brands, and it's much nicer than my son's mi6 ( which is also great, btw) The case is the one that comes with every Xiaomi phone for free, and it fits very snugly. However, I would suggest buying a better case. It seems that Xiaomi bent over backwards to give us the best phone that they possibly could at this price, and I don't see how they do it! FYI: I am somewhat of an expert with phones and have or have owned practically every brand that you could name, and I am also into the hobby of using custom rom software. But with Android One, there is absolutely Zero need to root the phone. Because there is no bloatware whatsoever on this device. Also the software is pretty much the exact same software you will find will on a Google Pixel...pure AOSP and no bloat. Although I love Xiaomi's other OS ""Miui"" the performance of this device is so flawless, that I would not change a thing. Xiaomi has really hit a homerun with device, and I sincerely hope that they make a strong push for doing business more business in the US. This phone was built by a company whose priority is creating a high-quality device and giving the customers exactly what they want. If you buy this phone, I would strongly suggest using the Mi Community app, to find the answers to any question and to take part in a global community of Xiaomi fans who freely help one another with any technical questions and you will find all kinds of nice, free addons. Software With Android One, you can expect to see updates quickly. In fact there was September update that included the September security certificate, that downloaded immediately after I setup the phone. The update installation took 5 minutes and the phone rebooted without any issues whatsoever. With Android One you can expect regular security updates, and, in my experience, frequent updates are one of the things that Xiaomi does frequently. it's one of the reasons that I have become so very passionate about Xiaomi and the love that they show their customers by providing timely updates, quality products, at such a low price, and I cannot say that about any other android phone manufacturer. Top notch features This phone has an Amoled screen that is visually sharp and color perfect. In fact, it's hard to discern differences between this screen panel vs the screen panel from my higher resolution Xiaomi Mi8. Fingerprint unlock is built into the front panel and it unlocks fast and responds immediately, plus you also have the option of using face unlock. The adapter is a US adapter, and the phone uses USB C which is another nice perk! The phone comes with an remote control IR blaster, which was an unexpected very sweet feature, and the screen is very bright when using the phone outside, at 530 nits.To go on, Gamers can expect their games to work well with this device and although the phone is not Xiaomi's flagship, it does have an Antutu score of a very respectful 145,000. Next, you can expect about 11 hours of SOT (Screen On time)! With the A3's larger battery and efficient display you will definitely get well beyond a day‚Äôs use of regular use. The charger that comes with the phone charges at 10 Watts. However, the phone is actually capable of charging at the faster speed of 18 Watts ( AKA: Quick Charge 3.0). Although, it's much better for the phone to use the lower watt charging, because less heat will extend the battery by years. Camera is Fantastic!!!!!! Yes, this camera is outstanding, see the photo above of the sky and trees, pretty nice! The camera has every option you can imagine. I would suggest turning on the AI (Artificial intelligence mode) which will automatically choose the correct setting depending on the subject and available light. The camera on the front and back of the phone are stellar. You can shoot photos in the raw or use the wide array of filters. In conclusion, you should absolutely buy this phone, now before the price goes up! This review is my honest opinion. But I will admit that I do love this highly ethical company. I am absolutely certain that you will not find a better phone than the A3 at this price point. Frankly you are essentially getting a better-looking Pixel 3A at a much lower cost and that is a fact! Finally, I strongly recommended buying from Amazon, I am a longtime customer and anytime that I have ever had an issue they addressed and resolved it immediately. Enjoy!",5,"Xiaomi"

"3404","B07VB9MMMW",4,"true","First time trying to buy a phone from Amazon. I had a Samsung S7 edge beforehand. Using this with Google fi. Pros: price, battery life last for 2 days, fast OS, Android one is amazing, camera quality has potential Cons: camera is slow meaning motion blur is extremely sensitive and it also has a delay on capture. I've attached some pictures I've taken. I have extremely steady hands but there is still some blur in the picture of the flower. Bluetooth connection is spotty - it works but there is often interference. AUX output is lower compared to my Samsung and I don't know how to fix this. I had to exchange my first one for another because it had some video issues (blue bands on the image). It was performing slower than reported and had SD card issues. This new one doesn't have the same problems. I've attached pictures of the difference in speed. I've had this model for a couple weeks and it is getting just a bit slower according to the speed test app I use but I haven't noticed a change in use. Will update if anything changes.",3,"Xiaomi"

"3406","B07VB9MMMW",5,"true","The phone is pretty nice. I bought the phone at $190, and then a little over a week, it was below $180. I could have waited, but I did not because I killed my last phone. It feels very solid for being a ""budget phone"", but the quality is pretty awesome. The downside of the A3 is that I miss my first phone by Xiaomi (which made the transition from iPhone a lot easier), which was a Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus. Now that phone made me happy till I broke it- completely user error! This one is not as wide, and seems slightly smaller in width, but is obvious when holding it. The con of this phone is how I must max the brightness when I am outside. If I don't, it's like looking at your phone when you first wake up and you are trying to figure out if you woke up late, just constantly squinting. Anyhow, that is my biggest issue which runs into my last issue with the phone... Because Xiaomi lacked in the screen resolution, maxing the brightness on the phone causes your battery to drain quicker. Never had an issue with my beloved Redmi, and could go on without a charge for a whole day even after excessive use. This phone can last the whole day, but that's as long as I am not doing the most.",1,"Xiaomi"

"3411","B07VB9MMMW",5,"true","I've heard all the complaints online: the resolution sucks, the finger scanner sucks, the screen brightness sucks. A: You cannot tell this has a 720p resolution, and the phone runs SMOOTH. Period. B: The scanner works well, IF you give it the correct placement. It's guilty of being very sensitive. That's a good thing. C: The brightness can need adjusting in the daylight, that I will not argue. But it's manageable. The battery? Amazing. I've pushed this thing with graphic intensive apps, and by the end of the day, still had somewhere around 70% of the battery left. I mostly use for phone and text. But if you have apps that stay on in the background, like twitter or other social media energy vampires, expect it to go faster. And the camera is awesome. Going from a Acatel Idol 5 to this, it's like night an day. It's not going to wow Photography aficionados, but to the rest of us, this camera screams to be used. The three lenses (48 megapixel main, 5mp width and 2mp depth) help create a smooth and detailed shot. Warning: you better get yourself a really good screen protector if you're a serial klutz. This screen cracked with my BESTALICE case for the Mi A3, and when the protector cracked, it gave me a hairline crack to the actual screen. If you treat your phone like you treat your laundry, look elsewhere. This phone is not designed for careless people.",NA,"Xiaomi"

The main camera is the same one as on every other Chinese flagship and a steal at the price, add a capable wide angle shooter to that you have a winner.

Great against scratches but sucks against shocks. - Cannot run OR will open and close certain apps (yousician, kindle, etc) I'm assuming the ram isn't good enough because it worked flawlessly on my previous phone (huawei mate se). - Sometimes the low screen resolution will be a bit annoying and I'm assuming intolerable if you watch lots of videos or play games (but would you even be able to play games on this if I can't use some regular apps...?)",1,"Xiaomi"

I would say for the most part yes, it's way too slow and works only with all the right conditions(like perfect position of finger, very clean finger and even sometimes it fails).

A: You cannot tell this has a 720p resolution, and the phone runs SMOOTH. Period. B: The scanner works well, IF you give it the correct placement. It's guilty of being very sensitive. That's a good thing. C: The brightness can need adjusting in the daylight, that I will not argue. But it's manageable. The battery? Amazing. I've pushed this thing with graphic intensive apps, and by the end of the day, still had somewhere around 70% of the battery left. I mostly use for phone and text. But if you have apps that stay on in the background, like twitter or other social media energy vampires, expect it to go faster. And the camera is awesome. Going from a Acatel Idol 5 to this, it's like night an day. It's not going to wow Photography aficionados, but to the rest of us, this camera screams to be used. The three lenses (48 megapixel main, 5mp width and 2mp depth) help create a smooth and detailed shot. Warning: you better get yourself a really good screen protector if you're a serial klutz. This screen cracked with my BESTALICE case for the Mi A3, and when the protector cracked, it gave me a hairline crack to the actual screen.

Dual SIM or expansion slot, but who needs it at 128gb storage. The lower res screen hasn't been a bother to me at all and the screen is rather easy to see on sunny days. The IR blaster sounds gimmicky but I find it to be a very useful addition. I've owned the mi a1 and 2, xiaomi seems to make quality phones. My only real gripe for the phone would be The charging port and headphone jack are on opposite ends of the phone. Finger print reader isn't on par compared to my a1 and my camera app gives me a crash notification after I plug it in 75% of the time (doesn't seem to effect the camera but the notification is annoying).

The main LTE band in my particular area around my house is 12. I also get band 2 and 4 but they are shotty at best. So with the phone only being able to support particular bands and not 12, I was not able to get full LTE. I really wanted this phone to work out for me. Like I said, the phone is beautiful. When I was outside the phone was fast and the picture quality was good. I hope that Xiaomi is able to make US compatible phones that support all LTE bands. I am a little jealous of the people that get to use their phones without issue. Hope this review helps the people that don't really understand what all that techy stuff means.

"3606","B07VD3JH2C",4,"true","Previous reviewer states it drops calls. Yes it does, because it is unlocked version and for whatever reason it sometimes locks to wrong carrier. I do not know whether it is the carrier who allows phone to connect or the phone itself. But there is an easy remedy that I provided in the comment to the previous review: Try this to fix the problem: 1) Settings - Network & internet - Mobile network - /Your SIM card/ - Advanced - Preferred network type - Select there 4G/3G/2G 2) Settings - Network & internet - Mobile network - /Your SIM card/ - Advanced - Automatically select network - OFF 3) Settings - Network & internet - Mobile network - /Your SIM card/ - Advanced - Network - /Select your provider best network (4G?)/ 4) Settings - Network & internet - Mobile network - /Your SIM card/ - Advanced - Network - Access Point Names - Try by yourself or call your provider to find out which one to use. For T-Mobile ""fast"" works OK. Once this was done - no dropped calls. There are usually three main complaints: a) low screen resolution - not an issue unless you use a magnifying glass b) Weak CPU - really? I find it satisfactory and I do not use the phone to play games, strictly business. c) Slow fingerprint sensor. Yes it is not the fastest, but speed is OK and it is always on, even if motion sensing is disabled. There is no NFC and no OIS. But I compare picture quality to Mate 10 Pro and I like realistic colors more. Sharpness is on par, except for the very edges of the picture. And it does not lie with selfies - just clean and sharp picture. I have an impression that it fixes wide angle distortion for selfies too. What I really like is the OS - Android One is a pure joy, absolutely no bloatware, and first update that I received upon first power-on wiped out two custom apps from Xiaomi, this is such a rarity to have a clean android from the start. Battery life is exceptional. During night time it uses ~3% and battery can last for 2-3 days with ~40 apps that I have installed. Then why is it 4 stars? Because there are better phones at 3-4X higher price and with this phone you still need to change some settings to guarantee no dropped calls and repeat these settings after each OS update. So you choose.",21,"Xiaomi"
"3607","B07VD3JH2C",2,"true","I was hoping a winner with Xiaomi Mi A3 even with a HD screen. I went for it even after seeing average to mediore reviews. Here is what i found and why i returned. Pros Good Primary 48 MP camera. Other two rear ones are close to garbage. Smooth software experiance, was able to uninstall 1-2 bloat that came with. Super amoled screen brightness and colors Fast charging Andorid one software and fast updates Cons Screen. Yes - the response was very here and there. Sometime it wont response no matter where u click. Plus the screen is 720p HD, why a step back MI ? Battery life - even with 4000 + mah , avg life is mediocre , fast charging is there to save you Cameras - the ultra wide capture very less details and colors range less. Selfie camera even with 32MP less average details only. Also turn off the default beautification mode. Nevertheless, mine goes back just for bad responsive panel. Otherwise a very good phone in close to $200 range",10,"Xiaomi"
"3608","B07VD3JH2C",5,"true","First this phone has the bands for AT&T and T-Mobile and sound quality is crystal clear and speaking of sound quality the external speaker sounds amazing plus it has a headphone jack! Honestly, I can't find anything to complain about, this phone is not only gorgeous, it feels extremely premium with its rounded edges, and beautiful design. Absolutely this has the same level of quality as much more expensive brands, and it's much nicer than my son's mi6 ( which is also great, btw) The case is the one that comes with every Xiaomi phone for free, and it fits very snugly. However, I would suggest buying a better case. It seems that Xiaomi bent over backwards to give us the best phone that they possibly could at this price, and I don't see how they do it! FYI: I am somewhat of an expert with phones and have or have owned practically every brand that you could name, and I am also into the hobby of using custom rom software. But with Android One, there is absolutely Zero need to root the phone. Because there is no bloatware whatsoever on this device. Also the software is pretty much the exact same software you will find will on a Google Pixel...pure AOSP and no bloat. Although I love Xiaomi's other OS ""Miui"" the performance of this device is so flawless, that I would not change a thing. Xiaomi has really hit a homerun with device, and I sincerely hope that they make a strong push for doing business more business in the US. This phone was built by a company whose priority is creating a high-quality device and giving the customers exactly what they want. If you buy this phone, I would strongly suggest using the Mi Community app, to find the answers to any question and to take part in a global community of Xiaomi fans who freely help one another with any technical questions and you will find all kinds of nice, free addons. Software With Android One, you can expect to see updates quickly. In fact there was September update that included the September security certificate, that downloaded immediately after I setup the phone. The update installation took 5 minutes and the phone rebooted without any issues whatsoever. With Android One you can expect regular security updates, and, in my experience, frequent updates are one of the things that Xiaomi does frequently. it's one of the reasons that I have become so very passionate about Xiaomi and the love that they show their customers by providing timely updates, quality products, at such a low price, and I cannot say that about any other android phone manufacturer. Top notch features This phone has an Amoled screen that is visually sharp and color perfect. In fact, it's hard to discern differences between this screen panel vs the screen panel from my higher resolution Xiaomi Mi8. Fingerprint unlock is built into the front panel and it unlocks fast and responds immediately, plus you also have the option of using face unlock. The adapter is a US adapter, and the phone uses USB C which is another nice perk! The phone comes with an remote control IR blaster, which was an unexpected very sweet feature, and the screen is very bright when using the phone outside, at 530 nits.To go on, Gamers can expect their games to work well with this device and although the phone is not Xiaomi's flagship, it does have an Antutu score of a very respectful 145,000. Next, you can expect about 11 hours of SOT (Screen On time)! With the A3's larger battery and efficient display you will definitely get well beyond a day‚Äôs use of regular use. The charger that comes with the phone charges at 10 Watts. However, the phone is actually capable of charging at the faster speed of 18 Watts ( AKA: Quick Charge 3.0). Although, it's much better for the phone to use the lower watt charging, because less heat will extend the battery by years. Camera is Fantastic!!!!!! Yes, this camera is outstanding, see the photo above of the sky and trees, pretty nice! The camera has every option you can imagine. I would suggest turning on the AI (Artificial intelligence mode) which will automatically choose the correct setting depending on the subject and available light. The camera on the front and back of the phone are stellar. You can shoot photos in the raw or use the wide array of filters. In conclusion, you should absolutely buy this phone, now before the price goes up! This review is my honest opinion. But I will admit that I do love this highly ethical company. I am absolutely certain that you will not find a better phone than the A3 at this price point. Frankly you are essentially getting a better-looking Pixel 3A at a much lower cost and that is a fact! Finally, I strongly recommended buying from Amazon, I am a longtime customer and anytime that I have ever had an issue they addressed and resolved it immediately. Enjoy!",5,"Xiaomi"

For under $250 to get an in display fingerprint is a marvel, great battery life, easily a full day and a half with heavy use. The main camera is the same one as on every other Chinese flagship and a steal at the price, add a capable wide angle shooter to that you have a winner.

"3686","B07VD3JH2C",5,"true","Canadian buyer here: I'm using it on Public Mobile (Telus network) and it started working as soon as I inserted the SIM. Here are some thing I was worried about before purchasing: 1. Screen resolution. I read a lot of reviews complaining about the 720p display, but I honestly can't see any individual pixels. I'm coming from a MotoG4 Plus with ove 400ppi, but I can't tell a difference in the screens because of the lower resolution. So, if you are worried about the smaller screen resolution you can remove that item from your list of to-worry-about items. 2. Finger print reader. Yes, It seems a bit slow. And by that I mean it take about 1 second to read the fingerprint and display the unlock screen. In the first days it also felt like it was not recognizing my fingerprint about 1/2 the times. However, after a few more days, that percentage has gone up to more than 90%. I think this is just me getting used to place the finger in the right spot on the screen. 3. Amoled screen It's nice that you can get an AMOLED screen for this price, however I am disappointed that it lacks the most important functionality (from my point of view). That is: display at least the clock, and possibly notifications when the screen is off, ESPECIALLY when you move the phone. (take it out of pocket or just move it if it sits on the table). I got used to that feature in my old phone and it's a shame this one doesn't do that. It does display the fingerprint sign when the screen is off and you move the phone, so putting at least the clock on the screen as well would have been super nice. Other than that, the camera is amazing, call quality very good and battery life is also impressive! I think you get a lot of feature for the money with very few compromises. So far I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",18,"Xiaomi"
"3687","B07VD3JH2C",4,"true","First time trying to buy a phone from Amazon. I had a Samsung S7 edge beforehand. Using this with Google fi. Pros: price, battery life last for 2 days, fast OS, Android one is amazing, camera quality has potential Cons: camera is slow meaning motion blur is extremely sensitive and it also has a delay on capture. I've attached some pictures I've taken. I have extremely steady hands but there is still some blur in the picture of the flower. Bluetooth connection is spotty - it works but there is often interference. AUX output is lower compared to my Samsung and I don't know how to fix this. I had to exchange my first one for another because it had some video issues (blue bands on the image). It was performing slower than reported and had SD card issues. This new one doesn't have the same problems. I've attached pictures of the difference in speed. I've had this model for a couple weeks and it is getting just a bit slower according to the speed test app I use but I haven't noticed a change in use. Will update if anything changes.",3,"Xiaomi"
"3688","B07VD3JH2C",5,"true","Is one of the best phones price / performance, don't stop buying this phone just because people says that is HD+ (720p), iPhone XR has a 720 display and it is not AMOLED. The Xiaomi Mi A3 has: *PRO'S* 1. Good triple set up cameras 2. Construction materials 3. One of the best batteries on the market 4. Decent in display finger print reader ( it is not slow, but there are faster ones, tip use the face unlock feature, it is a life saver ). 5. Android one and an amazing performance 6. A really good panel with nice colors but... ( This one is also a con) CON'S* 1. Fast charging power brick not included in the box 2. The screen is 720p so pixel are noticeable, the maximum bright is not as bright as I would like to, the screen is watchable at daylight don't get me wrong, but I had higher expectations due the minimum bright is kind of high. 3. Speakers are loud and clear at 70 - 80 % however when reaches 100 % get distorted a little bit. 4. A very slippery phone (careful with that, use the included cover PLEASE ) 5. EUROPEAN CHARGER... I had to get an adapter to charge my phone, luckily I had one, keep that in mind.",42,"Xiaomi"
"3689","B07VD3JH2C",3,"true","This phone looks great and overall I can live with the lower screen resolution since I don't really play any games. The camera is also decent, even at night time. The battery life has been impressive. I can go a long time without recharging. It's flaws however: - Impossible to find a truly shockproof case for this. I ordered two advertised as such on Amazon and both were just silicon sleeves. Great against scratches but sucks against shocks. - Cannot run OR will open and close certain apps (yousician, kindle, etc) I'm assuming the ram isn't good enough because it worked flawlessly on my previous phone (huawei mate se). - Sometimes the low screen resolution will be a bit annoying and I'm assuming intolerable if you watch lots of videos or play games (but would you even be able to play games on this if I can't use some regular apps...?)",1,"Xiaomi"
"3690","B07VD3JH2C",5,"true","The phone is pretty nice. I bought the phone at $190, and then a little over a week, it was below $180. I could have waited, but I did not because I killed my last phone. It feels very solid for being a ""budget phone"", but the quality is pretty awesome. The downside of the A3 is that I miss my first phone by Xiaomi (which made the transition from iPhone a lot easier), which was a Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus. Now that phone made me happy till I broke it- completely user error! This one is not as wide, and seems slightly smaller in width, but is obvious when holding it. The con of this phone is how I must max the brightness when I am outside. If I don't, it's like looking at your phone when you first wake up and you are trying to figure out if you woke up late, just constantly squinting. Anyhow, that is my biggest issue which runs into my last issue with the phone... Because Xiaomi lacked in the screen resolution, maxing the brightness on the phone causes your battery to drain quicker. Never had an issue with my beloved Redmi, and could go on without a charge for a whole day even after excessive use. This phone can last the whole day, but that's as long as I am not doing the most.",1,"Xiaomi"

"3707","B07VPMYXST",5,"false","I got the Xiaomi A3 as a successor for a Xiaomi A1. The A1 was a fantastic phone for its price (a third of ""flagship"" phones from other companies) and the A3 is a worthy successor. The A3 improves on the A1 in several areas such as bigger storage (128 GB), better cameras (especially the selfie camera), bigger battery (4000 mAh) and faster charging (18W). It also has some more arguable changes like a OLED display instead of LCD (the jury is still out on which is better - each has different strengths) with a lower resolution (I was worried about the resolution, but in reality the resolution is good enough), fingerprint sensor in the front (I really loved the one on the back which was super-quick, but the one in the front is ok too...), and the glass instead of metal in the back. Thank god that after the wrong turn with the A2, Xioami kept the separate earphone jack in the A3 (although they moved it to the top of the phone). If you're getting this phone for your kids (which I wholeheartedly recommend), they'll love the stylish new look of this phone compared to the ""older"" design of the A1 - plus it has all those cool features the kids love to compare (your phone only has two cameras in the back? my A3 has three! I have 128 GB storage! your phone has those ugly bezels, mine doesn't!). One thing you should be aware of before buying this phone is the real story of its size. Xiaomi calls this a 6.1"" phone, which sounds significantly bigger than the A1's 5.5"". But it is NOT bigger. In fact, it is a smaller phone - it is narrower. Also its viewable screen area is smaller! The viewable screen is taller (without making the phone taller, because the bezels are gone) but it is narrower, resulting in a longer diagonal (this 6.1"" number) but a bit smaller screen area. There's nothing wrong with the bit-longer-but-bit-narrower screen but don't buy this phone expecting it's even bigger than the A1 - it is not. For better (easier to hold in one hand!) and for worse (if you were looking for a huge screen).",1,"Xiaomi"

"3752","B07VPMYXST",3,"true","I'm a big Xiaomi fan and I wanted to like this but had to return it for a few reasons. #1. The EIS (electronic image stabilization) for video implemented in the software is basically non-functional in any of the resolutions in the Xiaomi camera. It may have just been me but it just didn't work unlike with my Redmi Note 7. This was the deal breaker defect that made me send the phone back. #2. The screen resolution though AMOLED is 720p. The color temperature is non-adjustable and it's very warm. When you can take pictures and video in 1080p and 4k it doesn't make sense to view them in 720p. Not to mention the screen in grainy; as one reviewer said somewhere, it's as f you can see the individual pixels. #3. Android One isn't all that. Think you'll like stock Android? Get ready to give up all of the little enhancements that the vendor adds to Android that makes it so entertaining and handy. The plus side! #1. The processor, the battery life, memory, and camera are all excellent as well as the build quality of the phone itself. #2. This phone is able to work easily with the Google Camera app that was modified for it (See XDA Developers for more info on GCam). This phone with the Pixel's portrait mode and night sight is a dream come true. Pixel features at Xiaomi prices.

"3786","B07WW25BSV",5,"false","I got the Xiaomi A3 as a successor for a Xiaomi A1. The A1 was a fantastic phone for its price (a third of ""flagship"" phones from other companies) and the A3 is a worthy successor. The A3 improves on the A1 in several areas such as bigger storage (128 GB), better cameras (especially the selfie camera), bigger battery (4000 mAh) and faster charging (18W). It also has some more arguable changes like a OLED display instead of LCD (the jury is still out on which is better - each has different strengths) with a lower resolution (I was worried about the resolution, but in reality the resolution is good enough), fingerprint sensor in the front (I really loved the one on the back which was super-quick, but the one in the front is ok too...), and the glass instead of metal in the back. Thank god that after the wrong turn with the A2, Xioami kept the separate earphone jack in the A3 (although they moved it to the top of the phone). If you're getting this phone for your kids (which I wholeheartedly recommend), they'll love the stylish new look of this phone compared to the ""older"" design of the A1 - plus it has all those cool features the kids love to compare (your phone only has two cameras in the back? my A3 has three! I have 128 GB storage! your phone has those ugly bezels, mine doesn't!). One thing you should be aware of before buying this phone is the real story of its size. Xiaomi calls this a 6.1"" phone, which sounds significantly bigger than the A1's 5.5"". But it is NOT bigger. In fact, it is a smaller phone - it is narrower. Also its viewable screen area is smaller! The viewable screen is taller (without making the phone taller, because the bezels are gone) but it is narrower, resulting in a longer diagonal (this 6.1"" number) but a bit smaller screen area. There's nothing wrong with the bit-longer-but-bit-narrower screen but don't buy this phone expecting it's even bigger than the A1 - it is not. For better (easier to hold in one hand!) and for worse (if you were looking for a huge screen).",1,"Xiaomi"

And the speed. Watching Netflix on the phone is super smooth and clear. The remote blaster is really convenient too. I bought two of these phones (one for my daughter) and she is also impressed. I did not look carefully at the specs and assumed that the protective case I was buying would fit. It didn't because the A3 and A3 Lite are different sizes.

"3818","B07WW25BSV",3,"true","I'm a big Xiaomi fan and I wanted to like this but had to return it for a few reasons. #1. The EIS (electronic image stabilization) for video implemented in the software is basically non-functional in any of the resolutions in the Xiaomi camera. It may have just been me but it just didn't work unlike with my Redmi Note 7. This was the deal breaker defect that made me send the phone back. #2. The screen resolution though AMOLED is 720p. The color temperature is non-adjustable and it's very warm. When you can take pictures and video in 1080p and 4k it doesn't make sense to view them in 720p. Not to mention the screen in grainy; as one reviewer said somewhere, it's as f you can see the individual pixels. #3. Android One isn't all that. Think you'll like stock Android? Get ready to give up all of the little enhancements that the vendor adds to Android that makes it so entertaining and handy. The plus side! #1. The processor, the battery life, memory, and camera are all excellent as well as the build quality of the phone itself. #2. This phone is able to work easily with the Google Camera app that was modified for it (See XDA Developers for more info on GCam). This phone with the Pixel's portrait mode and night sight is a dream come true. Pixel features at Xiaomi prices. Overall, a phone with good bones but an ugly screen and a video recording software glitch. This is a rare misstep for Xiaomi but it's still a good value.",22,"Xiaomi"

"3821","B07X5RRZFP",5,"true","This is one of the best phone values available. It has a high quality OLED display, the fastest Snapdragon 855 CPU and Adreno 640 Graphic chip, looks great and does away with the ""notch"" in the display that usually houses the front-facing ""selfie"" cam in favor of one that automatically pops up from inside. In terms of hardware, the only flaw is 6GB ram instead of the more standard 8GB. So far I haven't noticed that to be an issue, but the extra headroom would be nice. There is one other physical difference from most top-line flagships you should know about: Water resistance. It's rare on other phones in this price range, but phones with similar specs like Pixel 3 and Galaxy S10 are rated to withstand submersion in water about 5 feet deep for up to half an hour. The Mi 9t Pro does not have an IPXX water rating at all. However, one tear down review I saw that opened the phone did notice the same types of rubber bumper seals used in other phones to achieve water resistance, so it's possible this phone would endure at least very quick and shallow submersion. Considering the popup camera though, I wouldn't count on it if you accidentally leave it in your pocket while swimming in the pool. Did I say it looks good? It looks good. The front is the typical edge to edge display, but the back ditches boring solid black or white surfaces for an iridescent, almost holographic look. Find a video of it to fully appreciate. The downside of this, as with any beautiful phone, is that nearly everyone immediately slaps a case on it, obscuring it all behind some bits of cheap plastic. Mi thoughtfully includes a minimalist hard-shell case, which feels nice in the hand (much better than the cheap plastic feel from TPU cases) but it's disappointing that it doesn't match the finish on the phone: It's just a boring matte black. This is somewhat confusing: Why design such a nice shell for the phone only to immediately provide users with something that covers it? The only real annoyance though is the software. Mi shoves a bunch of their own apps into the device when there are much, much better versions built into stock Android or available from Google directly. If you normally use Google apps, you need to pay close attention when first setting up this phone to avoid using the Mi versions instead. As with most vendor bloatware, you're stuck with these, there's no way to uninstall. Then there are all of the little changes, like not having an app drawer, renaming settings slightly and moving them around. The underlying android version is 9, and I came from an older Pixel phone also upgraded to run 9, and the differences were jarring and confusing. If you didn't go looking for it, you'd never know these were running the same underlying version of Android OS. Especially annoying was the default apps settings: Usually on Android you can specify which app you want to use for a task, like default email, browser, etc. Mi sometimes (not always) ignores this. If you don't like their camera app and want to use another from the Play store you can, but all shortcuts like double pressing the power button will ignore your default settings and open the Mi camera app instead. There may be other apps like this too, though the camera is the only one I've found so far. It's relatively minor, but still annoying. Despite the above, this is still a 5-star phone. Even if you look for refurbished phones, it's very difficult to find an alternative to the Mi 9t Pro with the same specs for the same price. ($400 retail, as of this review). Refurbed Pixel 3 XL's go for close to $500 and the newest Samsung or Pixel 4 phones are close to double that, even though they have",5,"Xiaomi"
"3822","B07X5RRZFP",4,"false","I bought this phone in Naples, Italy in a small store. I previously researched many options and finally settled between this phone and slightly more expensive OnePlus 7T. Unfortunately, OnePLus was nowhere to be found and I needed phone urgently (my old LG G5 died) so I went ahead with Xiaomi. Now, here's a long story short: this is an AMAZING phone! It is worth every cent and performance is stunning! Everything runs smoothly, screen is beautiful, design is something you will want to show off in a transparent case for sure! I do have to admit I'm very happy with my purchase and phone is definitely named a ""flagship killer"" with a good reason. For money you pay for it you won't find a better phone. Now, here's the parts where it doesn't deliver, and yeah, it can be a deal breaker for some (and reason I gave it 4 stars). * No SD card slot. - This is my biggest issue, as in today's world 64/128 Gb might not be enough. * No wireless charging - I can live with that, but previous versions of this phone had it, so why they couldn't add it to this one? It would be a cool thing to have. * Spying - you will have to spend an hour or so and dig through ALL of the options and switch off all the insane, intrusive settings that happily grab your personal data. Even Google would be ashamed how deep some of these settings go. Switch it off as soon as you start the phone and check after every system update if they're turned on. Not nice, Xiaomi, not nice at all. * Update to Android 10. - This should be a positive thing, but since the update, some of the options stopped working, like USB tethering or a WiFI hotspot. You can turn them on by turning on the Developer Mode (check online how to do it) but it is shame it doesn't work now and it was working with original Android 9 MIUI. It might be fixed in following updates but for now, you have to use this workaround. Final verdict: an awesome phone, well worth the money you pay for it. If you can pay a bit more, try to get OnePlus 7T but if you want to save some cash, this one will serve its purpose quite well. P.S. I know it is quite improbable, but when you put it in your pocket, do it so that phone is turned up, as it should be - camera tends to pop out and if it is upside down, it can get damaged.",2,"Xiaomi"

"3871","B07X5SHN81",5,"true","Let's be honest. For 380 dollars this phone is very good. The camera? Yeah sure you ll have a little more noise on images compared to a pixel or else but if you don't zoom in to find the little pixel that is wrong you ll be just saving a lot of money! For the same specs as the pixel 4 you get this thing for half the price... You can unlock the bootloader by the way whereas all Huawei phones are locked forever. Honestly I charge the battery every morning during 35 minutes to get it at about 80%. I m using it very often but not playing games and by 11pm I manage to have 25 to 40% of remaining juice from the 80% in the morning... Not bad right? User interface? I don't understand people moaning about it. It just works flawlessly no bugs or slow downs. Full screen gesture is awesome. No more virtual buttons on the screen make it very immersive. A little heavy yes but backed with 4000mah don't forget. Screen brightness perfect. I m coming from Samsung and I can say that the screen is indeed made by Samsung. Not ultra HD but you can't see it anyways starting from 5"" of view distance. Pointless to have more resolution on such a small screen, the more pixel you have the more it drains the battery for something you can't even distinguish... Better save money with this phone to buy a big 4k TV for instance. The pop up cam is very nice but probably not the best again. Be honest with yourself and think about the fact you don't need professional grade selfies 99.99,% of the time so...But I'm not using it a lot anyway so I'm glade it disappears under the screen rather than having those awful notches. Ok last. Under display fingerprint sensor. Except Samsung for note 10 S10 and Apple they all use the same under display camera. It works quite well but not as fast as a regular fingerprint scanner on the back. It misses sometimes but really not bad at all. Here some tricks: you can teach up to 5 different fingerprints so I teached the same finger 3 times to get really fast unlocks. It works quite well.

I will tell everyone I know to never buy Xiaomi.",15,"Xiaomi"
"3885","B07X5SHN81",5,"true","Overall, I'm really pleased with this phone. I use it more for texting, checking work emails, and work-related security such as 2 Factor Authentication and things like network utilities. I don't use social media at all. I'm the kind of person that prefers to get the most bang for my buck. I might go as far as to say I'm cheap, but when the time comes to spend money, I'm willing to do it. To me, this phone represents a great value. I purchased it to replace a $256 Huawei P10 Lite that I had for just over 2 years. The Huawei always worked fine, but lately I started to notice that the battery wasn't holding the charge as long as it did, and wouldn't last 48 hours. I'm sure I could have gotten the phone to last another year, but the time seemed right for an all-around upgrade. I compared the 9T Pro to things like the OnePlus and the Razer 2, but each phone seemed to excel at different things. For me, there was no clear and definitive winner in terms of performance vs screen vs camera vs weatherproofing. But getting the battery size, performance, stereo jack, and triple-camera resolution, I opted for the 9T Pro. The packaging is all slick and a decent presentation. The SIM card was a little difficult to get out, and I was nervous I wasn't going to get it. It's a dual-SIM phone, and I couldn't find a clear definition of which SIM was #1, so I just put my Mint SIM card in one and closed it up. In a minute, I was online and my phone was restoring all my apps. The build of the phone itself seems solid, and I don't feel like I'm holding a toy, or a brick. It's a big, beautiful screen, with practically no bevel around it. I like the colors, and I've turned the brighness up for my old eyes and also run it in 'Dark Mode' which I find much more usable. It seems silly, but looking at my old phone with the notch now seems ridiculous. I liked that the Huawei had the fingerprint reader on the back, but the screen is livable. It can take a second or 2 to identify where I'm supposed to hold my thumb, but it's still quicker than typing a 4-digit code. The phone has no branding or clear indicator on the front, so it's hard to tell if you're picking it up upside down or not. I like that I can scan multiple fingers so I can unlock it with my left or right thumbs or pointer fingers. I did try the face unlock feature, and it works pretty well, maybe even faster than the fingerprint scanner. But in order to be used, it has to pop up the selfie camera, and I just didn't want that happening my mistake or a million times a day. More on that later. The MIUI interface isn't horrible. Like most UI's, is really just takes getting used to before you like it. I don't use any of the Mi software or accounts, just like I didn't use the Huawei versions, so there is a noticable amount of bloatware on the phone. I prefer to stick with my Google account for all things. Luckily, changing the phone to use the default apps like Chrome for the browser aren't too difficult. Some of the newer features of Android, the phone, and MIUI are enjoyable, like the Ambient display, the icon management, app management and so on. The phone seems more able to be customized to my liking than my previous phone, it just takes some digging. I wound up trying several weather apps before I found one that let me put a 4x2 display of the current date and time along with the weather and the last time the weather was retreived, but that's my own personal battle. By accident once I ran a Mi app to clean up the phone, and it put all my defaults back to the Mi apps, but again it wasn't hard to reset them to my liking. Performance wise, I can see a real advantage compared to my older phone. It's definitely snappier in most operations, but this typically means in regards to the UI. The finger unlock is nearly instantaneous once you get used to wear to place your finger. Surfing, videos, games, never seem to leave me waiting. I won't say it's all instaneous, but I will say that the added expense for performance was worth it. The camera performance isn't bad at all, and I like the 3 zoom levels. I would say that performance is again better then my last phone, and photos in decent light are pretty darn presentable and printable. I'm a bit of a snob here, so I won't be giving up my DSLR any time soon, but it's noice to have a camera that can relatively compete with some of the high-grade phone cameras out there. Audio quality and cell service get no complaints from me. The bluetooth and WiFi all work as expected, and it seems like the BlueTooth allowed me to walk away from my BT soundbar a little farther than my previous phone. The selfie camera is a bit of a gimick, and might make some nervous. As you switch to and from the selfie camera, the motorized camera pops up and down respectively. It takes a second to pop up or close, so you don't really notice. Quality is fine. But it does make me nervous that it will break or start popping up while in a pocket or something. With that said, I pretty much never take selfies (I'm not from this generation), so the selfie camera means nothing to me. The battery is awesome, and sitting at my desk yesterday it was going down about 1% an hour. The quick charge feature is very nice, and the wall plug that comes with it is a qiuck charge type, which is a nice bonus. I did find it hard to locate exact specs on what chargers will give fast charging. I believe that 27W QC4.0 charges will go 'Turbo', while 18W QC3 charges will go 'Quick', and regular USB chargers will just charge normal speed. My biggest complaints about the phone is that I wish it were waterproof, and it keeps connecting to open WiFi networks. The waterproof shouldn't really be a problem as I've never damaged a phone from water in 25 years. And I assume that the WiFi option is a setting somewhere (I've found posts that indicate settings that don't exist) or just a utility app I need to install.",NA,"Xiaomi"

Check kimovil for appropriate 4g/3g band coverage, and check a US coverage map to ensure that the proper bands (for me B2 and B5) are covered in your area by your provider. The phone is noticeably thicker than my old OnePlus 3 but the battery is large enough to make up for it. I recommend replacing some of the Mi apps with the regular Google equivalent, but overall the OS is pretty good. The built in themes app has a lot of good community made free options, and the phone can look pretty nice with these enabled.

Be sure to setup GCam Google's Pixel camera software, the Xiaomi software is not great, the Pixel GCam makes the pictures POP. Not many cases are made for it, and the ones that exist have a problem with using the MIUI gestures. I used this to replace a S8+ and am super pleased with the choice so far. The only drawback so far is that the screen has a low resolution compared to the S8+ which is pretty odd, but 1080p+ (horizontal is more than standard 1080p) is the standard screen on all Xiaomi phones. Update: Still super satisfied with the purchase, bought to use with Mint Mobile, so all in this phone and a year of service cost me about $500 or half a flagship Samsung phone without service. Dislike the Mi apps for the most part, but replacing them with other Google apps isn't hard, also would rather have SD card space rather than a second SIM, but for this price, willing to overlook it.

"3969","B07Y8XK9GC",5,"true","As an iPhone owner for 10+ years, I grew tired and frustrated of spending absurd amounts of money everytime a new model came out or the one I was using became obsolete. Not to mention the frustration of how expensive repairs are as well. Due to this I decided to cross the pond and switch to Android under the insistence of my friends saying that Android is ""better"" and ""cheaper"" than Apple. So I decided to research phones, but immediately found out that top notch Android phones are as expensive as it's fruity competitor. Overwhelmed, I called a friend to talk about my dilemma and he said ""you need to get a Redmi Note Pro"". I was like ""Redmi, who?"" Well let me tell you, the Redmi Note Pro 8 sports the following specs: Dual SIM Card Slot, 64 GB (expandable), 6 GB RAM, 64MP AI Quad Camera Array, 2cm Macro and 120¬∞ ultra-wide sensor, High-performance Helio G90T, LiquidCool Technology, Wifi X Antenna,16.58cm (6.53) Dot Notch HDR Display, 500-nits max brightness, Alexa Built-in, 4500mAh high-capacity battery, Type-C 18W Fast Charger, 20MP AI Front Camera, AI Portrait Mode, AI Scene Detection, Helio G90T gaming processor for gaming and is carrier unlocked for use on any cellphone network. Long story short, my friend ultimately sold me on this one. Even though Redmi might not be a recognizable name here in the U.S. it's a major player in the China/India telecommunication markets. Which basically means they can sell their product for a fraction of the cost due to high volume sales and low production costs. If your looking for a decent, cost effective alternative to all the expensive smartphones out there, this is the one for you. At around $250 this phone is a winner!",2,"Xiaomi"

"3974","B07Y8XK9GC",4,"true","Great phone for the price. At first I bought an Umidigi budget phone but that did not adequately meet my needs so it was returned. This phone has everything I need for the price. The only thing I took a star off was because the charger is European version and I really expected the phone to already have a screen protector installed like most budget or overseas unlocked phone. The one I got did not, and I don't really feel like having to dish another $10 bucks or so to order a screen protector when the standard has been pre-installed on most or all phones like this. Maybe someone got lazy overseas and did not put one on but now I have to search for one on Amazon and hope that my screen will be okay in the meanwhile. The phone is fast, looks really amazing (I love the green color--I've never seen this color before on cellphones), and the MIUI is actually not bad even without an app drawer. I do have the Prime Nova Launcher already purchased so eventually I will revert to that launcher but right now just checking out Redmi's MIUI for a feel of it. Right out of the box there was an update to 11 from 10 (I assume the MIUI update). It was a seemless update. So far the signal is good with TMobile for my area and multimedia like Netflix is really snappy and bright. The screen and ratio is good for videos. Haven't tried the camera yet as I am not really a camera person. Will use it eventually and update my review overall in a few weeks or so.",NA,"Xiaomi"

"3978","B07Y8XK9GC",5,"false","If you are looking for a phone for less than $400, this one should be on your short list. If you are looking for one under $300, this may be your new phone. Unverified purchase because I bought a Forest green 64GB/ 6GB Note 8 Pro / SD Card bundle, but since this is so new, I thought I'd post it here. :D What I like: The phone itself looks nice aesthetically. The green is rather striking with the glass exterior. It's easy to hold as it is long and thin. The phone is fast. It loads from powered off to ready for use in 15 seconds. The fingerprint reader is also rather quick. It has a vibrant screen, a screen that stretches over almost the entire face. The touch response is fantastic. Operation while running multiple apps is silky smooth. I scored ~278000 on Antutu benchmark, which seems pretty good (that's slightly better than a Galaxy S9). The camera is good, low light pictures come out nice. I don't use it but it has NFC. There is a small white notification light in the teardrop. The GPS is fast to acquire and accurate. The phone aggressively tries to save your battery life, which is already really good. I can easily get 2 days or regular use. 3 or 4 days of battery life if it's mostly just on standby. Still has a headphone jack and the external speaker is plenty loud for ringtones. Comes with a clear, rubber sleeve. What I don't like: No app drawer. (meet MIUI, the modified android on this phone) Perhaps that can be remedied with a launcher. (I actually like MIUI so I live with no drawer) Phone doesn't come with a proper US charger, it comes with a European(?) plug, an adapter and a standard usb cord. MIUI comes with some ads here and there. Like when you use the play store, you may see one. They can be turned off though (see below). The camera lens protrudes off of the back of the phone, so it isn't flat (without some kind of real case). MIUI isn't vanilla (pure) android (but is still somehow like-able too lol). It's a little heavy (200g) but not crazy heavy. Sound quality from the bottom firing single speaker could be better but I've heard far worse. For $240, this is a pretty fantastic phone. FYI - I'm using mine on TracPhone, using AT&T towers. I had to manually set up the APN to get my mobile network running but that may just be because this phone is so new that it wasn't automatic. To remove ads from Xiaomi MIUI 10: Your phone must be connected to the Internet. Permission can only be revoked online. go to: Settings > Passwords & Security > Authorization & revocation set ""msa"" to Off. (wait for 10 seconds) After waiting, tap Revoke. Once you tap that, you may see: ‚ÄúCouldn't revoke authorization‚Äù. Keep trying until you succeed. (3-5x) Go to: Settings > Additional Settings > Privacy > Ad services Personalized ad recommendations set that to ""Off"".",95,"Xiaomi"

It has NFC, headphone jack, USB-C fast-charging, a very nice display, IR Remote capability, Gorilla glass 5 front AND back, Android 9 (albeit via the MIUI 11 interface) among a host of other features. I went with my Nova Prime Launcher and was able to get everything set up as I was used to on my last phone quickly. There are some things that need to be adjusted in settings to make 3rd party widgets work and to turn off ads in built-in apps, but once those are done, you have a phone that the name-brand companies are selling for at least double the price. Camera is definitely superior to the LG V20 that I upgraded from. Also, the phone has a extremely long-lasting 4500mah battery which - is going to be the big selling point of the new Galaxy S11 - when it comes out. Only two flaws I've found are 1) Google Smart Lock (which allows you to keep the phone unlocked when connected to trusted bluetooth devices) does not function. 2) Netflix & Prime Video only work in standard definition right now.

"4017","B07Y8XK9GC",4,"true","My older phone took a turn for the worse. I decided to give Xiaomi a try and thought the Note 8 Pro looked impressive for the price. I'm thoroughly pleased. Positives The phone feels solid. It has glass on the back. The fingerprint reader is quick. It works well on my carrier (AT&T). The signal has been solid wherever I've gone so far. The camera is solid for this pricepoint. Has a notification light on the front. Has NFC. The battery life is insane, especially after the most recent MIUI update. It can last two to four days easily depending on usage. The MediaTek chipset is no slouch. The phone is snappy and has run countless games without issues. Has SD Card support and an audio jack. The screen has HDR support. Negatives The phone is heavy, heavier than most phones. The fingerprint reader is right under one of the cameras. The screen while big and bright has lighting issues near the borders. Waterdrop notch on the front. SD Card slot isn't separate so it's either dual SIM or SD Card and a SIM. There's some odd video sharpening going on while watching videos. I'm not a big fan of MIUI. Maybe I should give it time, but I'd rather stock android. In conclusion, I don't think there's a better phone at this price point (when I ordered it, It was $210). Yes, Xiaomi's diverse lineup means you don't have to go much higher to get something better, but if your budget is ~$200 then this should be your next phone. Some of the negatives listed above are minor. I don't find the phone that heavy and have no problems handling it with one hand (although my hands are big). I've trained myself on the fingerprint reader's location to not hit the closest camera. The reasons for my 4/5 instead of a perfect score are video sharpening and MIUI. If you watch a video through an app, you will immediately notice that something is off. There will be visible artifacts depending on the source and things will look oversharpened. I don't know what's the cause of this, but I hope this can be fixed with a software update. It's not a dealbreaker for me, but it might be for some who are more sensitive to this type of thing. MIUI, I'm going to say I'm not used to it yet. I'm not returning the phone over it since the phone performs well. I'm just not a fan of MIUI's style and how it shuffles certain things around. Since I've had the phone, it has received two updates so at least it's getting decent support so far. One more thing I should mention since I didn't notice it beforehand. The Mineral Grey listing here is the EU version. I'm not sure what the hardware differences are within the phone, but it came with an EU plug.",10,"Xiaomi"

It has NFC, headphone jack, USB-C fast-charging, a very nice display, IR Remote capability, Gorilla glass 5 front AND back, Android 9 (albeit via the MIUI 11 interface) among a host of other features. I went with my Nova Prime Launcher and was able to get everything set up as I was used to on my last phone quickly. There are some things that need to be adjusted in settings to make 3rd party widgets work and to turn off ads in built-in apps, but once those are done, you have a phone that the name-brand companies are selling for at least double the price. Camera is definitely superior to the LG V20 that I upgraded from. Also, the phone has a extremely long-lasting 4500mah battery which - is going to be the big selling point of the new Galaxy S11 - when it comes out. Only two flaws I've found are 1) Google Smart Lock (which allows you to keep the phone unlocked when connected to trusted bluetooth devices) does not function. 2) Netflix & Prime Video only work in standard definition right now.

Unverified purchase because I bought a Forest green 64GB/ 6GB Note 8 Pro / SD Card bundle, but since this is so new, I thought I'd post it here. :D What I like: The phone itself looks nice aesthetically. The green is rather striking with the glass exterior. It's easy to hold as it is long and thin. The phone is fast. It loads from powered off to ready for use in 15 seconds. The fingerprint reader is also rather quick. It has a vibrant screen, a screen that stretches over almost the entire face. The touch response is fantastic. Operation while running multiple apps is silky smooth. I scored ~278000 on Antutu benchmark, which seems pretty good (that's slightly better than a Galaxy S9). The camera is good, low light pictures come out nice. I don't use it but it has NFC. There is a small white notification light in the teardrop. The GPS is fast to acquire and accurate. The phone aggressively tries to save your battery life, which is already really good. I can easily get 2 days or regular use. 3 or 4 days of battery life if it's mostly just on standby. Still has a headphone jack and the external speaker is plenty loud for ringtones. Comes with a clear, rubber sleeve. What I don't like: No app drawer. (meet MIUI, the modified android on this phone) Perhaps that can be remedied with a launcher. (I actually like MIUI so I live with no drawer) Phone doesn't come with a proper US charger, it comes with a European(?) plug, an adapter and a standard usb cord. MIUI comes with some ads here and there. Like when you use the play store, you may see one. They can be turned off though (see below). The camera lens protrudes off of the back of the phone, so it isn't flat (without some kind of real case). MIUI isn't vanilla (pure) android (but is still somehow like-able too lol). It's a little heavy (200g) but not crazy heavy. Sound quality from the bottom firing single speaker could be better but I've heard far worse. For $240, this is a pretty fantastic phone. FYI - I'm using mine on TracPhone, using AT&T towers. I had to manually set up the APN to get my mobile network running but that may just be because this phone is so new that it wasn't automatic. To remove ads from Xiaomi MIUI 10: Your phone must be connected to the Internet. Permission can only be revoked online. go to: Settings > Passwords & Security > Authorization & revocation set ""msa"" to Off. (wait for 10 seconds) After waiting, tap Revoke. Once you tap that, you may see: ‚ÄúCouldn't revoke authorization‚Äù. Keep trying until you succeed.

"4097","B07Y8YWTFL",5,"true","As an iPhone owner for 10+ years, I grew tired and frustrated of spending absurd amounts of money everytime a new model came out or the one I was using became obsolete. Not to mention the frustration of how expensive repairs are as well. Due to this I decided to cross the pond and switch to Android under the insistence of my friends saying that Android is ""better"" and ""cheaper"" than Apple. So I decided to research phones, but immediately found out that top notch Android phones are as expensive as it's fruity competitor. Overwhelmed, I called a friend to talk about my dilemma and he said ""you need to get a Redmi Note Pro"". I was like ""Redmi, who?"" Well let me tell you, the Redmi Note Pro 8 sports the following specs: Dual SIM Card Slot, 64 GB (expandable), 6 GB RAM, 64MP AI Quad Camera Array, 2cm Macro and 120¬∞ ultra-wide sensor, High-performance Helio G90T, LiquidCool Technology, Wifi X Antenna,16.58cm (6.53) Dot Notch HDR Display, 500-nits max brightness, Alexa Built-in, 4500mAh high-capacity battery, Type-C 18W Fast Charger, 20MP AI Front Camera, AI Portrait Mode, AI Scene Detection, Helio G90T gaming processor for gaming and is carrier unlocked for use on any cellphone network. Long story short, my friend ultimately sold me on this one. Even though Redmi might not be a recognizable name here in the U.S. it's a major player in the China/India telecommunication markets. Which basically means they can sell their product for a fraction of the cost due to high volume sales and low production costs. If your looking for a decent, cost effective alternative to all the expensive smartphones out there, this is the one for you. At around $250 this phone is a winner!",2,"Xiaomi"

"4116","B07Y8YWTFL",4,"true","My older phone took a turn for the worse. I decided to give Xiaomi a try and thought the Note 8 Pro looked impressive for the price. I'm thoroughly pleased. Positives The phone feels solid. It has glass on the back. The fingerprint reader is quick. It works well on my carrier (AT&T). The signal has been solid wherever I've gone so far. The camera is solid for this pricepoint. Has a notification light on the front. Has NFC. The battery life is insane, especially after the most recent MIUI update. It can last two to four days easily depending on usage. The MediaTek chipset is no slouch. The phone is snappy and has run countless games without issues. Has SD Card support and an audio jack. The screen has HDR support. Negatives The phone is heavy, heavier than most phones. The fingerprint reader is right under one of the cameras. The screen while big and bright has lighting issues near the borders. Waterdrop notch on the front. SD Card slot isn't separate so it's either dual SIM or SD Card and a SIM. There's some odd video sharpening going on while watching videos. I'm not a big fan of MIUI. Maybe I should give it time, but I'd rather stock android. In conclusion, I don't think there's a better phone at this price point (when I ordered it, It was $210). Yes, Xiaomi's diverse lineup means you don't have to go much higher to get something better, but if your budget is ~$200 then this should be your next phone. Some of the negatives listed above are minor. I don't find the phone that heavy and have no problems handling it with one hand (although my hands are big). I've trained myself on the fingerprint reader's location to not hit the closest camera. The reasons for my 4/5 instead of a perfect score are video sharpening and MIUI. If you watch a video through an app, you will immediately notice that something is off. There will be visible artifacts depending on the source and things will look oversharpened. I don't know what's the cause of this, but I hope this can be fixed with a software update. It's not a dealbreaker for me, but it might be for some who are more sensitive to this type of thing. MIUI, I'm going to say I'm not used to it yet. I'm not returning the phone over it since the phone performs well. I'm just not a fan of MIUI's style and how it shuffles certain things around. Since I've had the phone, it has received two updates so at least it's getting decent support so far. One more thing I should mention since I didn't notice it beforehand. The Mineral Grey listing here is the EU version. I'm not sure what the hardware differences are within the phone, but it came with an EU plug.",10,"Xiaomi"

"4125","B07Y8YWTFL",4,"true","Great phone for the price. At first I bought an Umidigi budget phone but that did not adequately meet my needs so it was returned. This phone has everything I need for the price. The only thing I took a star off was because the charger is European version and I really expected the phone to already have a screen protector installed like most budget or overseas unlocked phone. The one I got did not, and I don't really feel like having to dish another $10 bucks or so to order a screen protector when the standard has been pre-installed on most or all phones like this. Maybe someone got lazy overseas and did not put one on but now I have to search for one on Amazon and hope that my screen will be okay in the meanwhile. The phone is fast, looks really amazing (I love the green color--I've never seen this color before on cellphones), and the MIUI is actually not bad even without an app drawer. I do have the Prime Nova Launcher already purchased so eventually I will revert to that launcher but right now just checking out Redmi's MIUI for a feel of it. Right out of the box there was an update to 11 from 10 (I assume the MIUI update). It was a seemless update. So far the signal is good with TMobile for my area and multimedia like Netflix is really snappy and bright. The screen and ratio is good for videos. Haven't tried the camera yet as I am not really a camera person. Will use it eventually and update my review overall in a few weeks or so.",NA,"Xiaomi"

"4186","B07YJHXZT6",3,"true","I was looking for a replacement for a kid's phone, she have a xiaomi mi a2 to play games, take pics and message her friends. I thought this would be a good replacement due to the full screen and a 48mp camera to take pics. But it is not much better, in a odd way I thought it was worst. I compared this phone to my Samsung Note 10 and my daughter's Mi a2, this is what I found. To no surprise the Note 10 takes much better pictures, is faster and just better in every way. I am not taking off any stars due to this since the Note 10 is a much better phone. I am giving this 3 star because it is just a little bit better than the Mi A2. It is a better looking phone, it feels like a high end phone while in hand than the A2, it is faster (not by much), more memory, bigger and better screen, but the most important and the item that made me want to buy this phone in the first place was the camera. The camera was subpar considering Xiaomi is advertising how good this camera is. Indoor pics - sucks - The A2 took better pics indoor Night mode - sucks - almost useless - note sure if I am comparing this to the Samsung but its useless Macro - sucks - A2 took better pics and it doesn't even have this option/feature The camera was such a disappointment that I reset the phone and printed out a return label. I did not even take this outdoor to test it, since indoor sucked and might of be half the pics she will take I decided it is not even worth continuing to test it. Good: Faster than the A2, comparable to mid end phones Full body screen Loud speakers - Keyword is loud, not nice sounding Its very nice to look at Price Wide angle camera Bad: Camera - indoor, night, macro, front/selfie camera all sucked Speed - lags a little bit I did not feel that it was worth upgrading to this phone from the A2 even when the A2 is already a year or two older. Thats how bad I thought it is. Either the A2 is really good or this is really bad. This phone on paper should be been easily much better. Like day and night difference. This is why it gets 3 stars.",13,"Xiaomi"

"4370","B07YZLRS3Z",3,"true","I was looking for a replacement for a kid's phone, she have a xiaomi mi a2 to play games, take pics and message her friends. I thought this would be a good replacement due to the full screen and a 48mp camera to take pics. But it is not much better, in a odd way I thought it was worst. I compared this phone to my Samsung Note 10 and my daughter's Mi a2, this is what I found. To no surprise the Note 10 takes much better pictures, is faster and just better in every way. I am not taking off any stars due to this since the Note 10 is a much better phone. I am giving this 3 star because it is just a little bit better than the Mi A2. It is a better looking phone, it feels like a high end phone while in hand than the A2, it is faster (not by much), more memory, bigger and better screen, but the most important and the item that made me want to buy this phone in the first place was the camera. The camera was subpar considering Xiaomi is advertising how good this camera is. Indoor pics - sucks - The A2 took better pics indoor Night mode - sucks - almost useless - note sure if I am comparing this to the Samsung but its useless Macro - sucks - A2 took better pics and it doesn't even have this option/feature The camera was such a disappointment that I reset the phone and printed out a return label. I did not even take this outdoor to test it, since indoor sucked and might of be half the pics she will take I decided it is not even worth continuing to test it. Good: Faster than the A2, comparable to mid end phones Full body screen Loud speakers - Keyword is loud, not nice sounding Its very nice to look at Price Wide angle camera Bad: Camera - indoor, night, macro, front/selfie camera all sucked Speed - lags a little bit I did not feel that it was worth upgrading to this phone from the A2 even when the A2 is already a year or two older. Thats how bad I thought it is. Either the A2 is really good or this is really bad. This phone on paper should be been easily much better. Like day and night difference. This is why it gets 3 stars.",13,"Xiaomi"
"4371","B07YZLRS3Z",1,"true","For someone who is unfamiliar with the terms for foreign produced cell phones, international sounds like it would work internationally. Many of the questions are ""will this work with X network"" and people reply yes, it is an international phone. International phones are not produced to work particularly well in the US, and do not often have the LTE bands necessary to have good service. CHECK THE BANDS NECESSARY WITH YOUR PROVIDER! Also, these often tend to be Chinese versions of the phone with the Global ROM flashed over the original Chinese ROM. This means that you could have issues with updates and such, limiting your use and enjoyment of the phone. This phone may work well for you, however, make sure it works with your network and that you do want the international version instead of the global version.",14,"Xiaomi"

"4402","B07Z8BL2VW",5,"true","Bought this as a backup/travel device, been using it for a week before writing a review. Overall useful as a daily phone for most tasks outside maybe pubg or COD. Performance: This is the 2GB version and it's responsive enough to handle most web browsing in chrome or firefox mobile, hangouts video chats, Discord, and basic day to day office tasks you'd need for work. Everything feels quite responsive outside a few minor things I believe are bugs in the recent MIUI 11 update on the phone I am sure will be worked out, enabling wif/blutooth is a tad slow but works. If you aren't going to push this phone to gaming you should be fine for most all tasks feeling responsive. CPU is a bit weaker as this phone is geared at battery life over performance. Battery: With office tasks, ~2-3 hours of youtube 480p, discord, and some web browsing. I was down to about 20% after 3.5 days from 100%. This was with me enabling battery saver from 20:00-7:00 and using android dark mode, mileage may vary depending. Overall this is a perfect phone for anyone planning to be out all day and cares more about their phone lasting the full day(or two) than being able to game on the go. Features: Lacks NFC, Fingerprint, and some other things but overall it's not a deal breaker. Fast charging is nice, headphone jack, FM radio, IR blaster are as well; but this phone ships with a 10w charger for full Q.C. you can, and should, get an 18w charger as the battery will need it to go from 20%->100% in a reasonable time. Screen is not 2k but looks good enough even with full brightness not to be bad, it does tend to wash out a bit in full color but it's nothing offensive. Dual sim + SD card is really good for travel. Camera: This won't win any awards but for most pictures it looks and acts fine, plenty of reviews for the full images out there though I will say the latest update did fix a few things with quality. I hear you can also side load the gcam in but I haven't tried it yet. The camera is good enough to get the job done, the AI mode can help a few minor touches as well. If you're just going to share daytime pictures with people via social media, this camera will get the job done with ease but it's no pixel/hawuei camera. Overall good phone for travel or a phone for someone non-power user. Going to be using this on a few of my trips so that I don't need to worry so much on a power bank wherever I go. Things to keep in mind not all 4g bands supported in USA disable ads in MIUI via turning off ""suggestions"" get an 18W wall charger for best charge times this does not come with any case, while it is sturdy would suggest a case",1,"Xiaomi"

"4405","B07Z8BL2VW",5,"true","Bought this after 1ft drop cracked my Samsung Galaxy S9+ and although it lacks some features I'll miss, finger print reader, NFC, and wireless charging, this phone has enough going for it that at less than 1/5 the price what it does have and the quality puts it at top of the value proposition for cell phones. Face unlock is quick enough that I only slightly miss the finger print reader. 5000mAh battery helps overcome the convenience of wireless charging. I'll miss the NFC as backup to my credit cards but only a lower tier feature for me. 32GB storage is usable, the expandable SD storage makes tolerable, even though moving apps to SD doesn't appear possible. Biggest drawback I've found at this point that I've had some issues with weak WiFi signal pickup, no issue at home but have struggled to get strong signal at work. Still working through some of the quirks of the Xiaomi interface but expect overtime i'll become more familiar with it, fairly intuitive just different. I haven't spent much time with the camera and evaluating image quality so cannot comment there but with everything else going for it it frankly doesn't matter to me. Only been using for 24 hours so longer term use may expose some flaws but at this point no question at $110 I would buy again and recommend.",1,"Xiaomi"
